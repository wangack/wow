[0:08:55] FUSenh: fun time to be a wow player :D both games got me excited
[0:09:03] Pygsystim: I'm guessing Ven saw the huge stam increase for dragonflight?
[0:09:21] AJBilder: no shave november already thick for you bro
[0:09:22] zerozhr: its just silly that 10 years ago people got it so easy but now its like 2 cars worth, better to just make it easy accessable Madge
[0:09:40] kingkind: Why though
[0:09:46] frifladdran: What do you think about shaman in general for Dragonflight pvp? :)
[0:09:56] zerozhr: in mop it was like 200k i've heard
[0:10:53] Renethadox: this is
[0:11:02] zerozhr: im sure ur right, but then also look at the amount of people that have invested the amount its worth now  in recent years, maybe a hundred? vs like the thousands and thousands that want it idk
[0:11:02] Renethadox: shadowlands?
[0:11:11] novokaine47: What was the stam change
[0:11:27] kingkind: Dude Raiku insists that lonely winter is too op to choose pet over it, what u think?
[0:11:28] iloveyalunn: 40% stam buff, pretty nutty wonder how its gonna play out
[0:11:33] hovnosesejremzarafkemjzd: Just give less procs on shatter and buff the icelance / frostbolt dmg by 40% 4Head
[0:11:55] mircaeye: retail wow looks like fortnite
[0:11:57] zerozhr: if it was worth that much and rare since the get go,  invilcible was hard to get since the start not easy in the past
[0:12:15] egrounds: I got invisible on my 2nd attempt like a year ago, I've been trying for the firelands egg for 4 years, never got it. RnG :(
[0:12:24] zerozhr: at least i have jmorph FeelsGoodMan
[0:13:16] supatease: everyone who walks into a martial artist dojo should be instant black belt
[0:13:19] donotcrit: just saw everyone gets 40% hp in dragonflight
[0:13:34] donotcrit: surely no one dies anymore
[0:13:50] Dimow: they get 40% more dmg too
[0:13:56] DennisTried: yo is that yung ruki in the building? within the facility? now streaming live on twitch?´I'm Pog ing
[0:14:06] kreyzy8: wait 40%??
[0:14:16] Biznezzx: creatures do more damage not players
[0:14:17] frifladdran: You already got snow?
[0:14:20] undertreex: have you made an ele talent guide??
[0:14:21] DennisTried: did you still go to the gym afterwards?
[0:14:21] zerozhr: 40% in wrath ?
[0:14:22] sweezymcdaniels: Is arcane a decent spec now
[0:14:25] supatease: people really want that dopamine hit from a new mount only to forget it exists a week later because they did nothing to get it
[0:14:50] kingkind: I dont have 85% of the so called rare/removed items and honestly it doesnt bother me and im glad for the ppl that obtained them, the only thing that i would like back is the challenge sets from MoP, like the artifact appearances being accessible again they should put that back as well
[0:14:52] quickswiftfast: IS fire RMP Dead? fire blast breaking cc is so scuffed
[0:14:53] zerozhr: but u cant grind magic rooster Sadge i wish there was a daily i had to do 1,000 times in a row to earn it
[0:15:07] quickswiftfast: Broke my partners blind like 4 times yesterday lol
[0:15:11] rizw0w: remember, were all going to be riding dragons anyway in a few weeks rukiCool
[0:15:14] kreyzy8: oh this looks fun KEKW
[0:15:19] donotcrit: People complaining about burst before, now everyone is going to say AWS is boring
[0:15:49] Luigicamp: but but, my dopamine fun
[0:16:13] zerozhr: DansGame its a game doe
[0:16:42] supatease: cs in wrath guranteed ends the game
[0:16:48] supatease: cs into full sheep target is higher hp than before the cs
[0:17:31] quickswiftfast: mage damage is so bad atm
[0:17:31] hovnosesejremzarafkemjzd: Man frostbolts and ice lance just dont do dmg
[0:17:47] supatease: can i get a gifted sub please chat someone help a boomkin out
[0:18:01] tinspoon: I just tuned in and have to watch 8 ads DansGame
[0:18:31] quickswiftfast: My combust damage went down ~150K
[0:19:04] Luigicamp: Luigicamp gifted a Tier 1 sub to supatease! They have given 1809 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:19:18] supatease: @Luigicamp Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:19:31] Luigicamp: 👍
[0:20:09] zerozhr: wild they did a flat -25% dmg to enh, ive never seen a patchnote before with such a flat r i p
[0:21:04] supatease: u should be able to kill static totem
[0:21:05] tinspoon: ive been kicking that immune static totem for days
[0:21:12] physiczx1: @venruki random question, but what healer you think will be best for healing melee cleaves in df?
[0:21:16] supatease: i can on beta
[0:21:21] zerozhr: i really hope all the recent tuning is based solo off beta, with coves in retail the game seems diff than it will be in df
[0:21:24] DennisTried: @supatease does that imply that you aren't able to and you wish you would be?
[0:21:27] kreyzy8: just another bug I guess :D
[0:21:32] zionzorshin: blizz hates shams lul

[0:23:36] Lunchbox23: what are your thoughts on 40% more stam at lvl 70?
[0:23:44] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:23:51] vulkox666: w8 till u get dumpsters by the ape chimpazee class
[0:23:59] Theo300: Theo300 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[0:23:59] zerozhr: wait 40% is retail?
[0:24:36] dwarfmastuh: is stam change live on beta?
[0:24:36] law4d93: what you thinking the main mage spec is going to be in DF?
[0:24:49] supatease: dont worry hes gonna have 40% more hp
[0:24:51] nikthevoker: LMFAO
[0:24:51] trfadventures: Demon form they have a lot of leech and lifesteal
[0:24:51] supatease: KEKW
[0:24:51] INnoV: dh magic dmg passive
[0:25:03] vulkox666: like 25% magic dmg reduction passively for dh
[0:25:22] kingkind: DH is just not the target, that thing is broken in so many ways
[0:25:29] tinspoon: darkness OP
[0:25:32] supatease: DH aff lock are best classes on pre patch
[0:25:41] DennisTried: just win 4Head
[0:25:42] McLarge: I think that's honestly more of an issue with Frost Mage than with DHs. A free casting Lock or Ele Sham would blast them at least a little bit
[0:25:52] tinspoon: supa, what are you maining in DF
[0:25:54] vulkox666: @supatease also the easyest to play
[0:26:23] McLarge: I almost wonder if Arcane would pump more while free casting?
[0:26:36] law4d93: main mage spec for DF??
[0:26:53] Severis: i LOVED your voice acting there ven
[0:26:57] McLarge: I think RMP and double Mage is still Fire.
[0:27:02] zerozhr: i havnt seen like any fire mages, hope people are testing them lol
[0:27:03] donotcrit: waiting to not be bottom damage
[0:27:18] law4d93: yeah not enjoying mage atm feels really under par when you have broken specs like warlocks XD
[0:27:33] Cryolith_: Tried them all and my personal favourite for shuffle is Arcane, I´m trying to play without conduits or covenant spells lol.
[0:27:43] zerozhr: ive been testing evoker a lot on beta, its so similar to hpal
[0:27:44] McLarge: I haven't seen any Demonology players yet
[0:27:46] DeathDealer575: 1 raiders from DeathDealer575 have joined! 
[0:27:54] trfadventures: I am just glad the honor upgrade gear stuff is gone.. Makes pvp alts so much easier
[0:28:02] megalo559: It’s feels like nothing does in retail? Maybe Iv just been playing too much wrath ? Lol
[0:28:32] leeka: dampening and always a potato at lower ratings
[0:28:41] McLarge: Maybe dampening should ramp that fast in normal rated 3s and 2s?
[0:28:44] zerozhr: i played a lot of retail 2s last night, aff locks are monkaTOS
[0:29:07] leeka: @McLarge thatll just force people to afk at the start more wont it?
[0:29:30] zerozhr: destro seems strong too but its cause they are cheating using necro cove, hitting 120k burst incins
[0:29:42] McLarge: @McLarge Less, I would think. Some comps literally can't die until 60% damp anyway
[0:29:54] McLarge: So bring damp up faster would solve that issue
[0:30:36] kangarooswtf: Oh god, that reminds me of that low lvl boomie murdering you @ bfa launch
[0:30:41] kangarooswtf: That shit went viiiiral
[0:30:51] ThaMeista: wpvp is just a waste of time, unless theres something huge set up then it's just an inconvenience
[0:30:56] kammany2: do you think a fix for tanks in solo shuffle is allowing for cross kills, sometimes i feel like even if my guy dies i have a chance to kill someone on the other team
[0:31:28] kammany2: yeah i dont think tank games are fun either i just watched ur yt vid
[0:31:29] McLarge: Tank games should literally just be 3 tanks vs 3 tanks
[0:31:53] McLarge: Let them have their time out games where nothing dies and let the rest of us queue normally
[0:32:05] zerozhr: What dr is sleep ? fear? speaking for evokers sleep walk spell
[0:32:07] ekologiisk: I like the talents n stuff, i would say, up the damage abit and we should be ok
[0:32:35] McLarge: Sleep I think is Polymorph DR?
[0:32:36] dritful: How is the damage as fire atm?
[0:32:42] kammany2: do you know when the leaver penalty of losing rating is added?
[0:32:47] kammany2: is that just for beta
[0:33:09] Dimow: @venruki Thoughts on "Slow" as frost?
[0:33:10] McLarge: MW Monks should know. Can you Para into Song?
[0:33:25] lucasthebestx: can they give us wotlk s7
[0:33:27] lucasthebestx: or classic cata
[0:33:39] tinspoon: @McLarge yep
[0:33:46] zerozhr: did they nerf the glacial build? i know u enjyoed that on beta
[0:33:58] McLarge: Hmm. If you can Para into Song, then Sleep is definitely not Poly DR
[0:34:04] SloppyWalrus_: yoooo Ven, did you comment on the 40% hp buff at lvl 70 yet?
[0:34:13] CyborgsTV: yoyo wassup how come that u play retail :P
[0:34:35] eraser9: I am not bitter. But DF kinda not look like WoW xD
[0:34:39] Snypes_SYCO: @zerozhr I don't think they did.  I hit 56-75k crits with it.
[0:34:42] hovnosesejremzarafkemjzd: Im playing it with full mastery and glacials do 90k crits 4Head
[0:34:42] Moobot: Latest video "This Could KILL Rated Solo Shuffle In Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/Ot5dDaFeieY
[0:35:00] gamernick410: sub to venruki for a better life
[0:35:20] leeka: we are suppose to get snow next week in poco
[0:35:31] 3mirrors: it's snowing here too, except we weren't expecting it PepeHands
[0:35:34] eraser9: where you live?
[0:35:35] Lodurrr: Yea. Snowing nice and good.
[0:35:37] freelofear: snow is so aids
[0:35:42] Lunchbox23: how does retail scale to crazy numbers in one expansion and classic hasnt catch up in 3?
[0:35:42] nameyourform: dang snow already?
[0:35:46] divinease: good timing ordering snow tires
[0:35:55] SloppyWalrus_: what are you thoughts on the 40% increased hp at lvl 70 now?
[0:36:00] frifladdran: Good reason to not leave your home during dragonflight release
[0:36:02] CyborgsTV: last time we where talking about wrath so i thogh u love wrath more then retail
[0:36:08] sweetstuff40: you playin void elf? is that he now stuff?
[0:36:15] Geekk17: I just drove my motorcycle to work in Ontario lol
[0:36:31] CyborgsTV: thats cool man i like that!
[0:36:40] tv_raz: i love wrathtail and hate reking
[0:36:49] Dellden: i never understood the classic vs retail stuff
[0:36:57] gamernick410: yallgernades GIGACHAD
[0:37:01] Vademiica: !build
[0:37:05] McLarge: You know Ven, I've had a realization. I think the reason you don't like Fire Mage in Retail is because it's not a "turret" archetype, it's a "control" archetype. That's the same reason you love Frost Mage in Retail and Fire in Wrath
[0:37:20] McLarge: You like sitting back and blasting damage
[0:37:45] McLarge: I'm not saying you don't like control, I'm saying you don't like relying on your control alone
[0:38:06] 3mirrors: imo if you can control but not punish with damage it's a little boring
[0:38:18] Vademiica: Have you tested glacial spike? thoughts on it atm?
[0:38:30] CyborgsTV: there is only 1 problem with mage - to squishy
[0:38:47] CyborgsTV: compaired to locks? :D
[0:38:52] Axtin: just got into a solo shuff after 10 min and someone instantly left before the first round
[0:39:01] 3mirrors: i like glass cannons, that's always been my mage class fantasy
[0:39:03] McLarge: Maybe in Wrath you could say Mages are squishy
[0:39:06] tv_raz: no lets make everyone special so no one is
[0:39:11] BlucherPVP: but mages feel so squishy against classes that have purge
[0:39:19] akillabg: feldrake inc for everyone don't miss out
[0:39:25] dritful: Is fire lackluster if you have combust on cd?
[0:39:26] CyborgsTV: no i dont want mage to be op but i also dont want that every class can purge my alter or my shields etc.
[0:39:41] McLarge: As a DH, I feel squishy into Rogues and Ferals.
[0:39:43] zerozhr: Dirty inter
[0:39:44] freelofear: welcome to solo shuffle
[0:39:46] tv_raz: welcome to rated solos
[0:39:47] tinspoon: LUL
[0:39:47] McLarge: And that's about it
[0:40:16] kidzorn: Did they nerfe some classes already?
[0:40:23] McLarge: Oh and Fury Warriors in Seasons 3 and 4 of Shadowlands. Felt hella squishy into that
[0:40:54] DennisTried: cheeky ass cream?
[0:41:33] fightmilk15: Honestly retail is too hard and complex for me and i think for alot of people like me
[0:41:45] McLarge: Azzcream literally just sat in Ring of Fire for nearly the full duration and it didn't even break his Fleshcraft LUL
[0:41:57] zerozhr: They should make it where healers are perma grp leader, so my frames dont break Sadge
[0:42:46] McLarge: It burns you for 24% of your health over the duration, right?
[0:42:55] haris7: thoughts on the ww nerfs? sorry if already discussed
[0:43:05] McLarge: Which would mean his Fleshcraft was bigger than 24% of his health LUL
[0:43:09] freelofear: @zerozhr yea its actually so aids, being on a different frame every round lol
[0:43:47] McLarge: Immediately CS'd on veins FeelsBadMan
[0:44:09] tahmuu: i love how the boomie keeps kiting his healer
[0:44:28] s_k1t: does this seem like it'll be the new go-to thing to play?
[0:45:00] freelofear: the mmr system right now is really bad tho
[0:45:03] s_k1t: oh god I think I just got an ad and totally missed your answer...
[0:45:10] McLarge: DKs cannot die, no
[0:45:17] MrDeadDorian: @venruki make a man out of you is best song for a gym imo Kappa
[0:45:30] McLarge: They have a talent at the top of their tree that buffs Deathstrike healing by 60%
[0:45:59] McLarge: And towards the bottom they can get Will of the Necropolis that just gives them a 30% wall while 35% health or lower
[0:46:35] Profess88: its not about deathstrike, its the magic shield talent and the 35% shield below 30%
[0:46:44] Profess88: 35% wall I mean
[0:47:11] McLarge: Deathstrike definitely plays a part. You can't burst them unless they're stunned/disarmed because they'll just top themselves with Death Strike
[0:47:16] Borngood: enjoying the foot of snow?
[0:47:42] Profess88: Sure, but if it was just deathstrike wouldnt be as big an issue. 15% leech in licheborne also
[0:47:58] Profess88: If you look at the DK's healing at the end of the game, it will be mostly the magic shield if he is running that talent.
[0:48:02] INnoV: icelance seems do be doing some dam
[0:48:03] 3mirrors: POGGIES
[0:48:06] zerozhr: alright thats enough solo shuffle for me, third one in a one somebody leaves with like 1 round left to go, rating not change KEKW
[0:48:17] stormlightcookie: am i crazy or has frost bomb been a talent for mage in the past?
[0:48:20] McLarge: Oh for sure. It's that, Will of the Necropolis, Spell Warding, AMS, AMZ, and Lichborne Leech
[0:48:23] akillabg: we got a dusting last night not much yet
[0:48:25] Borngood: :O
[0:48:26] kreyzy8: monkaS
[0:48:28] 3mirrors: did it reach 30cm?
[0:48:31] McLarge: Oh, and IBF is a 2 minute CD now
[0:48:38] tv_raz: i bet it does g et old pretty fast with that much snow
[0:48:44] StromicusRex: its still warm here Sadge
[0:49:01] Luigicamp: @3mirrors he said 1ft so yeah
[0:49:06] divinease: I live in MN and understand snow. Thankfully its not even close to that here yet, its 74°F for some reason but I'll take it!
[0:49:09] Profess88: I live in San Diego, miss the snow this time of year :(
[0:49:11] Mafinky: thats crazy to think, im on day 12 of growing grass in my front yard
[0:49:17] McLarge: Mes was playing Frost on the beta earlier today at the end of his stream. He said this version of Frost DK feels stronger than the Legion version
[0:49:44] Profess88: Frost DK can have some big hits, but feels somewhat like a 1 trick pony
[0:49:46] ryan17st: god if there's one thing I love in PvP it's fucking pets everywhere...
[0:50:02] McLarge: And he thinks that both the Death Strike talent and Will of the Necropolis should be, and will be, cut in half for PvP
[0:50:11] Profess88: yeah they should
[0:50:14] conswaelo: Great pvp so far Ven doesn’t need to move
[0:50:16] conswaelo: Afk cast
[0:50:27] SloppyWalrus_: just wait for the 40% hp buff, and then frostbolt will do negative dmg
[0:51:06] quickswiftfast: Is this going to be the first xpac where rmp is bad?
[0:51:21] McLarge: @quickswiftfast Definitely not lol
[0:51:29] mikehaawk92: hello my friends
[0:51:35] McLarge: RMP has too much synergy to ever be bad.
[0:51:45] mikehaawk92: i wish everyone here a good day and much health for your family
[0:52:05] McLarge: In order to make it bad, they'd have to have their control taken away or be unable to kill in their control windows
[0:52:06] mikehaawk92: if you read this, i love you
[0:52:06] quickswiftfast: Feels horrible atm
[0:52:20] 3mirrors: not to mention RMP is a comfort pick for so many players and they know it in and out
[0:52:23] 3mirrors: it will always be good
[0:52:26] quickswiftfast: I'm a multiglad Mage player man - shit feels miserable
[0:52:28] McLarge: DKs take no damage.
[0:52:35] Soulaxer: why does every class in the game heal for like millions of damage
[0:52:35] quickswiftfast: Fire breaks cc now, frost and arcane don't feel lik ethey have the burst
[0:52:45] quickswiftfast: :*(
[0:52:53] Soulaxer: pika and xar were playing and both of them would heal more than they damage. on a rogue and mage
[0:52:54] McLarge: Yeah, Mes was saying that DKs are too tanky right now
[0:53:05] McLarge: Mes, of all people LUL
[0:53:06] Pulciu: class envy
[0:53:46] dolby24j: its prepatch
[0:54:29] Soulaxer: @dolby24j its prepatch! Its only 11.1! Guys its only 11.2 ofc they'll fix in the last patch of the xpac! Guys cmon next xpac is around the corner!! They'll fix it then
[0:54:49] Soulaxer: Its only beta Kappa
[0:54:52] SloppyWalrus_: @Soulaxer bingo
[0:55:20] SloppyWalrus_: boomkin in a rough spot rn
[0:55:25] minno_09: they hotfixed warlock sweet souls healthstone heal it was double healing before and nerfed dark pact in instanced PVP to 300% absorb from 500%     you're paying 20% HP for a shield that does 60% HP shield
[0:55:26] onuar_official: yo ven, what do you think of DB into new aoe stun? you can even combo it with frostbomb and glacial
[0:55:32] McLarge: Boomkins are pretty hard to do well with, from what I've seen
[0:55:58] divinease: the best idea about solo shuffle is you can get on and arena instead of knowing people to arena with and having the right players on... I'd love that in wotk.
[0:56:02] Steef12: yeah, I was the boomy and I have no idea how to play it.  Random alt I never play
[0:56:03] Steef12: :)
[0:56:38] zionzorshin: is arcane fun
[0:56:38] ratherval7: How do you unlock voidelf?
[0:56:42] SloppyWalrus_: sucks bc the fast clone was nerfed
[0:56:47] mikehaawk92: hello ven my boi, how would you rate the state of retail atm?
[0:56:48] LopTwo: !ui
[0:56:49] McLarge: @ratherval7 Legion content.
[0:56:55] Steef12: also, I don't think I even have full S4 gear
[0:57:05] Borngood: fast clone was toxic bad design, instant for feral is fine
[0:57:15] Borngood: on a CD
[0:57:43] McLarge: I definitely don't agree that they were immortal
[0:58:16] SloppyWalrus_: just wait for the 40% hp buff they just posted on wowhead
[0:58:25] donnyhelix: is arcane any good/fun on retail? @venruki
[0:58:25] SloppyWalrus_: frostbolt will do zero dam
[0:58:26] McLarge: They certainly have a lot of self healing. But there are also a lot of really strong MS effect
[0:58:50] Volurex: clone and conoke, boomies shredded
[0:59:10] xplaynz: Hey Venruki, how does holy priest doing?
[0:59:19] McLarge: Boomkins auto lost to RPS and Fury Warrior teams, from what I saw of the rank 1 pushes from mvq playing DH/Boomkin
[0:59:22] onuar_official: @venruki have you tried DB into new frost stun? maybe combo with frostbomb?
[0:59:28] pSTOp: Rate retail on a scale of PVE to PVP KEKW
[0:59:36] auzzylol: Hows the latest tuning for DF?
[0:59:42] Borngood: need to balance the game to a playable state to give real feedback, feels like a waste of time atm
[0:59:44] cburo: aff locks are disgusting
[0:59:47] Probab1e: Aren't prepatches always weird, or is it something deeper causing the imbalance?
[1:00:02] onuar_official: is it not possible to DB into the stun since it does no damage, it should be unavoidable?
[1:00:15] Borgirsson: well take balance with a grain of salt it being in pre patch and beta changes coming left and right
[1:00:18] leeka: thats a lot of solo shuffle
[1:00:19] Meridius_X: can you say it again? :D
[1:00:23] freelofear: yea soulrend dot is busted hits for like 20k
[1:00:28] shiftzR: what would you say is better now for pvp - void elf or human for ally ?
[1:00:34] XyanWW: Thoughts on windwalker after nerf?
[1:00:37] zlumageone: resilance will fix it
[1:00:40] alars84: @Probab1e yeah i wonder the same thing - what's due to prepatch and beta feedbback still coming in
[1:00:44] nameyourform: I feel like DH just presses W and eye beam/hunt and win
[1:00:54] blackheart1110: The amount of abilities you have in your main bars now because of DF mage is insane
[1:00:55] FlowersAnger: what kind of class is evoker? is it similar to mage?
[1:00:55] Soulaxer: Any sort of feedback in prepatch is a waste anyway bc of conduits legendaries and covenants. What a poor decision
[1:01:03] FUSenh: enhance got guuuttted :9
[1:01:13] Tgibson2k7: enhance isn't good now?
[1:01:25] nameyourform: no it didnt @FUSenh it got balanced
[1:01:33] Tgibson2k7: thought I heard shamans got a buff
[1:01:38] Roxxybolts: Did you get your gold back?
[1:01:39] nike_rise: ven im still so disappointed you gathered 23 people of their own free will and took 20% of their gold kekw
[1:01:40] mikehaawk92: you ever tried mage/boomkin/heal in wotlk? duuuude thats so much fun
[1:01:42] McLarge: @nameyourform They still have to CC the Healer, but mostly yeah. It's a very high sustained damage class
[1:01:48] INnoV: dunno if its a hot take or not but ww after wod is bad designed
[1:02:06] cydewaysz: 99999 hp lol
[1:02:13] zelux05: @nike_rise ruki1D ruki1D
[1:02:13] Sosatko: Ven thoughts on me spending 46k for turning tide kekw

[1:02:26] Roxxybolts: I put it in the mail check really quick
[1:02:30] Borngood: NO WAY LOL
[1:02:34] itsnotkt: no worth at all
[1:02:34] Sosatko: oh yes way
[1:02:36] blackheart1110: What race is best for mages in DF? Still Human?
[1:02:44] mikehaawk92: turning tide is huge cock so totally worth
[1:02:47] nightmxz: It might not drop ever again, gotta take it when you can
[1:03:07] Roxxybolts: I got banned after that GDKP last night so I wanted to make sure you got your gold back
[1:03:07] McLarge: @blackheart1110 Undead, Human. Probably Undead more so, since Blink gets you out of stuns but not fears
[1:03:08] cburo: Aff locks seem a bit over tuned rn
[1:03:12] blackheart1110: The 10min staff in eye is so underrated
[1:03:20] blackheart1110: 10man*
[1:03:21] Borngood: @Roxxybolts banned?>?
[1:03:45] McLarge: Btw can I just say that Male Undead Mage is Pog
[1:03:49] Volurex: @mikehaawk92 whats turning tide?
[1:03:51] tv_raz: @Roxxybolts roxxybolts alive?
[1:03:52] nike_rise: @Borngood i woulda spend 60k
[1:04:05] Borngood: @nike_rise lmao
[1:04:08] blackheart1110: I’m tired of my undead mage so looking for a change @mclarge
[1:04:10] Borngood: @nike_rise thats crazy
[1:04:18] mikehaawk92: undead BiS
[1:04:19] Vademiica: tauren or panda c",)
[1:04:19] nightmxz: void elf #1 easily
[1:04:23] Roxxybolts: Yeah it said I was investigated for RMT and banned me no idea what’s going on
[1:04:33] Borngood: @Roxxybolts ???
[1:04:44] Roxxybolts: That’s what I’m saying
[1:04:44] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[1:04:49] Borngood: hello?
[1:04:50] tv_raz: @Roxxybolts its cause you dont stream enough
[1:04:51] nike_rise: @Borngood when you watch torch get yoinked from you at 46k youd do whatever it takes
[1:04:55] McLarge: @blackheart1110 Human is fine. Skill Capped said that Panda is actually BiS for Shadowlands, and DF looks to be pretty similar. Could also just play a Tauren LUL
[1:05:05] Borngood: that doesnt seem right
[1:05:19] Roxxybolts: Yeah I literally have 4k gold on my account and I got that in a GDKP last night
[1:05:27] Roxxybolts: And got banned right after
[1:05:29] EricTheSwedishGuy: VEN I'M FINALLY GOING TO VISIT CANADA Pog
[1:05:35] blackheart1110: For the love of god no. The animation looks so weird as Tauren
[1:05:36] Borngood: maybe some1 in gdkp was dirty
[1:05:47] EricTheSwedishGuy: Been wanting to go for yearssss
[1:05:48] chili24: appeal it. That happened to a guild mate of mine after a GDKP and they lifted it
[1:05:54] pSTOp: The IGDKPRS gotchu
[1:05:58] light_of_heart: are you sure you wanna loot that gold
[1:06:12] Borngood: I guess running/doing random gdkps are risky
[1:06:13] egrounds: IF you send anything over 5,000 gold in the mail system it's flagged
[1:06:15] MrDeadDorian: @venruki wich race will be best for the mages in new expansion your thoughts?
[1:06:21] DennisTried: you're not getting banned. chat, stop being mean
[1:06:28] Roxxybolts: I’m not even good enough to Boost for money LUL not have I ever bought gold
[1:06:33] mukkimage: I believe it important to mention the magnificence of your quiff. Bravo. :|
[1:06:35] tinspoon: tax evasion
[1:06:37] Roxxybolts: Nor*
[1:06:37] tv_raz: ive sent 100k gold  and never been banned thats a joke

[1:07:09] chlorophyllkid: when you were a young boy?

[1:07:17] DennisTried: who's laughing now?
[1:07:18] zelux05: top tier insult
[1:07:23] DennisTried: that's right, you
[1:07:24] nike_rise: yeah i used to lactate at recess and would always get picked on
[1:07:27] chlorophyllkid: your father took you to the city?
[1:07:30] mikehaawk92: kids on my days called me big dick man, never complained
[1:07:32] yall_wild: The only time someone picked on me in HS was to make fun of my earlobes since they are attached to head as opposed to droopy. I was so confused
[1:07:32] nameyourform: stickin up hair, wow thats creative
[1:07:35] nightmxz: damn that mob must be an elite, you had to use a 1min cd to kill it Kappa
[1:07:36] Roxxybolts: I sent your 6k in the mail last night and I made 5k from the GDKP it’s so random but apparently it’s unappealable?
[1:07:39] McLarge: Is Spell Steal still free for Arcane?
[1:07:47] brewtank: @venruki have you talked about your 40% already?? I’m interested in your thoughts?
[1:07:56] Borngood: @Roxxybolts how long is the ban? that sucks u cant compete for 6 months now
[1:07:57] tv_raz: @Roxxybolts its unappealable because fuck you thats why
[1:07:58] moojerk: Hey Ven are you competing in wotlk tourney or are you casting?
[1:08:07] zelux05: did WW get any nerfs

[1:08:25] DaneDillon: Ven casting confirmed POG

[1:08:42] EricTheSwedishGuy: Any europeans here who know if I can drive in Canada on my EU drivers licence? Finally going to Canada for a week!!
[1:08:43] McLarge: You're "probably" not competing? That means you could potentially? Pog
[1:08:46] chili24: They're probably trying to crack down on RMT by banning gold over a certain cap via mail but that sounds like a stupid way to do it
[1:08:47] brewtank: @venruki you talk about the 40% hp buff yet?
[1:08:56] One0neOne: 101k hp wow
[1:09:02] moojerk: @moojerk Pog

[1:09:15] mikehaawk92: thats insane
[1:09:24] tv_raz: @Roxxybolts onretail too?
[1:09:28] McLarge: Nah, you know what they actually need to do? Just make gold infinitely easier to farm
[1:09:32] Roxxybolts: You can probably just remove me I don’t think I’ll be back tbh
[1:09:37] Roxxybolts: 6 months

[1:10:15] Roxxybolts: Well I only have one
[1:10:21] McLarge: Why wouldn't it work? If everyone has gold cap, who cares about buying gold LUL
[1:10:25] Tgibson2k7: Then they don't get their cut
[1:10:27] Locturnal_TV: we need a presidential pardon for all gold buyers
[1:10:34] egrounds: they banned you for 6 months, and didn't give you a reason @Roxxybolts
[1:10:36] Theo300: Should they just send everyone a 1400gold stimulus every month? Would that fix it?
[1:11:02] Roxxybolts: They said RMT @egrounds
[1:11:04] pSTOp: Stimcome
[1:11:07] moojerk: what race is that Ven?

[1:24:51] Nex210: i dont get why they didnt ditch all the showlands systems for prepatch. i cant be bothered learning old systems heading into dragonflight lol
[1:24:53] benoTTV: you would think they would have disabled covenants legendaries etc. so we can test properly
[1:24:55] wackpoetic: IDK why everyone is complaining,  I've been a Demo Lock main since earlier this week and it's ABOUT TIME we see some love

[1:29:26] vindy__: arcane mage just yea jazggzKEK
[1:29:32] akillabg: stuff n things
[1:30:13] Roxxybolts: BTW snutz bought the torch last night for 41k those boys milkeddddd him lol
[1:30:36] Feroxita1337: greater invis
[1:30:59] Lucons1: fire mage always has an advantage because of instant dmg
[1:30:59] McLarge: Fire didn't really need Slow
[1:31:02] Cvarks: think its arcane now w higher hp
[1:31:09] Cvarks: unless there is buffs ya
[1:31:16] benoTTV: if all specs do the same dmg, then we get to choose based on fantasy
[1:31:25] nightmxz: I think it still depends on the meta, if it's heavy shaman I think fire is #1 cuz instant damage
[1:31:30] Lucons1: yuh
[1:31:41] mskdboy: honestly the frost mage burst is the most scary with that glacial spikes
[1:31:53] Feroxita1337: maybe they will add pvp talents for each specc that will distinguish each specc COPIUM
[1:31:58] Castinnovas: 2 blocks on frost might be nice for survive
[1:32:03] zerozhr: as a healer i hope its fire, having caut is such a nice tool for gaging if i have to use cds or not
[1:32:04] Kulture1: @Feroxita1337 no
[1:32:09] MrDeadDorian: @venruki shift ?
[1:32:28] nameyourform: whatever spec does most damage will be best.....yeah that checks out
[1:32:41] Cvarks: maybe this new touch of the magi icon will throw people off MiniK
[1:32:55] divinease: Is notepad your "white board" for  discussions ven? :D :D :D
[1:33:04] vindy__: there's a new TotM icon whaaaaat @Cvarks
[1:33:10] Cvarks: @vindy__ its evanesse icon
[1:33:13] Cvarks: or whatever it was called
[1:33:13] Pherix1: my ray of frost bind was glacial spike
[1:33:14] Cvarks: from wod
[1:33:19] tinspoon: ive run out of keybinds, which is a great problem to have
[1:33:24] divinease: love it. Get's your thoughts out great :P
[1:33:26] Kulture1: venNotepad needs to be an emote
[1:33:26] vindy__: @Cvarks on beta?
[1:33:33] Cvarks: @vindy__ yep, mana gem fixed too
[1:33:37] mskdboy: @venruki  ice nova and glacial spike is almost always a huge crit
[1:34:03] vindy__: nice
[1:34:07] nightmxz: @Cvarks It was originally netherwind presence icon which gave haste...  but I'm an old man so don't mind me :)
[1:34:22] Cvarks: @nightmxz u see im so young idek what that is LOL
[1:34:40] danegod84: I have to say, I'm not a big fan of that. I like how wrath has different utility and play styles for each spec, rather than just which does the most damage or looks the coolest
[1:34:44] divinease: you do it often for sure
[1:34:45] Moobot: Latest video "This Could KILL Rated Solo Shuffle In Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/Ot5dDaFeieY
[1:34:46] Mj_N: I use ctrl binds with my palm it’s kinda nice
[1:34:48] egrounds: @venruki do you have my Discord?
[1:34:51] benoTTV: notepad is just a great app
[1:34:54] tinylittlemousie: :D
[1:34:57] nightmxz: @Cvarks talent in wrath & cata that gave 2% haste per point for arcane
[1:34:58] tokynwizard: in your naxx later are you doing normal fire or ffb build?
[1:35:04] light_of_heart: that little notepad lecture was basically a youtube vid
[1:35:19] Lucons1: fire is very good rn
[1:35:20] tokynwizard: i been digging ffb quite a bit
[1:35:23] JohnFGore: Québec
[1:35:24] egrounds: sent
[1:35:24] divinease: !discord
[1:35:25] vindy__: am i the only 1 salty that shatter got removed for fire/arcane? Arcane feels so limited on secondary stats especially, you just want everything(maybe except mastery jazggzOMEGAKEK )
[1:35:27] Lucons1: cuase of covenants
[1:35:28] Lucons1: only
[1:35:35] Kulture1: i want ven notepad lectures not about wow
[1:35:46] JohnFGore: queue
[1:36:00] nightmxz: Tbh now that they buffed health that much they should delete vers LOL
[1:36:01] Xo1o: we could predict future criticism: IMO people will not be OK with amount of keybinds and complexity of trees that doesn't match choices really @venruki
[1:36:16] nightmxz: Perfect time to normalize secondary stats between crit haste and mastery
[1:36:21] Felrane: my warlock does more damage not picking final talents lul
[1:36:29] mskdboy: some build based on the big casted  pyroblast
[1:36:33] kaayjay1: You know any good DH streamers that stream often?
[1:36:34] mskdboy: maybe could be cool
[1:36:42] Roxxybolts: my warlock does the most broken damage i've ever seen in my life
[1:36:50] Roxxybolts: and I am an army tank
[1:37:04] nameyourform: @Roxxybolts So broken that they banned you lulw
[1:37:05] Felrane: ya affliction aoe is bonkers right now
[1:37:08] elpolloloco278: need enhance shamy content :(
[1:37:12] lucasthebestx: frost mage in cata had deep freeze + imapct stun?
[1:37:14] Kulture1: i think theres an unnecessary pressure to get every active ability you can
[1:37:18] Roxxybolts: @nameyourform ^
[1:37:24] Mj_N: I like the change of pace with more stuff to press
[1:37:38] light_of_heart: Also when a lot of keybinds, individual buttons can't be doing too much damage so you have a lot of average buttons
[1:37:46] Khartax: @kaayjay1 Tren/Raiku(when he plays DH) and mvqq
[1:37:56] light_of_heart: maybe im wrong
[1:38:08] kaayjay1: @Khartax All 3 of them stream so seldom
[1:38:08] benoTTV: I wonder why
[1:38:13] Roxxybolts: hmmmmm
[1:38:33] Khartax: @kaayjay1 Im sure from 3 streamers u can rotate/see enough
[1:38:35] zemm8582: thoughts on the massive hp increase in df?
[1:38:49] Feroxita1337: i cant wait to see how the meta will evolve
[1:38:50] benoTTV: big nerf to burst classes
[1:38:51] Felrane: I am hoping they release wow on consoles. Id love to just daily farm with my feet up on the big screen
[1:38:58] Wracrz: as frost i have so many keybinds
[1:39:02] croivan18: no i have the same problem
[1:39:04] Wracrz: not so much fire
[1:39:04] ekologiisk: one more bind and im out
[1:39:06] ekologiisk: no more space
[1:39:07] benoTTV: yea I just take passive talents and call it a day
[1:39:09] christiancbs: are covs and legs still enabled in arena?
[1:39:10] nightmxz: I'm dropping mirror images, for the aoe slow passive LMAO
[1:39:10] light_of_heart: time to bind N
[1:39:15] nightmxz: for arcane anyway
[1:39:16] divinease: okay ven bring out the big excel layout of your keybinds to show us big picture of all your keybinds O_o
[1:39:19] KassixTV: Definitely had to invent some new keybinds for dragonflight...
[1:39:25] Khartax: Get an mmo mouse @venruki
[1:39:26] Xo1o: big time, I had to use a new modifiert on my mouse
[1:39:31] explicite_7: mop druid keybinds Aware
[1:39:53] Feroxita1337: its good because its intant and has no cd
[1:39:54] ekologiisk: its good if u wanna slow w/o doing damage first
[1:40:06] Sosatko: I'd like casting to bea  thing again in retail but it wont be
[1:40:12] Lucons1: !addons
[1:40:12] Moobot: @arksyde1 Details, SArena, Omnibar, OmniCD, Big Debuffs, Weak Auras, RaiderIO addon
[1:40:14] Sosatko: less casting = better
[1:40:20] egrounds: sent you the deets @venruki for disc.

[1:40:45] ovidiucristian: i made pizza for brealfast

[1:42:30] walokki: in pvp
[1:42:40] Jayphotic: I saw fire is topping arcane now in wrath top percentile
[1:42:45] Mj_N: Whatcha think of dps casters (mana) should go oom like classic maybe they do a bit more dmg?
[1:42:46] Holloweven: i miss the old one

[1:49:10] murlu17: tank solo shuffle is like having to take your incredibly annoying and loud little brother to your friends hang out because your parents don't want to deal with them

[1:51:42] AzinoTV: who are u cheering for in the world cup?

[1:52:24] kingkind: Fuck fire, i wouldnt mind if that spec was completely removed im sick of it LUL
[1:52:24] noxheart: they should honestly just have made mages in DF like in mop and it would be gucci. especially fire

[1:59:36] NoCulturex: here is a fix
[1:59:39] zombieDolfin: Jesus.. gdruids need to be banned from arena
[1:59:41] Fixit_cat: We're definitely going to be in the youtube video
[1:59:42] NoCulturex: lets all play tanks
[1:59:45] Mosholol: how is this guy even in the game with u i don't get it
[1:59:47] rekt1370: bear tank immune to everything in the game for 30 seconds KEKW
[1:59:48] Skullomat: what is this? people switching teams 2/6 rounds
[1:59:50] LuxMores: Sounds like a skill issue GIGACHAD
[1:59:53] itsnotkt: STOP CRYING AND JUST PLAY
[1:59:57] kingkind: Fast games though… LUL
[1:59:58] Jimmypop8: sounds like LoL
[1:59:59] zombieDolfin: Overwatch GOATS meta coming to WoW?
[2:00:04] Kalakbar: PepeS
[2:00:06] Emerno: Chatting
[2:00:10] itsnotkt: LOL
[2:00:16] ekologiisk: there should be a box where u check if u wanna face tanks or nt
[2:00:24] kreyzy8: this looks like so much fun :)
[2:00:25] nightmxz: have your tank stand in a corner and ice wall him in so he lives LMAO
[2:00:25] TigerStormrage: hiiii ven :3 It's Betrayer in your game~
[2:00:31] BigOuch: This is a clear problem, is it going to get addressed?
[2:00:40] Sosatko: ur a mage without a rogue
[2:00:42] roarrrr: i think tanks should be viable but now how they are, Everything should do damage and everything should die.
[2:00:42] Sosatko: ofc kekw
[2:00:45] Skullomat: is this the famous solo queue people talked so much about?
[2:00:47] tinspoon: how do you feel on your windwalker in solo shuffle?
[2:00:48] Lucons1: @ekologiisk worst idea ive heard ngl
[2:00:54] NoCulturex: if this is the new wow meta .... sorry but no tanks let the game just die in peace :D
[2:01:07] Fixit_cat: This is solo shuffle's evil twin. This isn't real solo shuffle
[2:01:18] itsnotkt: its a video game, no video game really matters
[2:01:19] Locturnal_TV: p much how my first time back to retail was. Tried out rated solo que, sat 10 min ques to que into 2x guardian druid. Alt f4d
[2:01:21] Smexxin: tank slayer Pog
[2:01:25] 3mirrors: i dont want to be discouraged but im discouraged
[2:01:40] Jeepleet: why does the game end after 1 person is dies
[2:01:48] Kalakbar: IT'S HIS CHOICE
[2:01:52] kingkind: WHY IS THIS DK EVEN QUEUEING LUL
[2:01:54] sum_x: dog shit blood dk, no offence :)
[2:02:00] esotericxs: Maybe the guardian druid is just a really good player
[2:02:00] BigOuch: Why does Blizzard fail us so hard?
[2:02:03] Raxica: sounds balanced to me
[2:02:07] ekologiisk: @arksyde1  why so?  then u can play with tanks if u want and those u dont can have fun
[2:02:14] ekologiisk: that or just remove them from pvp
[2:02:17] Emerno: died before Malgo KEKL
[2:02:18] efpsychi: nice game
[2:02:19] TigerStormrage: this is rough lmao
[2:02:28] Borngood: tank vs healer solo shuffle isnt even the same game mode, the disparity is crazy
[2:02:34] NoCulturex: sound like a you problem
[2:02:34] Borngood: should be seperate
[2:02:49] Lucons1: @ekologiisk might as well remove them then cause everyone is gonna press that box, give them a seperate bracket
[2:02:51] StromicusRex: you sound really bitter ven Kapp
[2:02:52] kreyzy8: it just shouldn't even be an option
[2:02:52] thatsinsanoflex: the sarcasm is hilarious!!!
[2:02:54] looongstory: sounds like its time to go back to wrath
[2:02:58] rilsolo: just have them take 65% more damage or something
[2:03:02] trobknight7: can they just disable tank for solo shuffle?
[2:03:04] esotericxs: just put all tanks in one queue and they can play tanks 3v3
[2:03:09] gamernick410: do you think malgo is having fun?
[2:03:09] rekt1370: KEKW
[2:03:10] extra_dizzy: Tanks and healers should be in the same games
[2:03:12] havefunguy333: yeah that is BS
[2:03:14] kreyzy8: holy fuck KEKW
[2:03:18] kingkind: Some would argue that warlocks are dps and they are tankier than most tanks LUL
[2:03:23] TigerStormrage: he outdamaged me :)
[2:03:30] ekologiisk: @arksyde1  i actually dont care if they go in the bin, so im ok with that
[2:03:30] Kalakbar: he did as much as 2, 3, and 4 together
[2:03:30] TurtleHoptv: damn i rerolling guardian druid
[2:03:35] Locturnal_TV: all solo q r1 spots are going to be held by guardian druids. :)
[2:03:35] 3mirrors: i dont want to be one of those guys but...this makes me not want to play :)
[2:03:43] efpsychi: so excited for SoloQ in DF!
[2:03:50] Lucons1: @ekologiisk im saying blizzard cant do that which is why its a bad idea
[2:04:04] pix5l: @Locturnal_TV r1 titles will be spec specific, however awful tanks in pvp are
[2:04:05] Kalakbar: one of the nice things about playing as a healer is you don't see tanks often
[2:04:06] asmit8: @venruki would you say this is a guardian issue or an overall issue, because blood seemed awful
[2:04:08] kreyzy8: solo shuffle gonna become a tank haven monkaW
[2:04:08] sy10xx: people always leaving ;(
[2:04:15] Lucons1: yup
[2:04:18] roarrrr: yessss balance tnaks please
[2:04:19] sum_x: why is a tank in the healing role even possible
[2:04:19] ekologiisk: @arksyde1  i see
[2:04:21] Locturnal_TV: oh thats cool @pix5l saving grace
[2:04:26] kreyzy8: they can't even balance tanks in pve :D
[2:04:26] mutual: !settings
[2:04:28] KassixTV: No they shouldn't be in a healer role
[2:04:40] Fixit_cat: 30 SECONDS? Monkawhat
[2:04:44] tinspoon: true
[2:04:45] Zlaitorn: What addon do you use for arena Ven?
[2:04:45] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:04:54] Emerno: i cant believe guardian is still like this without aligners
[2:04:54] Crocfacex: Hey Ven, do you have any idea what it cost to level 1-450 ENGI in WOTLK gold wise?
[2:04:55] benoTTV: pvp is a complete afterthought in this game
[2:04:57] Kalakbar: yeah it was a massive issue in rbgs too
[2:05:01] Axtin: itll be 10 sec in dragonflight but its still ridiculous
[2:05:01] squek22: Ven! I was the boomy you were just with, So happy after queueing with you :)
[2:05:15] Lucons1: Legion guardian druid :c
[2:05:18] Zieth: I guess the easiest answer is straight up tuning, I was gonna suggest PvP talents that do % hp dmg
[2:05:22] TigerStormrage: The tanks and no leaver penalty is rough, had 9 games in a row before that last one where people just kept leaving.
[2:05:27] nightmxz: Oh yeah have you tried the new arcane barrage yet? they changed the animation again
[2:05:32] itsnotkt: they have 2 grips not 10k grips
[2:05:34] itsnotkt: stop
[2:05:41] PackyouabowlTV: Solution: add solo que to wrath classic
[2:05:44] Axtin: if legendaries/covs were disabled these guardian druids would be waaaaay less powerful
[2:05:58] ciderbyte: Blizzard cares about raiding world first and not much else. Feels bad.
[2:06:28] gosuhaxbuild: Chatting
[2:06:40] Kulture1: i don't think they "want" tanks in pvp, they just don't want players to feel left out or left behind
[2:06:43] Smexxin: prepatch balance is just whacky atm, lot of systems that are gonna be gone soon
[2:06:52] NoCulturex: copium
[2:06:55] Axtin: yea prot pala just has the most insane group utility and it hasnt changed since legion
[2:06:59] MagePowa: @venruki Blizzard employes are bling? they havent players? it is incomprehensible. "one old solid gamer can fix this game for one day"..
[2:07:09] esotericxs: Surely they will have it fixed for DF, suuuuurely
[2:07:14] Lucons1: it is though, not the same at all on beta
[2:07:15] Hogmanlolz: a lot of ven's sentiment was based on the last entire expansion though
[2:07:27] misdota: they should 100% just put a system where you can vote to deny the match, and if like
[2:07:29] Hogmanlolz: everything he said about guardian/prot paladin/brewmaster was completely accurate
[2:07:30] misdota: 4/6 people do it, you requeue
[2:07:33] nameyourform: can u make a tweet about that tank shit i want blizz to see it
[2:07:35] benoTTV: you can accept the queue and as soon as you see a tank on the join screen you can logout
[2:07:39] misdota: so you don't get 4x warlocks and 2 guardian druids
[2:07:39] Mosholol: prot pala is busted in pvp just cause the paladin has a great toolkit in general while brewmaster not really
[2:07:42] sum_x: @misdota or just dont let tanks be in the healer role LUL
[2:07:42] TigerStormrage: tanks make it unplayable, esp when you fight guardian with lego + covenant and all that in prepatch versus like...blood dk, or veng dh. Like how do you win that?
[2:07:58] TigerStormrage: I was Betrayer in your last game
[2:08:00] TigerStormrage: the DH
[2:08:07] TigerStormrage: That DK did absolutely nothing to live
[2:08:09] Kalakbar: Brew isn't a good tank tho in pvp
[2:08:10] eyeothis: just bann tanks in solo shuffle?
[2:08:13] TigerStormrage: and the guardian was like
[2:08:17] Fixit_cat: You either die a hero or live long enough to be the brewmaster
[2:08:17] Axtin: brewmaster looks so useless
[2:08:18] sum_x: @TigerStormrage he was like 220 ilvl
[2:08:18] TigerStormrage: 'not my problem" lmfao like yes it is
[2:08:27] TigerStormrage: @sumoboi24 dude he did nothing lmfao it was so bad
[2:08:27] misdota: @sumoboi24 the problem is it's not just tanks, you get absolutely stupid unfun comps. I played a game with literally 4 aff locks the other day. solo queue will just be hte most op class queueing and climbing
[2:08:29] esotericxs: I was the guardian druid, ggs was fun
[2:08:38] TigerStormrage: @esotericxs YOU?! >.>
[2:08:53] goatyoga420: yo ven what time your classic raid at ?
[2:09:02] StromicusRex: need a rukiPaint emote too
[2:09:07] sum_x: @misdota well its pre-patch with double legos double covenants, ofc balance is way off
[2:09:22] Fixit_cat: Bob Rossruki
[2:09:32] ciderbyte: Blizzard has only done pve tuning at the point and frost mage has yet to be included in even that. I would avoid playing the spec at this point.
[2:09:39] misdota: well I think there will be something completely broken in season 1 of dflight, as always, and it will be the same story. not just a prepatch thing to me, the solo queue class presence
[2:09:48] divinease: OMG BRINGING out the big guns with PAINT
[2:09:57] creecraw: @venruki hey buddy. i've been away since beginning of SLs. came back and I'm really concerned about playing any caster this expansion. thoughts?
[2:10:01] divinease: perfect way to explain :D
[2:10:14] WormBite: Giving me ptsd from the 12 second DH flag caps on the gilnean ctf map
[2:10:16] FrostAlive: Are you excited about the PVP gear changes? Basically no more grind to upgrade PVP gear
[2:10:19] Hogmanlolz: probs the way the monk roll was created works off movement speed in some capacity where as another designer just made point + click at x range for vengeance
[2:10:20] thatsinsanoflex: you remember when DH could get on the roof of the buildings in twin peaks?
[2:10:21] Hogmanlolz: if i had to guess
[2:10:24] Borngood: I just wish we had a testable version of the game to give good feedback
[2:10:33] Borngood: beta and pre patch are unplayable
[2:10:36] Borngood: for arena
[2:10:55] Chancec29: tanks lol
[2:11:03] TigerStormrage: tanks, sadge
[2:11:03] kreyzy8: more tanks Pog
[2:11:03] sy10xx: you always get the tank games xD
[2:11:07] qkmood: KEKW
[2:11:11] Lucons1: ur actually cursed
[2:11:12] Emerno: 3 tanks in a row LUL
[2:11:15] sy10xx: @FrostAlive how does it work?
[2:11:18] Wracrz: wonder if kyrian frost works in solo shuffle
[2:11:24] thisisthotcaller: huh i think i was about to queue with you
[2:11:25] kingkind: POG TANKS MY FAVORITE
[2:11:26] thisisthotcaller: not as a tank
[2:11:27] Axtin: i wish blizz would at least say why they kept covs/legos enabled instead of being silent
[2:11:31] MagePowa: @venruki Blizzard employes are bling? employers are vegetable seller? they havent players? it is incomprehensible. "one old solid gamer can fix this game for one day"..
[2:11:34] creecraw: @venruki hey buddy. i've been away since beginning of SLs. came back and I'm really concerned about playing any caster this expansion. thoughts?
[2:11:35] FrostAlive: Just where in instanced pvp, your pvp gear will be max ilvl
[2:11:35] Trigg82: @FrostAlive Where can I read about this?
[2:11:38] nightmxz: You should checkout the new barrage animation and compare it with wrath, you can  actually feel the damage difference in the animations
[2:11:50] Fixit_cat: I dig it
[2:11:50] Skullomat: lol what a nerd
[2:11:51] anomieballad: that's tubular
[2:11:51] Emerno: Magic Missile! Pog
[2:11:54] Lucons1: what a titan
[2:11:55] WormBite: Powerful
[2:11:56] law4d93: kinda looks like your holding a really big ...
[2:11:56] INnoV: everyone will eventually sound like Joefernandes if tanks are viable in solo
[2:11:57] rtee1__: thoughs on arcane for df? any change for competive play?
[2:11:57] esotericxs: you can circumvent the queue by disconnecting yourself on another client when queue pops and you see theres a tank, but the fact that you even need to do that to play the game is dumb
[2:12:01] roboltz: Nerd
[2:12:11] kingkind: Posture LUL
[2:12:15] law4d93: hahahaa
[2:12:19] looongstory: what a hunk
[2:12:19] tahmuu: i'd want to be his friend
[2:12:20] Ledo92: is it worth coming back  to prepatch retail or wait till after dragonflight
[2:12:21] DraayNaation: @venruki thats near me! I should of joined ya lmao
[2:12:22] zelux05: ladies love when chads cast spells
[2:12:22] Danoob85: he is having a good time
[2:12:22] Kalakbar: "Hansol is so hot right now"
[2:12:22] Fixit_cat: Does it look like a fishing pole? maybe you can play it off as that
[2:12:26] law4d93: id think theres a virgin
[2:12:45] rtee1__: thoughs on arcane for df? any chance for competive play?
[2:12:48] PARCHIII: id think that guys just like me... a gamer
[2:12:54] Ty_Currency: 32? Young wizard
[2:12:56] looongstory: if i saw a man casting spells i would ask to be his apprentice
[2:12:58] supersix16: Id ask him to conjure food for me
[2:13:02] BigOuch: Is this live or beta?
[2:13:15] tahmuu: why cant they just.. put all tanks together in a tank-only brawl
[2:13:37] Zieth: @venruki Is it just tuning?
[2:13:52] looongstory: yeah they should tune guardian dmg in half
[2:13:57] Borngood: I think the fact that there are more tank q pops then healers should be a worrying indication.
[2:14:12] rtee1__: prot warriors one shotting u isnt fun either
[2:14:18] Zieth: Let healers do top damage and not be able to be CC'd and they'd queue more
[2:14:19] timnology: im getting insanely tired of people leaving on game 5 lol
[2:14:27] Felrane: healing sucks in most pvp situations for the average player is likely why
[2:14:29] Bigvuqoffdam: ive never qd into a tank in solo shuffle...must not be a problem! Kappa
[2:14:41] mlckln: this one stream stopped me from buying DF, thank you!
[2:14:51] donotcrit: They put 0.5 intern into designing tank pvp
[2:14:52] rtee1__: what if , 3's only dps? u would like it?
[2:14:54] nightmxz: just queue brewmaster and embrace the torture
[2:14:59] leeka: i almost want to play a healer now because of the tanks
[2:15:00] Felrane: Prepatch isn't dragonflight
[2:15:07] roboltz: Oh that’s why I’ve never gotten tanks as a healer lol in solo q
[2:15:09] hugoboss_: #sponsored
[2:15:13] hugoboss_: Kappa
[2:15:21] Corndogman: What class seems the best for solo shuffle so far?
[2:15:23] roboltz: I thought I’ve just been getting lucky
[2:15:23] itsnotkt: game is not rushed
[2:15:25] Felrane: Just like shadowlands riparoni
[2:15:33] looongstory: name a wow expansion that wasnt rushed on release ill wait
[2:15:34] khrude_x: every game is always rush stg
[2:15:43] imyoungdraco: they only had 3 patches in shadowlands how are they so behind lol
[2:15:46] Rancor36: if they rush out the game and everyone hates it everyone is gonna quit and nobody is gonna wanna play it when its good
[2:15:47] dassant: the game is rushed since wod
[2:15:49] itsnotkt: the team is spead out working on wotlk which is useless
[2:15:54] Bigvuqoffdam: need high Q4 stonks!!
[2:15:55] Probab1e: It's wild they keep doing that with every release, just wait longer, fuck, if you need it to be 3rd quarter release, wait a year I don't care
[2:16:03] jjop810: Most games now days are rushed IMO.
[2:16:07] Felrane: BC/Wrath/MoP/Legion/BFA i guess were not rushed
[2:16:21] Emerno: 5Head
[2:16:22] imyoungdraco: 9 month long seasons and still behind on the next xpac
[2:16:23] artirie: I find it so weird that they rushed it too.  Like they gave us Wrath, they could've let that keep us busy for a bit.  I'm all for new content, but like everyone, I want it to be amazing
[2:16:38] donotcrit: if they don’t release anything nobody will play anyway
[2:16:39] fovven: how the game is now isnt how its going to be at 70 either
[2:16:40] asmit8: it was a corporate decision, not gameplay
[2:16:46] creecraw: @venruki different question. best melee between rogue, war, ww?
[2:16:50] NoCulturex: yes
[2:16:52] playerwhat: @venruki  you know if we will get new pvp mode or experiments with pvp?
[2:16:52] Lucons1: that might be me
[2:16:52] NoCulturex: tru
[2:16:53] forsaken_: DF is too basic to fail tho, no torghast, no covenants no maw
[2:16:54] NoCulturex: i ca
[2:16:57] storm_chaser_ron: yeah but they aren't going anywhere
[2:16:59] Felrane: well ya gearing to fast. content to easy in phase 1 wrath
[2:16:59] kornonfire: Doesn't help that wrath is sort of a solved game
[2:17:02] malta_tv: Can you show talents?
[2:17:03] chili24: People that want the new patch in wotlk right now are dumb
[2:17:04] divinease: youre not wrong at people wanting more, they are leveling 3-4 alts ....
[2:17:06] BigWumbology: Its not ADHD its just that the thing to do now is rush content
[2:17:09] storm_chaser_ron: @kornonfire ^^^^
[2:17:17] donotcrit: no matter how good the patch is there is no way people enjoy it more than 3 months
[2:17:26] DrkPhoenix6913: when you clear the raid on day 1... yeah of course classic is going to have nothing to do :P
[2:17:26] kingkind: We were simpler gentlemen back then
[2:17:33] Lucons1: @chili24 dont worry the patch is staying the same the whole expansion lul
[2:17:38] PackyouabowlTV: You are right I’m almost bored enough of wrath to hop on retail again soon
[2:17:44] Trigg82: Not surprised people are bored with Wrath was done with 14 years ago...
[2:17:45] divinease: I just want to find good players to play arena's with regularly.
[2:17:55] mskdboy: lol
[2:17:57] Strife24821: lol
[2:18:04] mskdboy: LUL LUL
[2:18:11] kingkind: FUCK
[2:18:11] Enejj: tanks dont belong in a ranked environment
[2:18:12] im_capy: been seeing a lot of tanks today?
[2:18:13] rtee1__: @divinease thats the classic dredge someone with pacience
[2:18:13] storm_chaser_ron: have they disabled covenants yet
[2:18:15] Smexxin: maybe its time to become a healer so you always have one :O :O
[2:18:16] im_capy: nm you just answered LUL
[2:18:16] hugoboss_: jokes on you, he wont heal u
[2:18:17] kingkind: NO TANKS?? DansGame DansGame
[2:18:17] TigerStormrage: guardian makes solo so miserable
[2:18:37] tahmuu: yes
[2:18:38] Borngood: dont do it youll hate yourself
[2:18:38] timnology: yeeeees
[2:18:40] Borngood: not fun
[2:18:42] jjop810: Yes
[2:18:46] Lucons1: i heard theyre making a mage healer in DF
[2:18:53] asmit8: could you try fiskweaving on nunruki?
[2:18:54] Kulture1: healing sucks
[2:18:56] donotcrit: healing in solo shuffle isn’t that fun actually
[2:18:56] divinease: If you go as healer you'll see why no one wants to heal anymore lmao
[2:18:59] Axtin: healers never have to face tanks and get insta qs, must be nice
[2:19:06] UsedxxUp: You'll que as healed and it will be like a dungeon group. 1 tank,1 dps, 1 heal
[2:19:23] mskdboy: healing is for gigaminds that loves being stressed. otherwise unplayable
[2:19:27] j4NZKUE: Who came up with not removing legendaries and covenants in prepatch :D
[2:19:49] hugoboss_: it was me :)
[2:20:54] mskdboy: @axtin  trust me there are problem in heaven too. when pple line u for no reason and get killed the tilting level is very very high
[2:21:09] fruitvendorx: So arcane is the only good mage spec, huh?
[2:21:11] Borngood: actually def try some MW games I want to see what you think
[2:21:16] creecraw: @venruki wasn't the beginning of shadowlands like thsi for mage?
[2:21:23] SPENCERGUH: huge burst -5% hp LUL
[2:21:26] Meeksio: is MW monk fun? I haven't played it since MoP but I enjoyed punching things to heal
[2:21:28] snitchedz: at least looks like theres not much change from wotlk to this damage numbers look same
[2:21:36] hugoboss_: dks have alot of surviveability but thats only because they have no mobility @venruki
[2:21:41] Borngood: im more curious the fun factor over winning.
[2:21:46] mskdboy: go healer
[2:21:49] hugoboss_: Kappa
[2:21:53] Borngood: he's trolling
[2:21:56] Bigvuqoffdam: dk has the best mobility ingame
[2:21:58] mskdboy: kill shaman SeemsGood PixelBob
[2:22:26] Emerno: fire mage Chatting
[2:22:29] Kalakbar: IMAGINE BEING A WIZARD COMPLAINING ABOUT ANYTHING
[2:22:29] law4d93: hahahahaha
[2:22:31] timnology: that lock has just absorbed your entire opener lol wth
[2:22:37] Vanisaris: but mages!
[2:22:38] Kulture1: yea but mages are op ven
[2:22:41] TigerStormrage: people say the same about DH, cause I have fun with havoc. :) doesn't change that tanks are miserable to play against
[2:22:54] tedthezodiaccruz_: Make Mages Subpar again
[2:23:20] 3mirrors: you really just dont get it, us tanks are making your queue times faster Kappa
[2:23:57] palakekw: is this beta?
[2:24:00] noxheart: i feel like mage is one of those classes that changed so fucking much in how they play and what they do since back in the day
[2:24:10] tjzlock: adding more hp will surely fix it
[2:24:13] mskdboy: just do 3 tanks Vs 3 tanks ? @venruki  new idea
[2:24:13] Whalechill: you can restart duels lol
[2:24:13] kindameh: thugbear in awc was pretty funny tho
[2:24:15] Axtin: crazy how ive done like 10 solo shuffles today and havent seen a single ww or enh, people just wanna play the most broken shit only
[2:24:29] BigOuch: how do duels look?
[2:24:30] kingkind: @venruki blastwave into icewall seems like a play..
[2:24:34] donotcrit: maybe it has something to do with you being on bottom damage?
[2:24:38] storm_chaser_ron: wait what happened to enh
[2:24:38] playerwhat: i think if tank would be well made like a support class in lol, and everyone designed in dat way, have tank healr woul be cool but probably to skilled to play
[2:24:42] Axtin: yea but they can still do just fine
[2:24:44] Lucons1: @noxheart its because of mobility changes
[2:24:45] Kulture1: what were enh changes?
[2:24:46] Kalakbar: yeah Enhancement got a bad nerf, 25% to everything
[2:24:54] 3mirrors: @Kulture1 literally a 25% nerf
[2:24:55] Kulture1: wtf
[2:24:57] mskdboy: make tanks face only other tanks in only tanks bracket kekbye
[2:25:00] Kulture1: thats insane
[2:25:00] jgagel1: this seemed flat?
[2:25:03] mskdboy: 1 hour matches
[2:25:06] mikzflocka: DH and Lock just need a nerf as well. DH needs a really big nerf.
[2:25:07] 3mirrors: that's it, nothing else. straight up 25% nerf to all damage KEKW
[2:25:26] rtee1__: why such a big nerf?
[2:25:36] antebanzies: ooooo DF pvp
[2:25:42] storm_chaser_ron: @storm_chaser_ron wtf
[2:25:47] gryff_28: it just seems super lazy
[2:25:50] palakekw: it's lazy balancing. Easiest for them to just do that
[2:26:20] tedthezodiaccruz_: enhancement must scale well then? hopefully? lol
[2:26:38] Vethosis: @Rearwind still does 50% of ur hp now LUL
[2:26:50] rudeeboi: yea df is def ResidentSleeper
[2:26:52] mskdboy: @rearwind  but let's buff a bit more ele blast in the next uptade and we are set SeemsGood Kappa
[2:27:13] minno_09: lock was already nerfed they hotfixed sweet souls and dark pact
[2:27:16] mskdboy: @rearwind  no kappa they will do that prob lol
[2:27:31] ondoxx: is there a com option in solo q with mics?
[2:27:41] Lucons1: @minno_09 could u link that please
[2:27:50] GoatOnDrugz: is the new bg good?
[2:28:02] storm_chaser_ron: @Rearwind i played for an afternoon and lava lash was pumpin, but the rest seemed totally fine
[2:28:02] UbbzyBoi: after playing wrath you realize there isnt that many blanket silences in the game anymore but like 500 more stuns or micro ccs
[2:28:03] antebanzies: you have a cool ass llama mount tho
[2:28:09] minno_09: I don't have a link the tooltip changed in game over night
[2:28:19] thisisthotcaller: do you think DK is S tier?
[2:28:32] antebanzies: can army of the dead in arenas now?
[2:28:41] looongstory: is it the effects in the kits or just numbers that make classes S tier
[2:29:08] minno_09: sweet souls was allowing you to benefit from your own healthstone so it was double healing. and dark pact w/ 15sec reduced CD was providing a shield 500% of health sacrified now it is only 300%
[2:29:23] mikzflocka: @minno_09 "Only 300%"
[2:29:41] Khartax: Any reason to play prepatch over beta atm ?
[2:29:52] Lucons1: ty sir
[2:29:53] BigOuch: Does not look fun
[2:29:55] minno_09: 300% of 20% sacrified health = 60% health and you're saccing 20%
[2:30:02] minno_09: its not that crazy tbh people break my shield in like 3 seconds man
[2:30:10] byrdyyy777: i got ur back ven via lock
[2:30:11] minno_09: do more dmg
[2:30:22] 3mirrors: honestly i would avoid prepatch and beta and just wait for DF
[2:30:28] thisisthotcaller: do you think DK is actually S tier?
[2:30:50] UbbzyBoi: @3mirrors just play wrath till it drops, everything is borked atm
[2:30:52] laito_: aren't dj
[2:30:53] Lucons1: lmao
[2:30:59] ciderbyte: What’s more sad is this is the dame with Lonely Winter. RIP Water Ele.
[2:31:05] ciderbyte: Damage*

[2:33:16] Kalakbar: like Galadriel, I have a tempest inside of me
[2:33:25] BigOuch: I hate monks
[2:33:26] Meeksio: I will say I'm looking forward to next expansion because it will be alt friendly. Not having to worry about covenants, soulbinds, legendaries on every character. Just being able to gear out every healer will be fun for once
[2:33:27] tinspoon: How is windwalker in Solos?
[2:33:33] Kalakbar: in layman's terms, I should poop
[2:33:35] asmit8: fissssst weeeeaverrrrrrr pl0x
[2:33:38] storm_chaser_ron: someone give kal a time out, the spice is out of control
[2:33:46] storm_chaser_ron: i expect this from stromicus not kal
[2:33:46] Zlaitorn: Yo Ven, can you please share youre interface code, would be big dam
[2:33:53] BigOuch: I like Mage, Lock, Spriest, Ele
[2:33:56] ca11um3004: Mystical has a build on his YouTube

[2:34:04] Jimmypop8: Felt like too many abilitys
[2:34:12] Borngood: I see some MW talents we like this

[2:34:17] StromicusRex: @storm_chaser_ron rude

[2:36:56] CoffeeCupsTV: nah. i like moving short distances. more controlled
[2:37:04] byrdyyy777: doesnt mw have like 4 knocks now?
[2:37:28] CoffeeCupsTV: the big thing is the PVP tallent, its the one where you get to nock the enemy into the air behind you.
[2:37:34] nnumbing: did you cross the border to buy a powerball ticket yet? XD
[2:37:45] byrdyyy777: kinda like brewmasters upkick thing?
[2:38:01] CoffeeCupsTV: exactly
[2:38:36] vibesham: Get revival instead of restoral
[2:38:39] ca11um3004: It’s in the description of this video - https://youtu.be/YYJgPgcd6HU
[2:38:47] CoffeeCupsTV: Restoral can be used in stuns though.
[2:38:53] CoffeeCupsTV: you want restoral
[2:39:02] Fixit_cat: you dont have to worry about tanks anymore. just newbie dps lol
[2:39:02] vibesham: magic immunity is so much stronger
[2:39:25] CoffeeCupsTV: both get that
[2:39:34] skottys: hey @venruki what are your keybinds for targeting? thanks in advance ❤️
[2:39:35] demusical6: how do u guys reomve the dragon bar
[2:39:45] CoffeeCupsTV: Restoral can get magic imunity
[2:41:29] Zamix1: hows the stamina change
[2:41:32] nnumbing: lock doesnt need your healing hes good
[2:41:33] Bigvuqoffdam: DH doing 30kdps alongside his 17 covenants
[2:41:40] CoffeeCupsTV: you get a kick now!
[2:41:41] ciderbyte: DH are broken btw
[2:41:44] ciderbyte: Have fun
[2:41:45] Feroxita1337: the stamina change is not on live servers right
[2:41:56] mikzflocka: Why are people cheesing with broken classes in pre-patch+
[2:41:58] Emerno: @Feroxita1337 nope
[2:42:12] mementhusiast: You forgot the big dam judge
[2:42:28] its_doms: wow
[2:42:35] SokoLdOOb: just DH thing xD
[2:42:36] its_doms: wtf
[2:42:42] storm_chaser_ron: gamer
[2:42:43] its_doms: that's gross
[2:42:44] leeka: they are abusing that throw glaive damage
[2:42:45] fovven: the dh throw glaive dot does insane damage
[2:42:46] itsnotkt: ability do dmaage now out side of cooldowns
[2:42:47] bllazzin: healing looks fun...
[2:42:50] Crookz_ED: soulrend build lol
[2:42:52] rtee1__: wow right now, everyone has crazy dps
[2:42:54] CoffeeCupsTV: DHs dot is massive broken right now
[2:42:59] Kalakbar: ooooh, is that bugged right now?
[2:43:06] itsnotkt: ability do dmaage now out side of cooldowns isnt this what u wanted
[2:43:25] leeka: throw glaive dot just does crazy damage or something
[2:43:26] ciderbyte: *Everyone but frost mage
[2:43:53] WashedUpHasBeen: it's cause of unintended legendary interaction
[2:44:33] WashedUpHasBeen: it's the dh dots, not warlock
[2:44:34] ciderbyte: How can it be unintended when Blizzard intentionally didn’t disable them?
[2:44:39] wolfgank41: yup..
[2:44:52] wolfgank41: two dots and I'm dying
[2:44:52] zyn0h: i feel like WW has more buttons than any other class
[2:45:05] rtee1__: @ZinEssenceX resto shamy maybe
[2:45:34] Kalakbar: rdruid
[2:46:15] pulsch: uh oh venmwuki is BACK
[2:46:50] benoTTV: if you add mage portal to your action bar and press the button is it working? mine does nothing
[2:47:07] 3mirrors: mistruki the master of emerald dragons
[2:47:08] maini: I wish they just went ahead and removed the covenant abilities cause decimating bolt into incinerates are nuts.
[2:47:14] mazcortv: bruh that is so annoying
[2:47:23] mazcortv: solo q is so stupid
[2:47:23] psychic2423: no points for effort
[2:47:29] Kalakbar: yeah, pretty dumb
[2:47:35] warriorlynx22: que cabron!!!
[2:47:39] Zamix1: so the highest rated solo que is gonna be like Ven, cdew, mes, pikaboo, xaryu, etc all swapping around Pog
[2:47:45] zombieDolfin: they need to fix that asap.. otherwise solo shuffle is dead on arrival.
[2:47:45] peten02: !bis
[2:47:45] Nightbot: Here is my fire mage bis https://eightyupgrades.com/set/oaGoGkohZfeCugrXsdk3rj  - Here is my frost mage bis: https://eightyupgrades.com/set/5qf5euCXk7eb3NzetJnjui
[2:47:59] Emerno: @Zamix1 none of those are guardian druid, so probably wrong :P
[2:48:00] Feroxita1337: i assume people currently dont care because its just the SL post season but when dragonflight s1 starts people wont leave that much
[2:48:01] UbbzyBoi: I think the best thing they did for this system is making each spec have its own rating, rather than having to tank your main spec to learn a different one
[2:48:36] gregl__: raid reasons
[2:48:36] zyn0h: castavle why stunned
[2:48:42] wolfgank41: ven how are mages  in prepatch?
[2:48:43] gregl__: is why it exists
[2:49:01] mementhusiast: Bring back mistwalk, you remember that talent?
[2:49:33] tinspoon: if fistweaving comes back, theyll be the coolest
[2:49:41] pulsch: play mighty ox kick its omegalul
[2:49:41] Zamix1: damn thats like 2x what i have for SP
[2:49:42] WashedUpHasBeen: hpal talents look pretty good
[2:49:52] zyn0h: yeah but Nobody wants fistweaving back
[2:50:06] itsnotkt: ability do dmaage now out side of cooldowns, isnt this what u wanted
[2:50:09] trixsta_: @venruki as someone torn between evoker and ww for df how bad were the nerfs?
[2:50:14] Jimmypop8: mystical said it wasnt good
[2:50:16] donotcrit: frost mage has like 2 pvp talents
[2:50:30] zyn0h: if im playing a healer, i wwant to heal, not run in and try to do damage and risk being cc'd in the middle of a team
[2:50:31] itsnotkt: same as wrath
[2:50:36] Feroxita1337: fistweaving worked only when way of the crane was op because you were immune to cc during it
[2:50:38] itsnotkt: warriors onm a tier of there own
[2:50:41] thisisthotcaller: whats your take on DK so far?
[2:50:50] Wracrz: kyrian fire was pretty fun in solo shuffle
[2:51:15] tinustream: Which classes/specs are build around consistent damage the most? I hate the CD meta
[2:51:32] dizzle91: !music
[2:51:41] zyn0h: @tinustream wow will always be CD meta
[2:52:28] zyn0h: @tinustream if you want consistent damage then play any melee, but your cd are almost always going to determine whether you or a teammate lives or dies at elast in pvp
[2:53:18] zombieDolfin: Yeah you either need marks or to turn friendly player names on
[2:53:21] Khartax: For consistent i would say warlock/bm hunter
[2:53:23] leeka: are there no auto markers anymore
[2:53:29] leeka: oh must be just first round
[2:53:43] zombieDolfin: Yeah weird cause now they're on lol
[2:53:44] gainsjustintime: how's life ven
[2:54:28] gainsjustintime: I'm loving alll these talent choices
[2:56:35] Felrane: still play overwatch?
[2:56:58] Felrane: ive really been enjoying 2
[2:56:59] dizzle91: !monk
[2:56:59] Moobot: @dizzle91 Want to know what Venruki thinks of Monks in Shadowlands? https://clips.twitch.tv/DeterminedObliqueSashimiCopyThis
[2:57:12] playerwhat: 2 division
[2:57:14] playerwhat: i think
[2:59:10] Fixit_cat: trinket cocooooon
[2:59:35] UbbzyBoi: i come here for the mage propaganda though
[2:59:44] kukionz: he didn't block
[2:59:59] gainsjustintime: he blocked earlier
[2:59:59] winsong: he blocked already
[3:00:01] pourafour_: Can you show talents @venruki
[3:00:11] maxloyko: mage lost literally every game
[3:00:13] maxloyko: lol
[3:00:18] 3mirrors: sometimes bad things happen to good people
[3:00:35] gainsjustintime: I don't think arcane is the way lol
[3:00:48] kukionz: lol solo shuffle games are going to start ending w/ "report XXX" like lol
[3:01:24] maxloyko: @gainsjustintime he just. cont know how to play)
[3:01:36] storm_chaser_ron: i don't like any MP game isolated like this
[3:01:41] zombieDolfin: That mage eats dmage for breakfast
[3:01:41] nnumbing: lets make voice a thing in these solo shuffles, make it popular ven
[3:01:42] kukionz: Yeha, wow works best if you have a strong social network in it
[3:01:45] sy10xx: i have never played with voice lol even von 2,5 i dont have friends
[3:01:55] sy10xx: on**
[3:02:03] Emerno: the whole point of solo shuffle is that players hate talking to eachother LUL
[3:02:03] maxloyko: 3*3 solo is crap need 2*2 without heals and tanks
[3:02:04] Xekani: cant you just do regular 3s for that?
[3:02:06] Tormention: GGs Ven i was the priest
[3:02:09] kukionz: You hit 2.5 w/o voice?
[3:02:11] Secretwombatbro: Solo shuffle is the option for semi-social folks
[3:02:12] whitcomovich: But to me soloshuffle doesn't replace arena, it just gives me an option to play something mellow if my mates arent on
[3:02:20] SPENCERGUH: 1 hour of solo shuffle, 0 rating changes LUL
[3:02:20] KeshishJ: @venruki Watch the vod for the insta full heal
[3:02:27] sy10xx: @kukionz yes multiple times
[3:02:31] Secretwombatbro: You just wanna hop on and play your fav game but don’t have to put a lot of social effort in
[3:02:40] kukionz: @sy10xx  that's impressive
[3:02:42] fruitvendorx: Leaving solo should = the equivalent of 12 rounds of losing rating instead of their current penalty
[3:02:56] 3mirrors: its just a better version of skirmish to me @whitcomovich
[3:03:08] leeka: the rating loss from afking isnt even in the game yet
[3:03:26] Tormention: GGs Ven i was the Disc priest
[3:03:28] nnumbing: yea you can use a command to leave SOLO q rn where you dont lose points and dont even get deserter rofl
[3:03:37] fovven: idk man, sitting in que as dps for 20 minutes to start off well then have someone leave is kinda sad
[3:03:41] maxloyko: solo should be 2*2 without healers and tanks
[3:03:45] rumba12345678: ven, is ww dead?)
[3:03:51] leeka: @nnumbing no deserter? wtf
[3:04:07] zyn0h: every song i hear on this stream is such a vibe
[3:04:09] sy10xx: @nnumbing what is it ?
[3:04:10] nnumbing: @leeka yea it isnt widely known but I know people doing it
[3:04:13] sy10xx: asking for a frien
[3:04:17] Ramoneko: watched this poor mage, any tips for arcane survives? everyone wnat to burn him now
[3:04:34] dmgcurry: i thought they were going to change it to count as 6 losses if u leave?
[3:05:03] sy10xx: go ww
[3:05:03] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[3:05:12] Secretwombatbro: It’s also a nice break from fighting formatted teams too. Almost an older wow pvp experience, just fighting what shows up and dealing with that on the fly feels fun. For me anyways
[3:05:45] ciderbyte: Shadow priest?
[3:06:54] kukionz: solo shuffle seems promising. Interesting to see how it will go
[3:07:06] fruitvendorx: Wish they would disable legendaries and covenants at least
[3:07:35] mutual: is he horde or alliance?
[3:08:59] KingChur: @nevrisx for real this shit is not fun to heal its awful
[3:09:41] Borngood: how'd the mw games go
[3:11:15] storm_chaser_ron: @Borngood so good, he had zero problems keeping up with the dh and aff lock damage
[3:11:38] deutersx: !talents
[3:11:38] Nightbot: Here is a list of all the different talent builds I use: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[3:11:54] Borngood: @storm_chaser_ron nice, was it fun?
[3:12:25] Borngood: same feel that on hpal too
[3:12:26] storm_chaser_ron: sorry that was sarcastic
[3:12:27] kaljaen: wtf is that mount lol
[3:12:29] Borngood: cant do it anymore.
[3:12:32] leeka: The dragon healer looks fun for solo shuffle
[3:12:34] thommiepls: You're at the mercy of the dps lol
[3:12:39] KeshishJ: disco
[3:12:40] KeshishJ: gotcha
[3:12:46] guavvv: thats why i play disc lmao
[3:12:48] storm_chaser_ron: too many healbot healers in wow pvp
[3:13:01] highmoon7: Fistweaver
[3:13:02] Borngood: nah it's not good
[3:13:16] Wogrim: it should be like that
[3:13:28] Wogrim: then more people would play healer
[3:13:32] kekburkek: yo vencocki xD
[3:14:02] kekburkek: how is new expansion?
[3:14:19] UbbzyBoi: Heres a random question @venruki, whats your guilty pleasure drink. Mine is an ICED cold Dr. pepper
[3:14:46] sy10xx: @kekburkek you life in the future where expansion is already out?
[3:15:12] UbbzyBoi: Diet is your guilty pleasure? oof
[3:15:24] BaldSpiceTV: Diet Pepsi is the king of all sodas no cap
[3:15:28] MoneyKrusher1: Dr Pepper here also....  Mix this with spiced rum... and i m in business
[3:15:52] Synckery: Hey Ven, what’s your thoughts on the HP buff in DF?
[3:15:54] UbbzyBoi: When I was in college one of my professors said his comfort food was CELERY what a sociopath
[3:16:40] nnumbing: its good with peanut butter
[3:16:50] Smallwalrus: just heard about the PvP item level change... LOVE IT
[3:16:50] 3mirrors: stop spreading lies @nnumbing
[3:16:55] zirstro: Nope. Not even in soup
[3:16:58] Synckery: Celery is absolutely trash tier
[3:16:59] MoneyKrusher1: with salmon also...
[3:17:00] mutual: Anyone UI code import?
[3:17:02] KeshishJ: have you tried pierogi? polish food
[3:17:02] Felrane: with dip
[3:17:02] glaivedigger: I put it in my Gumbo when I make it
[3:17:07] ScenarioLabs: I love peanut butter and celery is not even good in that context.
[3:17:19] KeshishJ: yo look up halusky from slovakia
[3:17:50] thrasher1990: cellery is needed for a good classic italian soffrito, to m<ke bolognese or ragu
[3:18:02] ReidoS1990: how is DF frost looking?
[3:18:06] CmxtheWW: Thoughts on df???
[3:18:15] LiLb444: What is a Canadian dish that you enjoy that I could look up and make at home? I don't know many Canadian founded dishes
[3:18:18] glaivedigger: It's almost cold enough here to make some good Lentil Soup.
[3:18:24] sy10xx: thoughts on your thoughts?
[3:18:25] Borngood: back to work cya at raid :)
[3:18:29] kritikos5: poutine
[3:18:30] Odinss0n: poutine
[3:18:31] UbbzyBoi: POUTINE!
[3:18:34] trixsta_: ^
[3:18:37] SeaDJay: beaver tails
[3:18:37] MoneyKrusher1: Shepperds pie.... Poutine
[3:18:39] WhatTheFlux89: White castle
[3:18:43] Emerno: tortiere
[3:18:43] kritikos5: maple syrup
[3:18:48] SeaDJay: peameal bacon sandwich
[3:18:50] Synckery: Anything + maple syrup
[3:18:59] 3mirrors: maple syrup poutine
[3:19:20] LiLb444: Poutine just looks like loaded french fries lol
[3:19:34] Cvarks: bro arcane missiles on beta hit for 7k and we have 400k hp. this hp buff is so fucked OMEGALUL
[3:20:06] zyn0h: that would be crazy if you had a video going over that specific topic xD
[3:20:12] 3mirrors: NotLikeThis
[3:20:14] Emerno: seriously though why didnt they just nerf healing
[3:20:32] Synckery: Azael?
[3:20:32] MoneyKrusher1: @LiLblitzy it is loaded
[3:20:50] KingChur: how is nerfing healing a viable solution? do you want the game to go from 10 total healers to 0?
[3:20:51] redforger: venruki i cant play frost mage without shimmer. i am too used to it
[3:21:13] redforger: i need those shimmers to get poly on the healer
[3:21:25] goatyoga420: turning tide tonight?? @venruki
[3:21:29] Emerno: @KingChur they buffed all hp and damage instead of nerfing healing... nerfing heals accomplishes the same without blowing the numbers back up into the millions again lol
[3:21:36] Synckery: @redforger you’ve got DB now tho as frost
[3:21:46] goatyoga420: i her shope so
[3:22:07] redforger: @Synckery but blink feels so bad on gbobalcd
[3:22:30] goatyoga420: @venruki what is hpal best 2v2 comp in wotlk? hpal / warrior is king?
[3:22:47] DOMTAQ: Ray of frost is really strong ? you dont play glacial spike ?
[3:22:49] Synckery: Ye it’s an adjustment in play style for sure @redforger but it’s really good to just negate all stuns
[3:22:52] rhokie_hunt: YELLO
[3:23:22] rhokie_hunt: I have faced, DH, in every, solo q today :D BibleThump
[3:23:28] redforger: @Synckery do you think mages can get 1800 running shimmer? 1800 would be my oersonal goals for the game which i would consider high mmr
[3:23:48] Innerverse: o Pog solo shuffle grind?
[3:24:28] rhokie_hunt: 3 out of the 4 solo shuffles I did people left the game and I got no rating
[3:24:35] bllazzin: when did they change being able to just shift out of polys?
[3:24:59] SPENCERGUH: like 12 years ago
[3:25:03] 0savitar0: mb if it was said already but what time is the naxx raid?
[3:25:04] Innerverse: ive qd so many solo shuffles
[3:25:18] Synckery: @redforger imo yes, 1800 should be doable as basically any spec and any talents
[3:25:28] jraunsmed: whats good
[3:25:32] goatyoga420: ray of frost??? LITTT
[3:25:33] Innerverse: seems like dh, and warlock giga op but besides that not too bad
[3:25:35] ReidoS1990: no deathborne?
[3:25:42] Koraszdormu: What's good Ven, how you doin' today bro?
[3:25:57] BlucherPVP: I think ring of fire is such a meme
[3:26:01] tpdty: is fire not good anymore?
[3:26:13] redforger: @BlucherPVP yea i dont like rung of fire
[3:26:37] bymz: @venruki are the new hp pool buffs on beta rn?
[3:26:44] StromicusRex: ven thinks he's playing wrath and locking people matters pepeLaugh
[3:26:50] bakedxd: bakedxd subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! Almost 5. rukiLove
[3:27:15] Synckery: The Sheep n Yeet, a classic
[3:27:16] redforger: @StromicusRex it matters thats like 5 seconds of cc
[3:27:31] fasteddywow: i ques with a frost mage that hit a 50k Glacial spike, you tried a build like that yet?
[3:27:57] Casrak: is this a singing stream now? if so im down
[3:28:00] rhokie_hunt: this Enhancement obviously hasn't watched any YouTube guides on how to absolutely fucking delete someone as Enh with Ele blast
[3:28:27] reedthesham: Enh did get the 25% nerf rip
[3:31:40] ozzyxy: first time?
[3:31:43] Avexel: Blast wave is clutch
[3:31:46] Laviette: How did you knock as a mage?
[3:32:05] Laviette: Oh it's blast wave thats back huh i see
[3:32:08] Avexel: Blast wave is gonna be game changing
[3:32:14] BlucherPVP: @Laviette mass polymoph Kappa
[3:32:43] Cvarks: living bomb does an astonishing 700 damage
[3:32:48] Cvarks: truly incredible
[3:32:53] Felrane: lol
[3:32:58] Cvarks: 400k hp btw
[3:33:06] BlucherPVP: nether tempest should hit as hard as feral dots. change my mind
[3:33:42] Cvarks: nether tempest hits for 2k!
[3:33:45] Cvarks: w full burst!@
[3:34:20] x_tazik: @venruki hi! how do you gear your pvp alts (how would you gear one, if you had a fresh char)? just spam bgs or is there any faster ways?)
[3:34:24] majko52: Hey ,will u prioritize more on wotlk or df
[3:34:25] DOMTAQ: gg
[3:34:37] Cybernytez: lol
[3:34:45] DOMTAQ: ice wall ?
[3:34:50] vindy__: i had like 4 solo shuffles as arcane with 5 wins and they left on all of them Sadge
[3:34:51] Cvarks: like at the very least buff damage w it, their reasoning was for healers healing too much
[3:35:07] pvalue01: I feel like a small hp bump makes sense but 40%????
[3:35:08] Moobot: Latest video "What Is The BEST MAGE SPEC To Play In Dragonflight?" view it here: youtu.be/tH03mozfck8
[3:35:09] Felrane: TL:DR is really great for cov mission table
[3:35:10] bymz: Isn’t death strike just gonna be super duper pooper good with the health change
[3:35:17] ryxd3366: @majko52 DF for sure as most streamers when it comes out
[3:35:24] guavvv: I think its a step in the right direction,getting hit for 200k in one global is not fun
[3:35:41] Avexel: HUGE
[3:35:42] Cvarks: arcane unplayable nerf frost
[3:35:44] Cvarks: cvarksArcane
[3:35:46] Innerverse: wtf
[3:35:48] rhokie_hunt: BAMMMMMMMMM
[3:35:52] zyn0h: scammed
[3:35:54] Fixit_cat: Iced elation
[3:35:55] Avexel: That looked fun af damn nice
[3:35:56] sy10xx: because they super low mmr
[3:36:00] kingkind: Nice plays dude
[3:36:00] Outer_Limitz: big discrepency between ratings there lol
[3:36:02] rhokie_hunt: solo shuffle should have glad mount change my mind
[3:36:10] guavvv: ur opponents are like 1400 rated
[3:36:10] redforger: the average of the team is lower than yours
[3:36:25] minno_09: @Innerverse warlocks have received some hotfixes to their survivability already     try dueling a warrior or DK outside of SW without conduits   they break dark pact in 3 seconds    I can't speak for AFF though I play destruction
[3:36:26] sy10xx: your is 1,8 they were 1,5 i hought you get no rating at all
[3:36:28] redforger: your mmr was 1800 the team mmr was 1500
[3:36:46] denbrady87: deserve more tha  34  O.o
[3:37:03] Innerverse: yea im mainly talking with covs+condi+leggo since im qing soloshuffle @minno_09
[3:37:05] ryxd3366: @scoodiex I prefer great titles over mounts but not the current ones
[3:37:18] minno_09: gotcha
[3:37:30] Innerverse: how long have ur qs been
[3:37:49] sy10xx: its like going to kindergarden and beat up 6 kids what you deserve for that
[3:38:05] amakkey90: For fun :)
[3:38:05] KonstantinosR12: Do you enjow forst the most?
[3:38:07] Adang508: Yes you would have lost a ton if you only won 2-3
[3:38:08] redforger: they probably have this system for faster qs. if we want more even match making qs will take longer
[3:38:11] rhokie_hunt: @ryxd3366 why not both
[3:38:13] FluffiRina: The problem is the matchmaking then putting you with low mmr
[3:38:19] kingkind: @sy10xx jail time?
[3:38:26] zionzorshin: is windwalker trAsh now?
[3:38:26] Avexel: Have you tried arcane or fire yet?
[3:38:43] sy10xx: @kingkind yes but no rating right :)
[3:38:48] rhokie_hunt: can't wait to be 2300mmr in solo shuffle, no one is q'ing and it puts me with an 1800 LUL
[3:38:48] cheeseburgxx: trying to level a shaman for DF but am stuck at 55 cause cant dungeon but theres 100 quest to unlock them at 2k xp each. Why blizz
[3:39:02] ronaldhow: q it up
[3:39:23] Innerverse: yea i was 2500mmr in solo q sitting a 1hr 30min q, into a 2k team :(
[3:39:26] rhokie_hunt: ruki1D ruki1D
[3:39:26] Strife24821: jesus
[3:39:29] Avexel: Oh no LUL rank 1 vs regular player
[3:39:30] DaneDillon: LUL
[3:39:37] DaneDillon: ruki1D ruki1D ruki1D
[3:39:42] sy10xx: he trinketed db xD
[3:39:45] Avexel: GOT WRECKED
[3:40:05] rhokie_hunt: DH's think they can get away with anything these days, zero impulse control
[3:40:19] FluffiRina: Is nobody playing retail? Q times are so long for pvp Sadge
[3:40:30] dashawn0022: frost or unholy dk ?
[3:40:52] Cvarks: frostruki is killin it
[3:41:04] imruck: dragonflight feels so weird tbh
[3:41:06] Zlipps: Ven surely you know this. Where has the target of target keybind gone?
[3:41:12] shyroth__: is snowdrift good?
[3:41:22] ktcheshire: u not playting arcane
[3:41:45] goonstate: thoughts on tauren mage for DF?
[3:42:02] law4d93: warstomp
[3:42:09] law4d93: warstomp poly
[3:42:12] ReidoS1990: I thought you said snowdrift is good in your YouTube vid?
[3:42:44] ReidoS1990: fair
[3:42:45] datflap: what does frostbomb even do
[3:42:57] par1si: thassa nice mog ven
[3:42:59] guuchyflipflops: Is it unfair that enhance got dumpstered but nothing for lock in pvp?
[3:43:05] zyn0h: like living bomb but for frotst?
[3:43:06] chisnoi: so its living bomb :D
[3:43:09] redforger: everytime someone says times change i just think of garrosh
[3:43:15] engzyng: does it shatter with flurry ?
[3:43:18] chisnoi: aah
[3:43:23] chisnoi: ok fair
[3:43:27] datflap: times change
[3:43:27] Cvarks: and it actually does damage unlike living bomb MiniK
[3:43:31] datflap: god tier cinematic
[3:43:37] FluffiRina: If you q for 2v2 or 3v3 arena the qs are much less than solo
[3:43:48] chisnoi: would be cool if it had like a chains of ice effect decaying heavy slow
[3:44:05] redforger: what if they double the radius of snowdrift? will that be good enough
[3:44:09] jraunsmed: Yo ven whats the build your Running ?
[3:44:12] ktcheshire: how do u find arcane in pvp?
[3:44:12] nnumbing: ice nova is so fun
[3:44:16] youngfella: is destro bad in pve do u know? @venruki
[3:44:29] Cvarks: i said that
[3:44:30] nnumbing: I NEVER SAID THAT BISH
[3:44:32] nnumbing: GRR
[3:44:34] Avexel: That mount has the derpiest jump
[3:44:35] sy10xx: you are not in que :)
[3:44:48] Cvarks: that was all me and i stand by it
[3:44:57] nnumbing: really debating if I want shifting power at 70 or not
[3:45:04] Avexel: @youngfella as a destro main it’s alright affli is stronger supposedly rn
[3:45:10] youngfella: meant in wrath
[3:45:12] youngfella: btw
[3:45:13] nnumbing: its hard to get shifting + full time manipulation and ice nova
[3:45:14] Cvarks: @nnumbing i think its worth over wall/time anom in a lot of scenarios
[3:45:23] ReidoS1990: frost your fav spec so far in DF?
[3:45:30] Avexel: @youngfella in wrath nvm then
[3:45:48] nnumbing: time displacement seems like a high skill move tbh
[3:45:56] zyn0h: ive never liked displacement personally, like why would i go right back to the area i was just trying to escape from, idk maybe im bad
[3:46:02] nnumbing: I mean displacement***
[3:46:04] sy10xx: you think que time for solo will be faster in df?
[3:46:10] vindy__: i like displacement only for the trash buff LUL i think the spell is kinda trash with it being on GCD
[3:46:48] Innerverse: oh its on gcd?
[3:46:54] Zefironer: Hey ven where I can see your pvp talents
[3:46:55] nnumbing: kiting around pillars with displacement is really good
[3:46:56] calmbroski: god retail retail just looks so much diff from classic
[3:47:15] nnumbing: mugambala is crazy for it
[3:47:43] nnumbing: ice flows still doesnt modify surge :((
[3:47:58] cbloch98: Will frost be good in df you think?
[3:48:13] calmbroski: i swear the graphics look more cartoony in retail
[3:48:15] Cvarks: what ab the orange vibe
[3:48:43] foobanana: @calmbroski indeed. It's more like Zelda BotW
[3:48:59] ReidoS1990: why the hell can't mages have deep freeze I don't get it
[3:49:02] Schkoodie: Its that WOW ?
[3:49:19] calmbroski: i told myself i wont play DF but knowing myself i know i will
[3:49:20] cbloch98: I always hated frost mages when I played with my friend in cata/mop, cause he would always gank my warrior so easy back then
[3:49:20] Avexel: Long ass queue time Sadge
[3:49:31] Innerverse: everyone q up solo q :)
[3:49:39] Luigicamp: Breath of the wow
[3:49:55] foobanana: I think it's because they are using more pastel colors
[3:49:55] aminobomb: getting 50k arcane surges followed by 30k arcane barrages its amazing - arcane dream is alive and well
[3:50:07] DaneDillon: I have tried q'ing solo shuffle a couple of mornings before work and it's like 20 minute ques.
[3:50:20] calmbroski: i kinda wish they got rid of covenants in DF
[3:50:24] zerozhr: yes Pog
[3:50:26] datflap: i got hit by a 120k glacial spike on prepatch today
[3:50:27] croivan18: yes try it
[3:50:32] aminobomb: ive seen it work - its just so hard to survive against all the mongo cleave in solo shuffle
[3:50:35] datflap: ice form shenanings could be a cheeesy spec
[3:50:39] croivan18: Raiku was playing it
[3:51:29] croivan18: i can import you Raikus talents if you want @venruki
[3:51:36] croivan18: with glacial
[3:51:53] Cvarks: why arent u playing the new mitch jones build?
[3:51:55] zyn0h: making your own talents is part of the f u n
[3:52:01] nnumbing: what do you think of shifting power vs TA build ven?
[3:52:03] Cvarks: MiniK
[3:52:07] zerozhr: is the rating unchange if loss to solo shuffle intended? either way i dont see how the system wont be exploited. either leave if farmed or get 1 round win and leave
[3:52:09] amherian001: new pvp changes /discuss
[3:52:14] Cvarks: time anom is still bugged tho
[3:52:17] Cvarks: so it can suck a lot of the time
[3:52:22] nnumbing: TA doesnt proc time warp :(
[3:52:24] redforger: glacial spike is the coolest frost ability ever. sad that for the whole wxpansion wasnt playted
[3:52:56] Cvarks: @nnumbing i think they saw ur tweet ab magi and ice nova icon.
[3:53:02] nnumbing: yea they did lol
[3:53:40] AWreal: glacial spike does 200k on the beta (to a dummy so like... 160k to a player)
[3:54:14] RastislavConka: looks like shadowlands 2 in terms of pvp
[3:54:40] 311623channel: hi ven, please share your talents
[3:54:42] FSI88: I was getting one-deag'd for 100-150k from glacial spike in arenas a couple days ago
[3:54:48] venruki: BAEAHVkVsxxZrVqBmAzlSR2f7LIRCikIJNBUkIiISAAAAgEJkkkIpkkkUCAAAAAAAAAgA
[3:54:51] zyn0h: pre patch is always wonky tho
[3:54:51] Cvarks: cant be shadowlands 2 since rmp wont be a thing in season !
[3:54:56] redforger: i enjoyed shadowlands pvp
[3:55:01] zerozhr: do all the systems work in M+ on prepatch as well
[3:55:04] zyn0h: pre patches*
[3:55:04] 311623channel: thank you soo much
[3:55:07] Cvarks: LMFAO
[3:55:12] taftvaluee: enjoooy
[3:55:13] Cvarks: time to 1 shot glacial spike tanks
[3:55:17] Avexel: LOL
[3:55:20] DaneDillon: rukiEw
[3:55:20] zyn0h: this will hurt to watch i think
[3:55:28] qkmood: cowabunga
[3:55:35] sy10xx: this is so dumb why blizzard doesnt get bombarded about getting rid of tanks in solo q
[3:56:09] Cvarks: u gotta hope they dont all insta enter
[3:56:25] sy10xx: @Rearwind ty
[3:56:53] tinspoon: that is so troll
[3:56:57] DannyQuik: the jump thrash rotation EZ
[3:57:00] zyn0h: his name is Bully too, just unreal
[3:57:02] lilithspriest: arent you glad you had to wait 5-8 minutes for this que? lmao
[3:57:13] balanceiskey1993: dont people ever think 3s is too much to keep track of?
[3:57:18] twin1123: its so hard to like wow when ppl are like this
[3:57:21] calmbroski: lol low lvl pre patch arena is always crazy wierd
[3:57:23] Zlipps: give him the old /spit
[3:57:32] magixss: just remove tanks, they have nothing to tank in arena.. get em out
[3:57:33] RastislavConka: million dmg modifiers, casting while walking. yep definetly pvp gonna suck
[3:57:45] proooof: having pvp especially arena with tanks feels so awful its not the place
[3:58:00] McLarge: Mmm, nahh. It's definitely partially on him for acting like that. Tank players know damn well that no one wants to play with or against them, but they queue anyway.
[3:58:20] Jeepleet: why is game over after 1 dies
[3:58:46] croivan18: is void elf the best race for mages now ?
[3:58:49] zyn0h: solo shuffle gunna be full of all tank teams
[3:58:49] zerozhr: i can already see it, High mmr solo shuffle will be so toxic with people like acusing people of inting them cause people with beef with q with eachother lol
[3:58:50] Avexel: It’s solo shuffle Jeep
[3:59:34] zerozhr: agree'd
[3:59:52] sy10xx: @ZinEssenceX i dont think you understand how solo shuffle works
[4:00:22] Cvarks: LMFAO
[4:00:30] zerozhr: Sadge
[4:00:35] mangoeaglez: looks so fun
[4:00:35] UltraContent: no tanks in wrath ? :(
[4:00:54] Innerverse: nooooo dont leave retail :(
[4:01:00] taftvaluee: VENTruki
[4:01:01] magixss: they really need to remove tanks from arena period
[4:01:26] Shoremane: make solo shuffle for tanks so they have 3tanks vs 3 tanks

[4:02:15] Innerverse: its the tanks and leavers really ruin it hard
[4:02:50] zerozhr: hahaahah
[4:02:55] croivan18: LUL
[4:02:56] SPENCERGUH: retail so bad
[4:02:58] UltraContent: why just dont create a 3v3 matches for tanks, so they go 3 tanks vs 3 tanks

[4:03:10] SippinSimpSyrup: POGGERS
[4:03:11] wackpoetic: TBF, Guardian Druid has been overpowered in PvP since Shadowlands S1
[4:03:13] lilithspriest: because i feel like that cant be ignored
[4:03:14] Zlipps: And that is a perfect example of who out of touch the devs have become with the game.

[4:03:37] UltraContent: @venruki  dont u think 3 tank vs 3 tank could be the solution? no one want to play with them , so is kinda fair they play only with each others
[4:03:48] McLarge: Oh good, I just queued into a Solo Shuffle and now I have Bully in my game
[4:03:51] wackpoetic: Once people caught on to Sleeper Legendary you couldn't even queue a Yolo Rated Battleground as a non-Guardian Druid above like 1200
[4:03:52] DaneDillon: DaneDillon is paying forward the Gift they got from an anonymous gifter to magnusz!

[4:04:17] zerozhr: they have the tech, they made it where prot pala can only Q into prot pala, so tech they could make it where 6 tanks all just in same arena KEKW
[4:04:19] eralexx: u can dodge tank Qeue by loging out and loging in again without losing Qeue time

[4:16:42] Banwellx: thank you for your apology. it is not accepted. PaulyD is on ur playlist?
[4:18:38] datflap: @venruki idk what the setup for it is but necro frost can hit 100k+ glacial spikes. i know it uses ice form to cheese it
[4:19:32] d8a_gg: Wow you can change mid arena now? That’s so cool !
[4:19:50] Slendertall: what race is thid called chat?
[4:19:53] flexzuu: @venruki did you talk about the pvp bluepost (40% stam increase) already?

[4:25:00] Secretwombatbro: i mean it took him like 2-3 minutes to set up

[4:29:49] Nightbot: Venruki Wrath as of 13/10/22 PauseChamp https://clips.twitch.tv/BlindingPuzzledDurianRitzMitz-JjhjoVsC2YvhR0xD

[4:31:34] NoCulturex: y
[4:31:44] causemosmvp: u can do flamestrike max rank + lower rank
[4:32:28] NoCulturex: frostfire>?
[4:32:47] narto535: How many times can you loot raids and dungeons every week. Sorry I’m a new player
[4:32:54] NoCulturex: no
[4:33:13] MuRRRkn: dont nee them for pve anyways
[4:33:17] NoCulturex: playfrostfire
[4:33:25] NoCulturex: better thill later
[4:33:30] causemosmvp: Frostfire better now
[4:33:40] jpgaming262: Yeah, I think you need more crit for fire.
[4:33:49] jpgaming262: :)
[4:33:52] NoCulturex: frostfire is better now/ TTW i good with more crit
[4:33:58] Stanlec: try this https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/guide/classes/mage/fire/dps-talent-builds-glyphs-pve
[4:34:23] Stanlec: SeemsGood
[4:34:40] NoCulturex: icy veins op
[4:34:52] bllazzin: idk i feel like ice shard an icy veins make frostfire work, idk whats gonna make the straight fire work
[4:34:52] MuRRRkn: reduces cast time
[4:34:54] Adessius: Did I miss the Dragonflight stream? :(
[4:34:56] ReidoS1990: should of removed the range on spells for db and blastwave
[4:35:19] hugoboss_: @Adessius he quit
[4:35:20] Moobot: Latest video "What Is The BEST MAGE SPEC For PvP In Dragonflight?" view it here: youtu.be/tH03mozfck8
[4:35:22] hugoboss_: !quit
[4:35:22] Nightbot: Yes, Venruki has quit whatever game or class he isn't playing now. I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
[4:35:31] NoCulturex: if u play this spec u need to take care of ignite munchin look it up u need 2 marcos for pyro and fireball
[4:35:32] archi1800: do you know guys what ilvl will got catch up gear?
[4:35:38] Adessius: @Adessius obviously thats what happens when you log off of a game
[4:36:03] Westeros: cqs
[4:36:04] DaBstar9000: cqs
[4:36:21] NoCulturex: yes
[4:37:06] waitingforbgs: what does /CQS do?
[4:37:07] KeyvanB_: @venruki try this https://wago.io/S9KU37W4R
[4:37:20] NoCulturex: i think is /cqs fist
[4:37:28] mawmale: Ven, is it really 7am for you there?
[4:37:44] ssj2cooler: i thnk the WA is better andd you get to set the delay
[4:37:54] mikehaawk92: hello ven, i have a WA and a macro for you that works 100% fine
[4:37:57] Westeros: This results in ~2.5% loss in DPS in P1 BIS, and up to ~10% loss in DPS in ICC BIS.  You can use a CQS macro to add a slight delay to your pyroblast to avoid ignite munching. Even though adding delays is not ideal, it still results in a substantial DPS increase.
[4:38:04] Westeros: Macro  /cqs/cast Pyroblast/cqs
[4:38:13] mikehaawk92: can i post this here?
[4:38:16] Ohq__: imagine not being a lua coder to play the game properly LUL
[4:38:22] waitingforbgs: is this top tier sweatlord macro stuff going on?
[4:38:34] NoCulturex: so its
[4:38:45] NoCulturex: /cqs
[4:38:46] ssj2cooler: if you have the cqs pyro i think you only use the macro on hot streaks immediately after fireball
[4:39:24] mikehaawk92: ven, check this
[4:39:28] mikehaawk92: https://wago.io/S9KU37W4R
[4:39:30] KeyvanB_: it makes me not like fire :)
[4:39:37] thefatp1g: @venruki terrible change imo, thoughts ?
[4:39:45] KeyvanB_: @venruki its the same weakaura I sent you
[4:39:53] DaBstar9000: don't think you need one for fireball
[4:39:54] ssj2cooler: i dont thikn you need it for fireball
[4:39:55] Westeros: I don't think you need one for fireball
[4:40:06] ssj2cooler: only for the instant pyros right after fireball
[4:40:07] mikehaawk92: you need the macro for pyro
[4:40:14] mikehaawk92: because pyro travels the same speed than fireball
[4:40:15] Kiwle: Did they change something?
[4:40:16] ssj2cooler: so not even for every pyro
[4:40:22] Ohq__: its sucks because ignite is like 10% of your dmg in icc
[4:40:26] mikehaawk92: if 2 fire spells hit at the exact time ignite is shitty
[4:40:31] mrinsanity9611: hey man when are you raiding
[4:40:40] ssj2cooler: youre just tryingto make sure that fireball + instant pyro dont hit together
[4:40:56] Westeros: I believe you reg cast pyro if you get a hot streak from living bomb. Otherwise you use the cqs macro on typical hot streaks
[4:40:59] causemosmvp: you dont need macro for that just get used to it
[4:41:11] ScenarioLabs: You're not using the macro now though?
[4:41:15] Westeros: non macro'd pyro, of course*
[4:41:22] causemosmvp: it is with your gear
[4:41:24] Ohq__: fire frost is absolutely better in my experience
[4:41:27] mikehaawk92: bro trust me, this specc is NUTS
[4:41:31] bllazzin: the icy shards talent
[4:41:35] NoCulturex: firefrost is better :(
[4:41:41] NoCulturex: thill toc i think
[4:41:44] tjzlock: you dont have a slow up for ttw as well
[4:41:54] Cogmer: ttw fire? Pog
[4:42:04] Soulhaven85: you should pay a rogue to give you tricks all night
[4:42:17] DaBstar9000: the spec profits a lot from raid buffs, so dummy dps doesn't say much
[4:42:29] mikehaawk92: your fireball and pyro are hitting the same time
[4:42:31] KeyvanB_: Tricks doesnt work for logging
[4:42:48] KeyvanB_: tricksing a mage or anyone so they can parse is a meme and a waste of tricks
[4:42:53] ScenarioLabs: @KeyvanB_zgz Does it just attribute the extra damage to the rogue?
[4:43:07] KeyvanB_: the only class it works on is locks for snapshotting dots and rogues
[4:43:35] Cogmer: the curse of the turning tide
[4:43:38] thefatp1g: @venruki have you tried beta with the 40% HP change?
[4:43:51] mrinsanity9611: is your guild not fully tiered yet ?

[4:44:19] Alb_SWE: Do you have BiS build for fire pve?
[4:44:26] thefatp1g: My warlock is at 470k HP unbuffed
[4:45:08] thefatp1g: dark pact was like 340 when I tried it after nerf with change
[4:45:41] Stanlec: how many emblems of valor do you have?
[4:46:21] EyyRa: found out today you can change valor to heroism 1 to 1

[4:48:38] kone_malone: As an enhance shaman new pools feel awful
[4:48:38] McLarge: I bet as a DH, I'll love the increased hp pools
[4:48:50] inspirox: if i don't see big lock nerfs DF aint for me lol
[4:49:05] vmewo: yeah solo shuffle is rough for setup specs that need like triple cross
[4:49:06] mmarkers: as a healer yeah lol. BUT if they dont add solo shuffle level dampening we gonna see some LONGGG 3s games
[4:49:11] bllazzin: no flame, but stop sayin hp pools
[4:49:16] mmarkers: esp with evoker/mw games
[4:49:17] kone_malone: They need to give locks the Enhance treatment
[4:49:20] inspirox: more hp, more defensives, more cc, than any other caster. let's make them top damage
[4:49:22] vmewo: @bllazzin LOL
[4:49:27] vmewo: well hp stands for health points
[4:49:33] vmewo: not health pools
[4:49:36] vmewo: or hit points
[4:49:36] crlpton: can u actually change emblem of valor for heroism
[4:49:47] Brosie1987: not yet

[4:50:54] Ohq__: absolutely nothing
[4:50:56] crlpton: <3 @inspirox
[4:51:08] kone_malone: Hogman is playing again!?
[4:51:14] DaBstar9000: just play double mage 2s to thin out the mage pool
[4:51:17] nikthevoker: YOURE ON TOO LATE

[4:51:47] Ohq__: sonii got booted of that "better mmo" for doing 1v1s in the wrong zone LUL
[4:52:07] McLarge: Wouldn't say it's a better mmo, but it's definitely not a WoW
[4:52:35] Skullomat: im kidding about the better mmo thing
[4:52:43] 3mirrors: all jokes aside its actually a lot better now, y'all should check it out

[4:53:51] lootacriss: no one plays or streams that game anymore for reasons
[4:53:59] thrasher1990: its just fresh servers, the leveling with pvpin is fun af the endgame is the problem

[6:45:24] epicbluej: lot of casters in ur raid comp
[6:46:27] epicbluej: Yea amazing, just makes loot more competitive tbh
[6:48:45] F0RTEE: ignite bug :/
[6:48:52] azrieltwitch: what you mean rotation is bugged for fie?
[6:51:10] F0RTEE: Buff scales so nice with fire
[6:51:14] epicbluej: the buff you get is great for fire
[6:51:15] thrasher1990: Because fire scales, and this boss amplifies ur dmg by a ton
[6:51:18] DaBstar9000: because it's a long fight
[6:51:36] assrug: isn't the buff literally % dmg increase?
[6:52:06] DaBstar9000: @thrasher1990 the percentage-based buff does the same for everyone. mages can switch sides easily with blink and fire profits from longer fights compared to arcane
[6:52:11] epicbluej: How ur mana feel on the longer fights?
[6:52:44] Varaben: yall pullin quick, nice
[6:52:59] Zrock6969: No Gdkp?

[6:54:58] epicbluej: You dont do the scorch debuff on boss?
[6:55:03] assrug: snared = slowed right
[6:55:13] miihxh: does that work on bosses tho=
[6:55:15] miihxh: ?
[6:55:23] Chubbydizz: @epicbluej demo and affliction locks do it passively
[6:55:52] Zrock6969: Do you need any gear from here or are just running for the weekly tokens?
