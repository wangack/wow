[0:31:19] nightmoonx11: @beef_00 Has it occurred to people that DH is more represented at high rating because more skilled players play DH, and not because the class is OP? Personally I mained Subrogue until 1200 rating, then switched to DH after I got a lot of xp, and now I'm 2200 rating. It's all about hard work and skill, not the class.
[0:31:29] onetrickp: @nightmoonx11 yes at 1600 its super op

[5:45:09] Solushun: i wish i had that innocence
[5:45:37] runnnnnit: you dont know climb
[5:46:06] Dinosauer: climbing 2300-2500 feels harder than 2500-2700
[5:46:07] runnnnnit: do a 1400 to 2600 stream
[5:46:09] Solushun: you playing the slot machine sometimes as healer
[5:46:24] Solushun: cuz when theres a bad DPS the other DPS can go 4-2 healer auto 3-3
[5:46:27] Solushun: its awful
[5:46:29] Sheepyou: last day venruki had a warrior with 7500 games ..kinda crazy
[5:46:32] runnnnnit: do a 1400 to 2700 challenge

[5:47:47] Dinosauer: damage is way lower at high rating
[5:47:52] runnnnnit: do a 1400 to 2700 challenge
[5:47:52] squire394: I feel like image needs to shit out heals by its self - give it a somewhat edge like trents for rdru. Seems quite lackluster
[5:48:25] garlicmanx: I don't know of this is still valid but pushing into top 10 for holy I would spam PW:S and use angel form for mana because it would make me oom
[5:48:26] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:48:30] MrCrippels: im having super fun in 2s and feel like i do a good job, but solo shuffle feels horrible. Must be a big skill gap from 2s to 3s?
[5:48:41] garlicmanx: But that might be bait not sure
[5:49:11] runnnnnit: 1400 to 2700 without mmr
[5:49:35] satan2k: Supatease actually had an input on the solo shuff system for healers. He said whats ur saying that u need 4-2 to actually climb atleast. But he wanted implement where between two healers in a solo it counted whoever kept their teammates alive for the longest time period, and if you beat ur opposite healer with lets say 2min in up time, your 3-3 actually would count as an 4-2 just so you could climb as healer.
[5:49:39] satan2k: Whats ur thought?
[5:49:44] Solushun: cdru is consistent

[5:53:58] Adin0r: Kappa
[5:54:06] garlicmanx: Thats actually true if you used dome hed suddenly remember he has legs and run out of it
