[5:22:19] YEETlCUS: are you hyped for hero talents
[5:22:22] imodesty: just get resonated, def catless
[5:22:35] the_boogalorian: if youre in cali dont go no cats
[5:22:37] imodesty: if you go straight pipe it’ll sounds to raspy trust
[5:22:38] arobahn: smells good
[5:22:49] the_boogalorian: youll have a nightmare with emissions and shit. so much money and so much hassle
[5:23:03] 475nm: the smell makes you dizzy real quick
[5:23:05] arobahn: smells like good pussy and 3 million dollars
[5:23:08] Vunoka: When does season end?
[5:23:11] vaspor: go to the airport and use jet girl

[5:23:16] sympathysong: i had to drive my old k5 blazer home from the shop one time, no pipes at all. straight headers. it was crazy
[5:23:19] imodesty: e85 trueeee
[5:23:19] silviic: loving the music xD
[5:23:23] imodesty: smells sooo good
[5:23:44] arobahn: driver doesn’t smell. fuck the haters
[5:23:59] mfwillie: im running no cats on my truck and it do be stankin but it stank so good lmao
[5:24:02] syphonx23: No cats not worth. High flow cats best option.
[5:24:22] Myth_The_Wolf: Chat, what class should I get 1800 rating with next? Options are Mage/Lock/Paladin
[5:24:34] syphonx23: Kids today think no cats is cool because they think loud equals good, but that's not the case, it's more about tone. That sounds good.
[5:24:35] 475nm: need resonators tho fr, the sound on highway makes your ears bleed
[5:24:36] arobahn: not too loud. and smell is decent
[5:24:44] vaspor: get a Prius
[5:24:45] DontDv8: yeah you would be able to smell the diff
[5:24:46] imodesty: nobody wanting to make actual power has cats…
[5:24:46] silviic: what car are you driving @Pikabooirl ?
[5:24:49] trivotix: My car had three turbos on it. Deleted 2 of them and the third is attached to the turbo
[5:24:57] arobahn: sounds better for sure. like race race
[5:25:00] pr0x365: that lovely corn smell of E85
[5:25:03] weakpaw: man missing the cat
[5:25:09] TimmyShoes: fun fact: if you die in your house, cats will start eating you within a few hours. dogs won't eat you unless they start starving (and certain breeds like golden retriever will never eat you, even if starving)
[5:25:10] kingbeardog: The smell can vary but is often described as more potent, with some likening it to the smell of unburned fuel or sulfur. and more raspy and throaty sound at higher rpm
[5:25:11] anmusallam: gasoline is the best smell what are we saying
[5:25:13] DontDv8: "power"
[5:25:17] imodesty: the e92 m3 has 4 cats. I will now have 0 cats :)
[5:25:22] EeVeTV: I own an Evo X just under 500hp, straight pipe with only 1 res. Its not bad when driving around town but on the highway it gets loud.
[5:25:25] arobahn: cats ain’t really power. unless ur car very very modded
[5:25:28] the_boogalorian: just go with a good high flow cat man honestly. itll be better for your daily around driving and itll be WAY less of a commiefornia nightmare.
[5:25:31] srrymyfingerslip: it’s great if you’re still a teenage or under 30 lol
[5:25:34] the_boogalorian: no bad smell or nothing
[5:25:38] badcouchlock: I ran turbo back on my S4, hardly smelt anything
[5:25:41] arobahn: just sound.
[5:25:42] Vultro: Q pop let's go!
[5:25:50] Vunoka: I wanna lay pipe for a living
[5:25:53] DontDv8: i was straight piped for a day
[5:25:56] syphonx23: Smell is definitely noticeable
[5:25:58] coreysgametime: I used to drive a FedEx truck and I hit a bump and broke exhaust off motor let me tell you the rest of my day was hilarious
[5:26:02] DontDv8: over nighted mufflers the next day
[5:26:05] cow_hooves: what car is it
[5:26:08] Sleepysevenz: straight pipe is a ticket in the making
[5:26:08] kingbeardog: what do you drive?
[5:26:09] silviic: just drive on Ethanol (e85) - there is pure watrer coming off the exhaust xD
[5:26:16] cow_hooves: What car?
[5:26:21] Goblin_Seaman: punch MW is scary, jeez
[5:26:22] imodesty: don’t even touch your cats then if you’re not wanting to make power lol just get a muffler
[5:26:28] ralllller: Not my dumb EU brain thinking we were talking about actual cats and the way they smell LUL
[5:26:37] EeVeTV: You for sure smell it but typically only at a red light. Its not horrible but you smell it
[5:26:38] DontDv8: thats true too, i got 3 tickets for loud exhaust in cali for no cats
[5:26:39] fullsendru: e85 smells amazing
[5:26:42] mfwillie: on a real note, the smell of unburnt fuel and exhaust fumes is present but you'll mostly just smell it at idle @Pikabooirl
[5:26:42] silviic: cats- catalizator
[5:26:43] DontDv8: got stae reffed
[5:26:44] KpoxVR: I had it once it kinda depends tbh.. but shit is loud a.f when you hit the limiter.. gunshots maybe come close to it
[5:26:44] silviic: xD
[5:26:45] syphonx23: E85 you gonna get the power but it burns 30% faster
[5:26:50] arobahn: tune your car to have e85 and reg gas. so I can swap
[5:26:52] cow_hooves: What car pika?
[5:26:59] iamyippy: e85 burns fast asf
[5:26:59] silviic: @fullsendru amen on that!!!
[5:27:08] remickzstrafez: 2000 hp GTR
[5:27:13] arobahn: Sophia e85 lot cheaper too
[5:27:13] arobahn: GHR loves e85
[5:27:13] ralllller: @silviic Thanks man, I really couldn't figure it out, I'm not a car guy
[5:27:14] iamyippy: BRO MY BUDDY TUNES
[5:27:20] EeVeTV: @Pikabooirl Whatever you do don't do OTS maps. get it protuned.
[5:27:22] imodesty: yeah e85 annoying for that reason
[5:27:22] fullsendru: my wrx sti is on e85 but luckily the station is right down the street
[5:27:24] tehcahteh69: fist/DH is disgusting
[5:27:27] silviic: e85 is basically vodka (spirt)
[5:27:27] KpoxVR: you want to str pipe it? you crazy
[5:27:28] DontDv8: as soon as you mod it, shit breaks
[5:27:30] 475nm: what specifically are you concerned about with the smell?
[5:27:35] cow_hooves: FBO e85 is good level. I have hda friends with that setup and its reliable
[5:27:37] iamyippy: YOU WONT BREAK A GTR TILL AROUND 850-1250
[5:27:39] cow_hooves: Dont go anymore than that
[5:27:41] fullsendru: e85 has a sweet smell it doesn’t smell bad
[5:27:43] cow_hooves: Keep stock turbos
[5:27:50] mfwillie: @Pikabooirl but with modern unleaded fuel its not nearly as bad as it used to be compared to older cars that used leaded fuel lol
[5:27:51] nicolai0912: pro driver here, my engineer works on GTR's a lot he can talk to you about al this
[5:27:53] syphonx23: You definitely don't wanna fully straight pipe Ag. T. R. It's super loud and raspy
[5:27:55] wappiebro: will you pla yret as well?
[5:27:57] seymek: just got legendary on warrior lets goo
[5:28:01] Officialappletree: ignore that darkness
[5:28:01] cow_hooves: ALPHA 7 :D
[5:28:03] imodesty: GTR weak link is the trans right?
[5:28:06] trivotix: lmao my man used darkness
[5:28:12] vaspor: the darkness lol
[5:28:13] silviic: e85 is for turbo- because of higher detonation temps (safer for tuning)
[5:28:14] fullsendru: you just run pump gas every 3 tanks or so
[5:28:17] imodesty: and that transmission is like 20k
[5:28:20] EeVeTV: E85 has higher water molecules which is what ruins the injectors.
[5:28:23] srrymyfingerslip: fuck it blows my mind it up
[5:28:24] coreysgametime: I used to drive a FedEx truck and I hit a bump and broke exhaust off motor let me tell you the rest of my day was hilarious probably hear me bringing boxes a few miles away
[5:28:30] candycrush92: Hello all
[5:28:40] remickzstrafez: need to just go to a gtr shop tbh
[5:28:41] pr0x365: keep it stock
[5:28:45] srrymyfingerslip: blow it up

[5:29:00] remickzstrafez: r34?
[5:29:03] silviic: will bwe wheelspinin in 5th xD
[5:29:12] fullsendru: it’s really fast especially with the awd
[5:29:14] EeVeTV: Youll want to upgrade your injectors that are e85 compatible
[5:29:25] niuZIXIao: this Imfat shaman just left my shuffle
[5:29:27] imodesty: just gotta worry about trans tbh
[5:29:31] fullsendru: my sti makes 620whp and it’s almost too much for the street
[5:29:34] silviic: just go 1000cc and tune on e85 and you will be golden!
[5:29:45] starr2000: the best way to gear rn is buy honor gear from the vender or is there some fast track way
[5:30:10] silentmoonwalk: yo my favorite streamer i just turned in from Norway, i usually watch ur streams when ur offline.

[5:30:24] Butterrs8871: wtf was that burrow lol wild
[5:30:26] coreysgametime: ele seems wild
[5:30:28] EeVeTV: isn't ETS in portland?

[5:30:40] Officialappletree: i just dinged 70 on this dh 30 mins ago
[5:30:44] mfwillie: just run a 91 or 93 octane tune with bolts on and call it a day
[5:30:53] nicolai0912: he's close to irvine
[5:31:00] kwingas: kwingas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! YOOOOOO
[5:31:01] starr2000: @candycrush92 whats the gear called if you dont mind gonna snag some from the ah
[5:31:13] Vanguarded: Are you happy
[5:31:21] EeVeTV: @Pikabooirl Sorry got farmed with ads. ETS is in portland.
[5:31:25] ohshiieett: i wish i could spend a lot of cash rn
[5:31:28] snickersxdd: I love the music video to thins song

[5:31:32] ChocoFrieEcho: @pikabooirl are you ele rn big papa p.s beer for beer?
[5:31:40] vanity_tm: just dont do something you could regret
[5:31:41] moistydank: pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold
[5:31:52] Pikabooirl: pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold pikabooGold
[5:31:53] asenku11k: its a tbs rpg called evertald
[5:31:57] pr0x365: Fuck getting ref'd
[5:32:00] asenku11k: *evertale
[5:32:12] the_boogalorian: the r35 is basically drilled down to a formula at this point dude. a LOT of shops know exactly what theyre doing with it and if not theres a lot of available information out there. id look into the type of driving you wanna do with it and then look into the shops that have gtrs that do that. its pretty straight foward honestly. you dont need ethanol for big power and shit out of those things. theyre beasts
[5:32:14] candycrush92: i play ret pally so couldn’t tell ya
[5:32:15] silviic: im rocking a 870hp bmw e30 with a twin turbo V8 xD
[5:32:22] allen_the_average_old_joe: Gotta get at least a couple games in fam they gave me the night off for crying out loud lol
[5:32:35] DontDv8: lol my brother tt his charger, now his shit breaks every week lol
[5:32:44] jguidera: Affinity Automotive... Its near you
[5:32:47] the_boogalorian: most shops that have the means to do those things have a tuner available or you can work with a tuner online
[5:32:53] EeVeTV: @Pikabooirl I'd recommend giving ETS a call or email. they do custom tunes and they have world records for the EVO. They have some really quick GTRs as well
[5:32:57] fullsendru: what year is your gtr cause if it’s an older year getting it smogged every year or 2 is a bitch
[5:33:05] DontDv8: fuel pumps, tune issues, startes, over heating, its crazy
[5:33:20] arobahn: my 2025 pores turbo 1400 to wheels I never broke down
[5:33:31] candycrush92: @starr2000 prob rings
[5:33:34] silviic: ecumaster the best ECU for tuning by far, but you need to check what ECU's you find a tunner for!
[5:33:38] arobahn: Porsche
[5:33:38] GoSolarASAP: gtrs have a crazy big modding scene with hundreds of brands. don't get scammed by a california shop that overcharges 10X for shit cause they're everywhere
[5:34:46] remickzstrafez: here in Houston we got hella modded GTRS 😂
[5:34:50] 475nm: the GTR burble sounds heavenly with a nice exhaust
[5:34:51] syphonx23: There's got to be a reputable GTR shop on the west coast somewhere.
[5:35:04] xCarcin: !addons
[5:35:05] Nightbot: Gladius, TrufiGCD, Details, and Omnibar, Pika uses default UI for everything else
[5:35:23] TimmyShoes: what kinda cats are we talking about
[5:35:29] Armanous: yo, what's good
[5:35:40] DontDv8: also tuning in cali will always be tough, gotta go to under the table spot for smog
[5:35:40] pr0x365: Isn't it like 7-10k or something crazy like that for the clutches?
[5:35:41] EeVeTV: Their gtr is 3500 hp... trust me they know their shit lol
[5:35:50] jguidera: LOL MAFIA 4 LUFE!
[5:35:52] GoSolarASAP: @Pikabooirl do not go e85 route, will cost you $5-10K in mods and you don't daily your GTR, plus you got a GT3 and I'd drive that over a GTR for sure
[5:35:54] remickzstrafez: here in “Mexico”🤣
[5:36:00] syphonx23: E85 is a bitch because you have to test it every time you fill up. Cause if you get a bad batch it's no good
[5:36:06] fullsendru: I would say start simple and if it’s not enough for you then you can always go for more
[5:36:11] srrymyfingerslip: 3500hp the fuck?
[5:36:11] s4mboyzar: what addons do you use? @Pikabooirl
[5:36:23] jguidera: @Armanous hows mafia homie?
[5:36:23] mfwillie: wait till you have to deal with e85 cold starts lol
[5:36:40] EeVeTV: They reached 3500 back in 2018 on the gtr.
[5:36:41] pr0x365: @mfwillie All in the tuning
[5:36:45] GoSolarASAP: @Pikabooirl you'd have to update your clutches and transmissions for 1000hp+, GTRs are a hard ride it ain't worth it
[5:36:48] EeVeTV: 3500 hp*
[5:37:09] moistydank: you have a garage now man, you can start working on your car yourself lol why not ya know
[5:37:10] remickzstrafez: @srrymyfingerslip  highest GTR made roughly 3050 whp
[5:37:14] Armanous: @jguidera doing good. living life
[5:37:14] Ghettoqt: why would americans go for sportscar when they are not allowed to drive fast anyway
[5:37:16] Yukimes: it was probably Australian
[5:37:20] GoSolarASAP: cold air intakes, ECU tune, catless downpipes, and call it a day. you'll hear the turbo spool and have plenty of power @Pikabooirl
[5:37:24] remickzstrafez: no it’s 3050 WHP
[5:37:26] cheezypoofs1: pepeD
[5:37:29] s4mboyzar: @Pikabooirl Sadge
[5:37:32] 475nm: need 16 tires to put that power to the ground wtf
[5:37:35] EeVeTV: ETS built - English Racing driven
