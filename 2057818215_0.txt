[0:49:45] therealanticx: nuke them from orbit
[0:49:45] taylorsdank: WHOA
[0:49:45] crackerssx: 2 weeks at the start hurts though
[0:49:46] bt_lyger: 2 weeks and they lose all items / gear

[0:49:54] jacksunson: if you ban for 3 months they aint coming back
[0:49:54] Diddly_dope: perma
[0:49:54] uwu2022: they want players to return
[0:49:54] keredj: No reason to buy gold now
[0:49:57] Jpermuy: 2 WEEKS 1RTS TIME PERMA SECOND
[0:49:57] robertoox92: what about us that never did one and got that message
[0:49:58] niall_9: 2 weeks at the start of P2 is decent
[0:49:59] ThePlayerCoachStun: if they do it again its a perma ban
[0:49:59] minnymuffins: dont want to lose that monthly sub
[0:49:59] xQ_Qx: We need to take their pointer fingers @Xaryu
[0:50:00] Diddly_dope: 6 months
[0:50:00] silverskum: 2 weeks seems reasonable
[0:50:00] thesirganks: if they make it perma or multiple months sod players just get a new account instead

[0:50:00] Vichrinox: would you say that to Soda?
[0:50:01] Ervill1: its fine for first offence...
[0:50:01] bryn_dee: But that's a two week ban at the start of a phase
[0:50:04] Guydx: 2 weeks right now is pretty painful
[0:50:05] funboix0x0: everything gone
[0:50:05] berserage95: what are people buying gold for LU
[0:50:09] Phoenix3215: 2 weeks is enough for a first offense,  half their sub month
[0:50:11] Thetacoeater007: missing out on launch hurts
[0:50:13] bryn_dee: It's super painful to be suspended first 2 weeks of the phase
[0:50:16] Diddly_dope: not until phase 3 hahahaha
[0:50:16] aquilas100: risk will be a not paying customer
[0:50:16] fellifell: yo xar 50 gifted for 200g??? xarW
[0:50:23] teamkillgreg: buying gold is good for Blizzard, it's in their best interest to have it. This is a marketing / PR play.
[0:50:23] Meltim: @Guydx not enough tbh, not sure about perma but it should be more
[0:50:25] Shailax: @thesirganks which means more money for blizzard = good
[0:50:26] 1teuzin: maybe it should be 1 month as first warning
[0:50:29] CroTV: so streamers that are accepting the free gold should also be banned or slapped on the wrist? thoughts?
[0:50:30] mr_az3k: Mitch KEKW

[0:50:48] keredj: Trust
[0:50:49] Guydx: yeah same
[0:50:50] werign: they will not sub if it is more than 1 Month. 2 Weeks are perfekt because they will pay for this month and the next
[0:50:50] heylowdub: should be perma ip ban and any streamers that do it sohuld be banned from making wow content
[0:50:50] Towenaar2: Kappa
[0:50:51] psyduke69: soda

[0:51:12] Noxwarr: LS (big League of Legends personality) got suspended this morning too after apparently only getting gold from death rolling
[0:51:13] Aerah99: that is pretty much buying gold KEKW
[0:51:16] mcgitches: the people trading lots of gold are probably the same people as selling it
[0:51:16] belvedee: They can't lol
[0:51:16] keelew: Susge he didn't guy gold tho
[0:51:19] Emerno: ban both, EZ
[0:51:21] funboix0x0: Blizzard doesn't care LULW
[0:51:22] Cjpriest: they dont they just ban you regardless
[0:51:24] Valvax: did he buy gold in wrath though? LUL
[0:51:26] Etheom: Blizz is the gold sellers EZ
[0:51:26] Tukinik: they cant, so everyone gets banned
[0:51:26] BreksMT: just dont do it
[0:51:26] ShadoHC: ban em all
[0:51:27] jaredfrasas93: well that shouldn’t be allowed anyway
[0:51:27] uwu2022: bad trading
[0:51:27] Cjpriest: happened to me a few weeks ago
[0:51:27] garzzyy: no way they care enough to look into that
[0:51:28] Vichrinox: they dont, they jsut ban
[0:51:28] hearthledgerlol: They check the accounts trading
[0:51:29] juice42069: trading gold over those games is prob against tos
[0:51:30] thandelmtj: I mean you have communitys that sell boosts by gold managed by arabians, they are the advertisers  make around 5 mil per day and sell that on overgear
[0:51:30] CroTV: so streamers that are accepting the free gold should also be banned or slapped on the wrist? thoughts?
[0:51:31] Rhymm: you cant
[0:51:32] doctor_anoos: It's all automated @Xaryu
[0:51:32] BreksMT: why would you want to transfer gold like that?
[0:51:33] niall_9: I thought gold between realms is fair
[0:51:34] drakeeatscakes: you shouldnt be able to do that either
[0:51:34] crackerssx: dont think u cna
[0:51:35] Elvandel: Jusr earn the gold in the game you play!!!!
[0:51:35] MrZestie: youre putting too much thought in blizzard actually caring about that
[0:51:36] lethalkingr: guys mage rogue or hunter for phase 2?
[0:51:36] hearthledgerlol: Age of accounts , level of characters
[0:51:44] jacksunson: No more big p2p gold trades, its simple
[0:51:44] nexu__: its the accounts that trade gold to the customers, they track that @Xaryu
[0:51:44] malvarcla: I cant wait to go undercover in secret GDKPs and report all of you mofos
[0:51:46] berserage95: with gdkps banned who cares if people buy gold, u can pug raid now
[0:51:49] anuel214: They really need to remove gold from mmos
[0:51:52] archer2342: @Xaryu one of our officers was trading his Wrath gold for SOD gold and got banned until end of month
[0:51:54] Meltim: I mean as long as any gold didnt get aquired by buying/selling/botting it should be fine?
[0:51:55] Unfeatured: player to player gold swaps aren't sanctioned by Blizzard and I think most of us know that anyone "trading" gold knows the gold on SoD was purchased
[0:51:55] tou0four: i feel like there's a way, they would just have to do a little more investigating
[0:51:59] SpaceCowboy0811: yea sure, or they are all full of shit
[0:52:02] hearthledgerlol: @archer2342 nah he was buying gold OMEGALUL
[0:52:06] juice42069: dont send massive amounts of gold ever lol

[0:52:09] CodeCrisp: cry
[0:52:10] crackerssx: i guess just dont allow trade either
[0:52:11] Meltim: Track the source
[0:52:14] nexu__: its more complex than that
[0:52:17] archer2342: @hearthledgerlol nah he's got the logs
[0:52:17] toddypoo: the gold he “traded” for was botted gold
[0:52:17] belvedee: Guess they just go outside for two weeks lol.
[0:52:19] ShadoHC: BAN EM ALL
[0:52:21] Duckacubed: Idk....dont' buy gold. period
[0:52:21] Diddly_dope: wont see mitch for a while
[0:52:21] DeathToad007: shouldnt have bought gold
[0:52:22] berserage95: only reason gold buying sucked was cause the gold was used in raids, now gdkp is banned who really cares
[0:52:23] Vichrinox: Imagine going buying an item form someone and they trade you bought gold...
[0:52:23] sekcmexi99: I got caught and i cant do anything about it. apparenlty the person i traded an item and he was a gold buy so i got banned.
[0:52:25] Etheom: i guess thats why mitch isnt online modCheck
[0:52:26] Dinomight3: there's a reason why mitch isn't on rn
[0:52:28] kirk_hunts: Ban every player imo.
[0:52:29] realandtruephobe: your friend bought gold
[0:52:29] BreksMT: trading gold between games is still shady af
[0:52:30] vmaster11: he shouldnt have broken ToS
[0:52:30] hearthledgerlol: Bro they can check account age and levels on accounts. THey can tell if its a trading account / bot account lol
[0:52:31] anuel214: Sounds like mitch
[0:52:32] scooops555: I mean trading gold between launches is gold buying
[0:52:32] funboix0x0: Wait for P3 LULW
[0:52:32] thandelmtj: I mean you have communitys that sell boosts by gold managed by arabians, they are the advertisers  make around 5 mil per day and sell that on overgear, theres always a way to turn around lol
[0:52:33] Vichrinox: i cant type for some reason
[0:52:34] Hydro1904: You gonna be the tiny violen of GDKP
[0:52:34] Whitemamba236: I bet blizzard is scared to ban someone by mistake for 6 months so they are doing 2 weeks
[0:52:34] PMA_1: start again
[0:52:34] DeathToad007: get fucked
[0:52:35] Diddly_dope: pika
[0:52:36] CroTV: Streamers accepting gold from viewers should be banned.
[0:52:36] Elvandel: Sell everything through AH. No player to player trading
[0:52:36] DuckTwelve: and its already over! gnomer cleared
[0:52:37] Scottyboy_97: p2 is over
[0:52:39] toddypoo: it’s called guilty by association
[0:52:40] IrrelevntElephnt: god i wish it was mitch getting banned
[0:52:40] badillwwjoe: your friend is still buying gold, but different currency
[0:52:40] kirk_hunts: Every player with a gold should be banned.
[0:52:41] juice42069: it take 8 hours to get max lvl
[0:52:43] Madmaxx777: also pretty dumb since the wrath gold was bought directly from blizzard lol. hard ethical line for them to try to toe, and obviously a bit silly
[0:52:43] Shunmao: not mitch because he does buy gold
[0:52:44] CodeCrisp: hahahahhaa mitch banned
[0:52:44] vmaster11: dont buy gold, dont get banned. EZ
[0:52:47] luxxen1: That happened back too in legion EU when they went after BG botters, they had to unban a lot of players cause they found out they made the mistake @Xaryu
[0:52:50] Elvandel: payeers cannot trade gold. Only items
[0:52:53] Whotzari: ofc he did no offence
[0:52:56] archer2342: @vmaster11 tos doesn't say you can't trade gold in this form
[0:52:59] twobrat: He does though, you could advocate for him
[0:53:06] Udenwo: sardaco got banned for 2 weeks too (2 weeks ago) and didn't buy gold
[0:53:07] trmonx: if you are a gold buyer better have many accs and split characters lmao
[0:53:09] TrumpWallWorker: His incentive is to utilize your platform to get unbanned
[0:53:09] davidbjugis: your frind lied to you AND bought gold?
[0:53:12] neoseoul69: "Ethan" bought gold and gave it to Mitch
[0:53:12] hearthledgerlol: They can check accounts man they arent just blindly banning. The accounts trading bought gold are bot accounts with no max level characters etc
[0:53:14] ShadoHC: just dont do any transfer
[0:53:15] N4A5T: i imagine transferring gold from one version of the game to another is still against tos
[0:53:15] DuckTwelve: mmmm good point

[0:53:27] berserage95: can a gold buyer tell us what hes buying gold for in p2?
[0:53:30] Madmaxx777: if they had integrity, they would. but it’s a company, so they will not lol
[0:53:33] ReallyThough: based xaryu
[0:53:33] Kenpachii92: he bought sod gold for wotlk gold, and you cant buy gold in sod. just dont trade in ways that are not allowed in game
[0:53:35] garzzyy: let him cook
[0:53:37] Meltim: At least not add token to sod/classic+
[0:53:41] MrZestie: thats why i said before, Banning people for buying gold is rich WHEN THEY SELL GOLD THEMSELVES
[0:53:42] Etheom: wow token is #1 worst decision ever made
[0:53:43] Jpermuy: $$$$4

[0:53:50] ThePlayerCoachStun: @Xaryu if they get banned again its a perma though thats enough to make people not do it again
[0:53:50] Nonprophetx: theyre making so much off it dude
[0:53:50] mcgitches: i dont care what happens on the wrath servers. just get rid of trading
[0:53:50] Etheom: share holders $$$$$$$$$$$
[0:53:50] Jensath: ye

[0:53:54] Fearmyrage_: no
[0:53:54] sobakavolk: add token to sod is the solution
[0:53:54] solleyes: YES
[0:53:54] toddypoo: no the gold he got on sod was the problem and most likely dirty gold
[0:53:55] Rowser172: 100%
[0:53:55] limburgse: nooooooo
[0:53:56] jvizzey: theres a TOKEN in SOD??

[0:53:58] Shailax: no
[0:53:58] limburgse: i hate it
[0:53:59] graziNNN: I like the WoW token
[0:54:00] jsonlee7: some people do gold trading from retail to classic or vice versa that doesnt involve RMT. Maybe that is against the rules but I dont know.
[0:54:00] Jpermuy: people that want to p2w
[0:54:00] vak_hunt: They claim it helps the economy kekw

[0:54:08] NocturnusXIV: nope
[0:54:08] keredj: never used it
[0:54:09] neoseoul69: The token is like making drugs leagal. People are going to buy gold no matter what make it safe and "tax" it
[0:54:09] thewilq2: I come back to WoW when they remove token and kill bots
[0:54:09] Timmytentoes44: no not worth
[0:54:09] teezboi: retail yes
[0:54:09] Lyzle: hell no

[0:54:56] Nonprophetx: was it a first offense ban though? dont have to perma ban on a first offense
[0:54:57] keredj: No incentive for buying gold now

[0:58:04] jimtheplumber207: I love Thor though. he makes a lot of good points. this one not so much

[3:33:21] xephur: @askinforit given that it was I think 1g? I would hope that it could be used anywhere. based on what he did during that event, it would take 25 events to save up just for the mount.

[5:55:20] kekailani_: should you ever use max rank frost bolt now
[5:55:20] notcoolhimbo: Teams will camp by the rez and murder solos, my first event was rough
[5:55:24] berserage95: hopefully it lasts cause stv is a big zone
[5:55:24] roztoky: Hmmm maybe a candidate for next pvp group - Akacia?
[5:55:25] SelWrynn: So this event makes PvP in the zone fully FFA and u get as many coins as you get kills?
[5:55:26] starboyleb: ur like 2 feet in stv lol
[5:55:26] xCEvans: that sounded sarcatic but i dont think it was
[5:55:32] wazza76: so its not alliance v horde then?

[5:56:00] thewal1ofsleep: if it's a free for all, were you just getting healed there?
[5:56:01] kapitoldenim: should be no groups at all
[5:56:02] chattersomegalul: @xCEvans that's why sarcasm is the absolute best form of communication
[5:56:04] falconsfan777: do you mind explaining how it works? sorry if you have before. the pvp zone
[5:56:14] thewal1ofsleep: oh you're in a 5man grp
[5:56:17] Breakfist_: i think FFA is weird af tho

[5:57:09] Chordgaille: No they didn't lmao. Such a bad event
[5:57:12] berserage95: give it a couple days
[5:57:12] Bambambm: Blizz got it wrong, GY camping at altars ruins it. Slight tweaks and itll be great though
[5:57:14] rpkxnoscope57: lol true
[5:57:16] zen0vae: xar sees pile of horde SSSsss SSSsss SSSsss  AOE BABY

[5:57:27] frenchcataphract: @Xaryu @acaciashrub
[5:57:30] V4LD5S: why tho?
[5:57:31] avaell_: bro this event is awful if ur a healer wtf am i supposedf to do
[5:57:32] MongoSecurity: That's a great idea
[5:57:33] catbalou2: How does STV work on a normal server?...the whole reason people are there is they dont want "forced" PVP
[5:57:35] monoboxtv: No, 1 zone is perfect >:(

[5:57:50] Witality: dying Kapp
[5:57:51] Modain: STV works bettter
[5:57:51] DaStorminator: graveyard farm meta
[5:57:51] monoboxtv: I wanna learn every wall, every jump
[5:57:52] berserage95: im gonna sound like a hater but its a zone turned pvp with a currency instead of honor that just buys gear, its nothing special
[5:57:53] zokkaa: TI SI DECKO DEBIL
[5:57:53] 1stblood1995: losing a stack when you die is just kinda cringe
[5:57:53] RedChaosTV: in all three zones at the same time, to many people in the same place
[5:57:55] Chordgaille: Make it faction based
[5:57:56] SelWrynn: Thematically STV makes sense becausr ZG & Hakkar
[5:57:57] kenzellbtw: grouping is annoying asf in pvp tbh
[5:57:57] kb645: GY farm meta
[5:57:57] Breakfist_: i dont like the FFA aspect
[5:57:57] larnsmarf: he cant be a zergling
[5:57:58] yellowgaiden: people bitching about solo play
[5:58:00] chasingshadowsz: not enough dicks

[5:58:04] zen0vae: says the guy getting farmed

[5:58:08] ironmouse34: i'm the old guy that doesn't like to pvp anymore
[5:58:08] Dionxdalai: solo play is impossible
[5:58:12] ichigoichin: Gy farm is scuffed
[5:58:15] HelluvaWrecks: solo players dont like it
[5:58:16] WaffletheMan101: i just wish there was a bit of a map hazard to keep groups moving
[5:58:17] iglokott: what do the blood do?
[5:58:18] starboyleb: farm meta gonna go crazy\
[5:58:19] kekailani_: Nah that sounds like a headache to navigate where to zone is gonna be
[5:58:20] Jayko337: yup so no more steam rolling over groups
[5:58:21] Austuhnnn: 5 is still too much imo
[5:58:22] V4LD5S: 5 is still anoying
[5:58:24] MongoSecurity: Tanaris/Gadgetzan would be perfect imo as another hotspot.  Back in the day that is where we all hung out
[5:58:25] Nimbus723: you pretty much have to be in a group of 5 though right?
[5:58:26] flace01: less than solo, impressive
[5:58:26] djrn1: can you give a quick rundown of the event?
[5:58:26] Bambambm: @Xaryu Just corpse camping Atlars for EASY win-trading is ruining the event tbh. Kills need heavy diminshing returns, and a buff for extra blood the further away from an altar you are.
[5:58:30] onerigtorulethemall: solo only
[5:58:30] Spooksters: probably wont be a lot of solo players in STV, this will be full 5 man groups
[5:58:33] catbalou2: On a Normal server it should br OPT IN...not OPT OUT
[5:58:37] Yodo123: what is the red debuff during blod moon?
[5:58:38] Spooksters: grouping at ALL should punish you
[5:58:39] Chordgaille: In faction combat is the by far the most stupid thing blizz could've done to the event
[5:58:39] Spooksters: solo or bust
[5:58:48] berserage95: i love graveyard camping in a 20 year old game that had additions to stop camping but they cant figure it out again LUL
[5:58:59] ZerfOG: acting like finding 4 ppl to grp with is hard lmfao
[5:59:00] Movu: It's also awesome to watch
[5:59:00] espi: solo would be L
[5:59:02] An7ido7e: 3's would be nice

[5:59:03] itsSooon: definitely l
[5:59:03] Yamamoto78: 3 mans
[5:59:06] wispxlol: 3 would be W
[5:59:06] An7ido7e: 3 mans
[5:59:07] LilTaisu: like absolutely insnae
[5:59:07] kenzellbtw: disc/holy priest is S tier
[5:59:07] Spooksters: maybe 1-3 then?
[5:59:10] NosfeRAtu0202: If horde can kill horde and alliance can kill alliance, why cant Horde and Alliance party up?
[5:59:11] conbarz: have a solo only mini zone
[5:59:12] V4LD5S: 3 mans
[5:59:12] 808polska: Xaryu & chat, whats the name of the Bulletin board addon everyone uses? wanna try it on EU
[5:59:12] LilTaisu: big blizzard L tbh
[5:59:13] SyndicateGaming2: 3's would be fair
[5:59:16] yellowgaiden: its not apex legends
[5:59:17] zin_panda: This mode is sick solo would be worse
[5:59:18] 1stblood1995: yea idk man this is awful solo like absolutely horrible
[5:59:19] EJEazy_: solo only is just ganking
[5:59:21] Renriak: Solo is fun because you can run around and pick people off that aren't focusing on you in these bigger skirmishes

[5:59:50] HB12: timer to you cant at rez
[5:59:50] Bambambm: @Xaryu Just corpse camping Atlars for EASY win-trading is ruining the event tbh. Kills need heavy diminshing returns, and a buff for extra blood the further away from an altar you are.

[6:00:30] Maiqthehighking: phase 2 hype
[6:00:30] Bambambm: @Xaryu Needs HEAVY diminishing returns tbh for blood on kills
[6:00:32] GallowayOW: this is all people do
[6:00:32] grantgatz: immunity for like 30 seconds
[6:00:33] Chordgaille: @808polska LFG group bulletin board
[6:00:33] paradoxyy: @Xaryu make it so after release 30 sec u don t give coins

[6:00:40] bigwilly3737: phase 2 hype lol this is an L
[6:00:41] hamon321: that's.... so dumb
[6:00:41] An7ido7e: thats an L for party play though (random porting)
[6:00:42] DeadBesidE: You get more than you lose this way
[6:00:43] larnsmarf: no way these guys have been makin video games for this long. and this shit still happens
[6:00:44] chattersomegalul: just unflag rather than immunity
[6:00:46] tookstaa: run back to your body - but its 200yards

[6:00:51] Harthad: too good to be true
[6:00:52] catbalou2: PVE andys have a right to complain...they join a normal server to not have forced PVP
[6:00:54] snyderbyte: Make it a res "circle" with 100yd radius
[6:00:55] larnsmarf: how do they not understand what degens gamers are?
[6:00:56] zyydron: You can go to a different respawn
[6:00:56] berserage95: blizz will "fix it" in a couple days and everyone will say blizzard is the best
[6:00:56] Klaymen_: for sure there should be a timer that goes up the more you die, like normal rezz
[6:00:57] ShakyIncision: Just have it give no rewards in the immediate vicinity.
[6:00:59] GallowayOW: you also get more blood than you lose so theres no downside to just keep rezzing and aoeing
[6:01:00] Witality: so lets revoke the statement that this is perfect KEKW

[6:03:42] muzzwow: random respawn or respawn from the air and u come in like fortnite XD
[6:03:43] TheHighAvenger: Just set a range around the gy where you cant attack.
[6:03:43] MongoSecurity: Just like the Epic BG's GY.
[6:03:44] JLuu4: @Xaryu if you wait a bit to release i think you get a brez option
[6:03:44] Grosmurdefeu: Bloodless target for x sec after rez
[6:03:45] JJGold: safezone
[6:03:47] Kiergray: make gy's protected cant farm

[6:03:49] Bluebunnyboy: Zepher or Airplane that everyone rezes on and u jump down into the battle
[6:03:50] CesarGaming: What about an Ashran Immune bubble in a large radius
[6:03:50] berserage95: remember wsg and wg back in the day had this problem and they fixed it
[6:03:51] Ayjayyy: make them give dishonerable kills for 20 seconds lol
[6:03:52] realandtruephobe: just respawn at corpse
[6:03:54] gandiisawse: so messy
[6:03:54] conbarz: looks like a shit show
[6:03:54] HB12: one way graveyard, that once talked to will TP you somewhere on the zone
[6:03:55] shadowfigure3: dishonorable kill if with in vicinity of gy
[6:03:55] drewshamu: grave yard silences you
[6:03:56] tellvanni: so ridiculous
[6:03:57] crownhs: Deaths lose you 5 blood, cant give nor yield blood first 30sec, cant attack nor defend first 30sec
[6:03:58] radish63: if the radius is large u good
[6:03:59] classygamer17: yea the gy is bad bad not good for the game
[6:03:59] nintoz: random gy spawn
[6:04:03] thatsrealneeto: Maybe honorless for 30 seconds
[6:04:03] Hiebly: no graveyard, rez on body only
[6:04:04] lancerr987: or how about no graveyards and you can just spawn wherever
[6:04:05] qrenozzz: not suprised at all that this pvp event is completely scuffed i fkn knew it
[6:04:09] Reapersghost501: random graveyard respawn rotation
[6:04:10] karatebaws: bro you are getting farmed
[6:04:11] dkamm17: just need people to camp the campers
[6:04:11] Kosmonaut23: yep
[6:04:12] muzzwow: airdrop of respawns from griffins
[6:04:13] GallowayOW: what about random spawns
[6:04:13] papaotter: just dont give blood around graveyard
[6:04:14] insertysz: why not sickness ?
[6:04:14] solanar1139: Immunity on rez for 20s or until you attack
[6:04:14] adam_brisbane: like they have on the BG
[6:04:17] berserage95: how did devs not see this coming?
[6:04:19] kamutef: someone suggested a bg that is battle royal like, where every bg u start with bad gear e.g. and then you would get better gear and fight in a free for all environment. thoughts?
[6:04:21] kenzellbtw: everyone is just grouping
[6:04:22] WaffletheMan101: yeah no blood for GY kills
[6:04:22] MongoSecurity: Not if those inside the GY could kill those camping it lol.
[6:04:23] espi: people would dance around teh bubble edge
[6:04:23] Octagon3: faction gys and npc guards
[6:04:24] Origotoshi: No
[6:04:26] Hiebly: no
[6:04:27] Chiphazzord: but once you leave u cant reenter
[6:04:27] snackpackqt: once you res you have 15-20 secs of immunity and people can’t get blood from you. that way once you res you have some time to run away and spread out
[6:04:29] weber510: no rez sickness during event?
[6:04:30] crownhs: solid, yup
[6:04:30] goofey: i think the mulitple random GYs would be better
[6:04:32] meswearshewas18: like battle of gilneas , it has one there
[6:04:32] Glorimonkey: basically one of 10 different solutions blizz didnt think about lmao
[6:04:34] Bluebunnyboy: Airplane rez point that flys around STV!
[6:04:38] morfius09: you are not worth any blood or can get blood for 30 sec after revival
[6:04:39] JLuu4: can you wait a sec to release after death
[6:04:39] Chordgaille: Bring back raid groups. Take out free for all. If it's not broke don't fix it. Zzzzzz
[6:04:39] menoog: i think a timed immunity after rez is the best solution
[6:04:39] berserage95: @kamutef this is an mmo...................................
[6:04:41] realandtruephobe: Hey Xar just FYI you cna respawn at corpse
[6:04:42] Dreadmodex: Maybe make spawning random, so you can literally spawn almost anywhere
[6:04:42] daijahaden: Or just give "bloodless" kills for an amount of time after ressing at gy
[6:04:44] bigwilly3737: this is a huge L ngl
[6:04:45] stromm327: there's another rez spirit by turn in spot
[6:04:47] emrysdb: Like in wintergrasp
[6:04:47] radish63: corpse walk
[6:04:49] Dratel: you cant rez on body?
[6:04:49] Mr_NeonCloud: Run to your corpse
[6:04:49] jgarcia95az: no blood for first 10-15 seconds
[6:04:49] petedelete2019: JUST RUN TO BODY @Xaryu
[6:04:52] WaffletheMan101: no blood for GY kills
[6:04:52] kenzellbtw: res at your body my guy
[6:04:53] kbbqboi: You can pvp in booty bay and that graveyard is empty as fuck
[6:04:53] napparandre: Lame
[6:04:53] Zanketsuk3n: find another chain angel
[6:04:53] Modain: Just revive on corpse
[6:04:54] Schmidtrs12: This is awful lol
[6:04:55] JJGold: run to ur body
[6:04:55] ZerfOG: rez at body no?
[6:04:56] Origotoshi: If you can't beat em, join em
[6:04:56] Unusual_Steeze: you cant run to your body?
[6:04:57] starboyleb: this doesnt seem like it tbh
[6:04:57] NutterCircus: Easy kills
[6:04:57] FearNoEvilx: @Xaryu u can just walk and rez at anotehr healer, there are more between turn in points
[6:04:58] blazzedzz: This looks super fun lol
[6:04:59] taplataimo: this is perfect pvp :)
[6:04:59] Maldre: event is good :)
[6:04:59] DirtyDan1659: Seems like there has to be a better way to handle rezzing
[6:05:01] Chordgaille: @bigwilly3737 massive L is understatement
[6:05:02] NosfeRAtu0202: there are many spirits on the main road
[6:05:04] frenchcataphract: meat grinder
[6:05:04] sum1thatplaysgames: Collusion
[6:05:04] Zanketsuk3n: you can death walk to another rez point
[6:05:07] kamutef: run to body?
[6:05:09] Kosmonaut23: ppl would use the immunity somehow.  maybe you lose the being immune for a set amount of time
[6:05:10] ZerfOG: can you not rez on body?
[6:05:11] medaros7: you can ghost run to other spirit to ress near altar
[6:05:14] realdevv: Just dont get farmed
[6:05:15] NosfeRAtu0202: you dont have to res ata the same point all the timne
[6:05:15] sum1thatplaysgames: prolly a guild group of 5 man teams just  farming gy
[6:05:15] Modain: Corpse Run
[6:05:17] MitoriSama: run to ur body no? @Xaryu
[6:05:18] berserage95: if only the wow devs had some sort of old content they could look at to see how to fix the problem they already fixed 15 years ago :(
[6:05:19] petedelete2019: RUN TO CORPSE? @Xaryu
[6:05:19] Filuuren: People that just ressed get a new ability that one shots everyone within 40yards. Can only be used once and only inside the GY
[6:05:20] detourz28: Lol the first time it was cool and now everyone figured out camping this and makes it seem lame
[6:05:20] Travisaurusrex: dont play alliance LOL
[6:05:21] snackpackqt: or if you kill someone who’s ress’d within a certain amount of time it takes bloods away from you kinda like dishonorable kills
[6:05:22] stenei1821: what is happening?
[6:05:26] WaffletheMan101: this is at every GY btw
[6:05:27] starboyleb: this will just be a farm fest with 0 purpose im afraid
[6:05:29] medaros7: XAVIX READ
[6:05:30] GallowayOW: this is what has happened everytime ive gone to stv
[6:05:31] NosfeRAtu0202: THERE ARE MANY SPIRITS ON THE MAIN ROAD
[6:05:32] aemsilain: can anyone tell me why xar is not losing any blood?
[6:05:32] JJGold: nope
[6:05:33] Modain: Better then being farmed
[6:05:33] Enkaelol: no ress time
[6:05:36] ZerfOG: nope
[6:05:36] hahashockd: THERES RES SPOTS ALL OVER THE MAP.....
[6:05:37] menoog: waiting is worth waiting either way...
[6:05:38] realandtruephobe: its the way to get out of GY
[6:05:40] beingg0d: yo this wb is kinda useless for melee/hunter
[6:05:41] prismo5: there are other spirits around the zone
[6:05:41] medaros7: RUN TO OTHER SPIRIT WHILE IN GHOST
[6:05:46] kamutef: guess thats their countermeasure
[6:05:49] Nebulas2: should res to full heath to
[6:05:52] TacoN64: LUL
[6:05:54] Skeetin_: if your lvl 40 you definitely live in your moms basement and are fat af
[6:05:57] NosfeRAtu0202: There are many spirits on the main road that can res u
[6:05:57] Chordgaille: So funny that people think is a good event
[6:05:57] kenzellbtw: they're all grouping is the issue
[6:05:58] NutterCircus: OH THE HUMANITY! FailFish
[6:05:59] avaell_: this is worse than ashenvale lkmao
[6:05:59] shadowfigure3: make it so yea sure you can kill in gy but it’s dishonorable and you’ll down rank.
[6:06:02] MongoSecurity: All those damn Night Elves
[6:06:03] bigwilly3737: anyone who says this is good is copium
[6:06:06] ironmouse34: and this is why I am on a pve server LOL
[6:06:07] conbarz: dog shit
[6:06:12] kenzellbtw: the issue is that everyone is grouping
[6:06:13] realandtruephobe: @bigwilly3737 I'm loving it.
[6:06:13] Enkaelol: @Xaryu whats the script you run to avoid the spirit effects on your screen?
[6:06:15] vAtsokk: 1-10, how good is the pvp?
[6:06:15] aIighieri: a powerful npc killing everyone that have no been resurrected in the last 20 seconds might solve
[6:06:16] ZerfOG: different gy?
[6:06:16] crownhs: Immune bubble is enough.
[6:06:19] furesway: If you dont die, you can't get GY camped. :o
[6:06:20] brainrot_behavior: wait STV is FFA?! I'm so screwed
[6:06:22] berserage95: just put an immunity like retail has had for 20 years
[6:06:22] WaffletheMan101: just no blood
[6:06:23] Clarkn5: Give every rezz a stealth buff
[6:06:23] Chordgaille: @vatsokk 1
[6:06:26] edeleon33133: @Xaryu Why not multiple ghosts and you can select which ghost to res at?
[6:06:29] bottis96: if you are at Graveyard should give you buff so you could kill campers
[6:06:29] Bluebunnyboy: Airplane rez point that you jump off of.
[6:06:31] moogy_moog: would it be too out there of an idea to have a general, semi widespread area where you 'random rez' in some spot in that general area?
[6:06:32] CivilTX: No combat zone 100 yds from graveyard
[6:06:33] snackpackqt: people will camp the immunity bubble edge though
[6:06:36] provender_: A bunch of normal GYs, have people run to body!
[6:06:36] sheltereddougy: should be diminishing returns on killing same player over and over too like regular honor
[6:06:36] bigwilly3737: @whitewatersalvo you must have never played a good pvp game this is trash lol
[6:06:37] Lacidmn: just no blood
[6:06:38] NosfeRAtu0202: You can revive at an of the many spirits along the road
[6:06:38] kamutef: but only immunity to pvp damage
[6:06:39] SuaSponte: just make you lose all stacks if you kill someone near the graveyard, no reason anyone should be there
[6:06:39] baileyyalexx: it would have to be that you can't attack either
[6:06:40] Bimo94: Immune to any damage for 3 weeks.
[6:06:40] espi: that wouldnt fix anything
[6:06:41] Enkaelol: @Xaryu whats the script you run to avoid the spirit effects on your screen??
[6:06:44] kamutef: otherwise u could abuse it
[6:06:44] WaffletheMan101: @Xaryu just make it so you get no blood for GY kills
[6:06:45] Kyousiik: Should have immunity for 30 secs - 1 min, to allow people to get distance.
[6:06:47] Modain: Only to pvp damage
[6:06:47] catbalou2: The event is just chaos..it will get old fast
[6:06:49] WaffletheMan101: people wont want to camp it
[6:06:52] berserage95: @espi thats what they did on retail and literally fixed it LUL
[6:06:53] gd_azduel: or you just dont give blood for 20s after rez
[6:06:53] espi: it would just delay 20s...
[6:06:56] HB12: give no blood around a zone of the graveyard
[6:06:58] jacksunson: it wuld 100% hlep
[6:06:58] realandtruephobe: @bigwilly3737 Or people just disagree one what makes things fun. Sorry you can't enjoy it :)
[6:07:00] kamutef: someone suggested a bg that is battle royal like, where every bg u start with bad gear e.g. and then you would get better gear and fight in a free for all environment. thoughts?
[6:07:01] cakerdoodles: also would b hype as you run out from zone as buff fades
[6:07:02] Yeddamand: Maybe also bodyrez at like 80% hp and mana would help? Then people who want to fight has a better chanse if they do run out
[6:07:05] EfeGamii: or when u die teleport anywhere in stv
[6:07:06] Chordgaille: @enkaelol depends on if he's using a script or leatrix plus. Leatrix plus has the script built in so a lot of people use that
[6:07:11] whoswatching: 20 sec is way to long
[6:07:11] bloodstuck2000: They just follow you lol
[6:07:11] butlerlog: literally just move the rez ghosts away from the graveyard so there are fewer people alive at any given time
[6:07:11] espi: you'd spend your 20s pumping dmg?
[6:07:12] justplaingodly: justplaingodly subscribed with Prime. 
[6:07:13] Daddycool_B: any type of immunity whilst you can move can lead to extreme abuse
[6:07:14] Dodoasa562: @Xaryu what is that skull buff?
[6:07:15] snackpackqt: it gives you some time to get distance and get back to party/group
[6:07:17] MongoSecurity: waddlesuwu
[6:07:17] berserage95: we have proof on retail it works, look at wsg and wg back in the day compared to now
[6:07:26] Yamamoto78: put lvl 60 goblin guards at the gy that attack anyone who hits in the area with nets and all @Xaryu
[6:07:28] NutterCircus: RIP
[6:07:30] bigwilly3737: @whitewatersalvo people spam killing you as you spawn over and over again is fun? LUL  keep coping
[6:07:31] chattersomegalul: more spirit healers
[6:07:36] moogy_moog: random spawn pops no gy? idk
[6:07:37] Daddycool_B: just a 100y non PvP area around GY such as shatter or dalaran
[6:07:42] Modain: Turn your blood in
[6:07:51] Bluebunnyboy: @Xaryu graveyard be on an airplane with combat disabled, then you parachute off and brawl.
[6:07:57] Chordgaille: @whitewatersalvo this guy thinks free for all combat is a win OMEGALUL
[6:07:58] Enkaelol: @Xaryu whats the script you run to avoid the spirit effects on your screen?
[6:08:00] kenzellbtw: fix graveyard/remove grouping and its solid
[6:08:01] berserage95: its honestly hard to look at this shit in a positive light when they keep making the same mistakes from retail
[6:08:03] hasbucks: lik
[6:08:04] kamutef: someone suggested a bg that is battle royal like, where every bg u start with bad gear e.g. and then you would get better gear and fight in a free for all environment. thoughts?-
[6:08:04] Willdownn: Yo! what is the aim at p2?
[6:08:07] NosfeRAtu0202: raid groups when some1 gets a kill it gives that player a debuff for -5% stats
[6:08:10] hasbucks: they took this from D4
[6:08:12] heyitsdrewx: yeah, GY aside, this is probably one of the most well designed pvp events
[6:08:14] balduar101: he will it when hes ready im sure
[6:08:15] realandtruephobe: @bigwilly3737 What is your problem man? I didn't get spawn camped over and over again lol, I ran to my corpse...
[6:08:17] Zynotlive: you can only hit the graveyard from the back ez fix
[6:08:17] menoog: what's the max level rn
[6:08:19] coolcoolcool777dood: simple fix, just tell people to quit attacking at the GY...
[6:08:19] kindaopmusic: or make it were you can spawn right at ur body
[6:08:21] Camosurfer21: make it so that it teleports you to different grave yards or the wandering revivers
[6:08:21] juddrybmmbytddcc: why is 90% of this chat not subbed??
[6:08:25] HB12: or have graveyard guards that will f you up if you fight near it
[6:08:27] Daddycool_B: read my@message before the one you just read
[6:08:28] butlerlog: a safe zone is pretty far from the spirit of the event
[6:08:28] Puskakana: We cool
[6:08:29] BobLongMVP: fuck me sideways imagine starsurge still being 42 yards holyyyyyyyyyy
[6:08:29] zVaall: i think if you dont want to pvp, leave the zone and stop trying add safespots
[6:08:31] NutterCircus: And Xar runs back to the GY LULW
[6:08:33] Chordgaille: @coolcoolcool777dood  why would I do that?
[6:08:36] Modain: Try another altar?
[6:08:37] Skeetin_: high lvl players aka virgins
[6:08:40] Enkaelol: @Xaryu whats the script you run to avoid the spirit effects on your screen?
[6:08:47] DontDv8: if its non pvp zone people will just camp it or run to escape
[6:08:47] bmillybmilly: 255
[6:08:47] XialdinSR: what about passive damage if you stay near the graveyard for too long after ressing
[6:08:49] realandtruephobe: @bigwilly3737 Sorry you couldn't get out of the GY :)
[6:08:55] PapaPoggo: so is this like a team death match essentially?
[6:09:07] Lacidmn: or after death you fall down from the sky like in a frickin battle royale game
[6:09:08] Rill_: @Enkaelol u can use leatrix
[6:09:09] moogy_moog: random rez spawn points could be interesting, but would prob need a slightly smaller zone to be fun?
[6:09:13] Filuuren: 255 confiremd not cap
[6:09:14] E3_142metheus: oh shit
[6:09:17] Linnixi: @Enkaelol try /console ffxdeath 1 or 0
[6:09:21] Yamamoto78: @PapaPoggo more like the oldschool 2v2v2v2 halo matches
[6:09:32] Enkaelol: @Linnixi thank you bro
[6:09:34] DontDv8: a lot of elements to try to create/make work with classic
[6:09:35] Chordgaille: @enkaelol /console set ffxDeath "0"
[6:09:36] kamutef: someone suggested a bg that is battle royal like, where every bg u start with bad gear e.g. and then you would get better gear and fight in a free for all environment. thoughts?
[6:09:43] Chordgaille: @enkaelol but leatrix plus is better
[6:09:43] Skeetin_: doesnt seem fun playing the game to get max lvl and dungeon clear in 12 hours more like a job
[6:09:46] bmillybmilly: cap 250 but doesnt short whatever the kill is that brings you over?
[6:09:46] Chrosis: I crit someone earlier for 1,406 with Astral Surge and I'm level 32
[6:09:48] Camosurfer21: whats the penalty for large raid groups?
[6:09:49] Treemanm: you have to touch the alter to turn in your blood
[6:09:52] HB12: what are you drinking?
[6:09:58] berserage95: i reckon this game would be really cool if they had a reference game to look at, like a  game thats been running for 20+ years
[6:10:03] HunterericTV: NA is bugged lol u dont lose stacks on death, u do on EU
[6:10:09] NosfeRAtu0202: You can res at any of the spirits that are along the road, without timer
[6:10:10] hasbucks: wut u drinking
[6:10:12] Wreckitralph_11: how do you get the blood again\
[6:10:13] HuntingOblivion: HuntingOblivion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! we digging phase 2 or what?
[6:10:13] Doolie27: Doolie27 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Much love xarxar
[6:10:14] arfus: man u living the good life huh
[6:10:17] MongoSecurity: Protein shake actually sounds good  though
[6:10:18] Yeddamand: Keep rez sickness but bodyheal at 80% mana and HP. But give oportunity for spirithealer to teleport you out of STV could also work
[6:10:20] realandtruephobe: There's another thing too, IF you respawn at GY over and over again, it doesn't let you respawn for a bit
[6:10:23] donnynorthcutt: what kind of protein do you use?
[6:10:24] ItsXoomies: can your ghost turn in blood?
[6:10:27] gdawg267: has gnomer been cleared yet?
[6:10:29] winsong: do you hav to turn in the blood durning the event or can you do it after?
[6:10:30] Modain: Pog
[6:10:33] Chiphazzord: so your saying its a non issue
[6:10:35] enigmasvea: thats the solution KEKW
[6:10:35] biiggy: fixed
[6:10:36] kenzellbtw: too chaotic
[6:10:36] biiggy: lol
[6:10:38] yellowgaiden: so they torchuring themselves
[6:10:39] RideWithJman: give increased run speed while dead?
[6:10:39] Modain: Fixed
[6:10:43] berserage95: that works
[6:10:43] LightYearsAhead: random spirit resses gives 100%
[6:10:44] berserage95: LUL
[6:10:45] NutterCircus: So they already thought of it. EleGiggle
[6:10:46] Hyelander_: The solution was there all along
[6:10:47] tellmeagainiforgot: oh look its fixed
[6:10:49] Yamamoto78: so the problem is that it sends you to the default one instead of letting you choose @Xaryu
[6:10:51] SenorPUMPS: !SLEEPINGBAG
[6:10:53] WaffletheMan101: they are just doing it for blood
[6:11:03] berserage95: thats quite well done, now people need to figure they are out there LUL

[7:10:03] drummond777: deep freeze does seem like a lvl 60 spell thou
[7:10:04] jfive87: warriors need taste for blood
[7:10:05] Austyz: end himmm. new pvp ranks
[7:10:14] guesswhofoo: I’ve seen you advocate for deep freeze since before 2020. glad you finally got it coming
[7:10:16] iiEnvy: imagine deep freeze and orb in P4/5 @Xaryu
[7:10:16] kevinrmp: 50% higher bonus crit dmg
[7:10:17] UnsafeCell: mages in PVP: wait until I have deep freeze
[7:10:18] Kash_6: 50% more crit dmg

[7:11:02] sudd7: i think so, it's the bottom rune on the site, and it's listed all belt runes and then boot runes. so it should be boots
[7:11:03] neruk887: thats why i kill every gnome i see

[7:12:17] tellmeagainiforgot: i agree it feels so wrong and unethical
[7:12:24] tjzlock: the boot heal is like 500-700 at your level if you get it, its in 1k needles

[7:14:57] Zanketsuk3n: missing a ton of rank ups
[7:14:59] The_RightTwix: Mages are the only class than cna clear an entire dungeon solo in 1 pull

[7:16:09] earltotoro: hey chat has xar tried stv event yhet?
[7:16:09] hashtagstronger: @thaplayboy69 its boring af but it hurts with feet rune and even more with waist rune. Carve is pointless. boring but it sure does dmg
[7:16:14] xSLURx: i hate it when i feel like im just a bullying someone, like they just dont fight back
[7:16:20] xSLURx: like common bro FeelsBadMan
[7:16:27] jappa132: What hunter back pedals and doesn't hit once so.many bots...

[7:16:47] Steveleeb: You think icy veins over living flame even while lvling?
[7:16:48] floddd: where should i quest lvl 29 alli
[7:16:55] RudyRube: @ramnsyn im leveling rogue first but i am so excited to get my sham to the mid30s so i can swap to ele
[7:16:56] xinnon: Couldn't see all talents
[7:17:07] seancyx: Consensual xarCoC
[7:17:08] FIREMAGZZ: G I G I G I D I D  Y
[7:17:12] hashtagstronger: @thaplayboy69 unless its massive aoe pulls and even then explosive seems to do more dmg. BM rune is prob more dmg than carve
[7:17:13] lilhester: farming noobs at 2v1 is consensual
[7:17:17] SurrealAndre: damage is great in pve, just nerfed for healing
[7:17:21] kiwidude3: @xaryu does this feel like an entirely new experience or is it more on the nostalgia side?
[7:17:33] Incin_gaming: as long as its consensual for me
[7:17:33] Tonyromoisreal: did anyone find spellpower rune yet?

[7:18:21] RudyRube: @Xaryu dont u think its funny that any friend of payo's does a payo impression without even realizing it sometimes
[7:18:23] SurrealAndre: arcane until they address the fire hit cap
[7:18:33] circusbrad: got any of the new runes yet?
