[1:25:08] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Judging by Ion's eye movements, I was able to predict the release date.
[1:25:13] amricatt: towCopium towCopium
[1:25:14] Kakotan2143: I doubt that we will see the game in Nov
[1:25:34] Rudric_Ice: he kinda leaked it
[1:25:35] Thoreya: he literally says "holidays are coming around" when talking about all raids launching at the same time
[1:25:37] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee what did your character do in the 3-year downtime? :D
[1:25:39] Rudric_Ice: let be real
[1:25:55] Zettabyte: Apex Legends, @Towelliee Kappa
[1:26:06] Alaquane: needs a new skybox
[1:26:15] NieIas: the whole releasing mythic together with normal/hc is so the raid can open 2 weeks before christmas and RWF over before christmas
[1:26:19] skymercii: how do you know its the raid enternce ?
[1:26:21] amricatt: More spewing fire
[1:26:29] Galadeon: Ion said beta, then quickly said alpha.  Soooo, beta confirmed for next week.  😋
[1:26:32] skymercii: oh LUL
[1:26:39] makazz98: LUL
[1:26:42] dracullus: with last Ion comment this Nov 28 leak looks more credible
[1:26:44] ashwing_: bruh

[1:27:33] Rudric_Ice: cool ill be able to get keys from mr tow

[1:29:06] feels____: it is
[1:29:08] Rygothx: Historically, how many weeks an expac gets released after start of beta?
[1:29:12] SlithTheSivak: there is absolutely a glyph at the top of that mountain
[1:29:16] Balkep: LUL
[1:29:16] Kakotan2143: lol

[1:29:25] dracullus: for people who just want check talents PTR is probably within month anyway
[1:30:28] Barzgrim: you should know this, if you have alpha, you get beta for sure?
[1:30:37] dwolf010: @Towelliee did you see Amazon is planning to buy EA?
[1:30:45] skymercii: its like we havent backlash in a few so how about we do this: gives TD to Veng
[1:30:47] BoezIRL: how would td make sense on a dh? it's a void power not demon
[1:30:51] scumlucki: dealing with rogues in pvp is infuriating
[1:30:54] Balkep: I think they should introduce dragon collision for dragon riding, so that players can crash into each other in midair Kappa
[1:30:55] SlithTheSivak: Theres also a trick with click to move to get regular flying in dragonflight zones
[1:30:59] captiv8: I would say TD fits the fantasy of demon hunters more than any other tank, except maybe Evoker tank towCopium
[1:31:01] LunaKura: @Towelliee If not you climbing this, I would have on launch xD
[1:31:02] Neziko: New World is finally getting group finder

[1:31:36] Rudric_Ice: give shadow priests twilight Dev

[1:32:04] MoobJuices: I just want blizzard to acknowledge druid still exists.
[1:32:17] Megadisaster24: They did @Alottamoobs

[1:37:27] mintcookie_vajankle: lol warrior brain
[1:37:35] WolfofWarSong: Still a little upset that evokers dont have a tank spec with the black dragon flight
[1:37:51] scumlucki: @WolfofWarSong in the future maybe
[1:38:09] WolfofWarSong: I hope so we need a mail tank
[1:38:36] love_eggplant: twitch has once again patched ad blockers loveegSad

[1:45:05] akia03: amazon prime is that a usa thing?
[1:45:28] Finansdepartementet: amazon aint that big here in sweden
[1:45:34] FrostedSentry: I forget all the time. I don't like checking whether it's available to use all the time. They should change the button style when it's available to use.
[1:45:37] Armdel: @akia03 nah its not NA exclusive, but not all countries have it
[1:45:39] Rudric_Ice: @akia03 its a US and EU thing
[1:45:52] hickey7979: do you guys get same income from an amazon sub
[1:45:55] Zeuzo: what hapends with the fly thing of the new race if u smash with super speed into earth

[1:46:19] hickey7979: that is nice
[1:46:19] warrenny: This reminds me of frostfire ridge
[1:46:42] JoshStrobl: @Rudric_Ice Not "an EU thing". While Prime Video is available in many places in EU, Prime (like shipping) is not. There are very few distribution centers in Europe for Amazon.
[1:46:50] ShadyBotanist66: You buy like 2x things and its worth it
[1:46:54] calcutr0n: i usually pick a different streamer each month to give it to
[1:46:55] TheCliffyShow: I just my mom's Amazon account, so I don't pay shit.
[1:46:55] Neowanderer: yeah between shipping and video rental costs
[1:46:57] Alienfromger: prime video is realy bad
[1:47:01] akia03: ah thats why amazon sucks here costs so much more to get stuff from there
[1:47:02] Lorilath: Prime shipping is available in UK though
[1:47:07] ixiya_ink: Twitch prime gaming rewards are big too just abunch if free shit
[1:47:10] JoshStrobl: So for most, the Prime Video just isn't worth it.
[1:47:13] captiv8: Is there a meta achievement for getting all of these coins?
[1:47:17] quakegoogl: lol
[1:47:21] quakegoogl: draRage PopCorn
[1:47:38] Brodih_: you cant feel bad robbing Amazon tbh
[1:47:41] remixonfire91: did they change dragon riding this week ? looks better on turns
[1:47:48] Rudric_Ice: @JoshStrobl i see
[1:47:55] Neowanderer: 130
[1:48:04] Neowanderer: i just renewed
[1:48:05] WolfofWarSong: 97.99 cad
[1:48:10] Funderik: toweliee in terms of renown rep grinding, what things can you do? preach seems to think it's locked only begind wq's and he's not happy with it.
[1:48:14] Brodih_: its 99 here in Canada
[1:48:15] amricatt: I think it's completely worth it.
[1:48:22] Beet4: We have prime shipping in Sweden as well..
[1:48:34] sillywilly209: hi @Towelliee when do you think DF is going world wide??
[1:48:41] Kdog8t7: Christmas time of year alone typically makes it worth it
[1:48:47] Neowanderer: and you get it in a day or two
[1:48:51] Beet4: prime in sweden costs SEK 59, about 5,6 usd
[1:48:57] Shuttlelol: they have some decent tv shows now too

[1:49:29] skymercii: im excited to see what shirts yall gonna come up with this xpac
[1:49:33] WolfofWarSong: id pay a little more to have access to amazon.ca and amazon.com prime spending half my time in each country atm
[1:49:33] ShadyBotanist66: Gosh I wish I had beta, waiting on Fresh Wotlk has been such a long week lol
[1:49:35] amricatt: Prime has some pretty good books too.
[1:49:42] remixonfire91: @Barzgrim i pay 3,99 a month in portugal and comes with video and shipping

[1:49:59] Shuttlelol: prime photos is really good for family sharing too
[1:50:17] Kinghorn: MR WORLDWIDE
[1:50:30] Amarlian: Look up some Brandon Sanderson. He has some great books to listen to @Towelliee
[1:50:30] Funderik: the sylvanas book was a good listen
[1:50:34] Rudric_Ice: dont u need to have prime gaming to actually get that ''free sub'' in your region ?
[1:50:45] sillywilly209: so no coment lmao
[1:50:51] ShadyBotanist66: I dont think my tokens carried over each month tho, think you gotta keep up with redemptions
[1:51:05] captiv8: Is there a meta achievement for collecting all the coins?
[1:51:15] Balkep: there's a rumor Amazon is going to buy EA
[1:51:26] Barzgrim: @remixonfire91 could be, i just took some free 2 week trial and forgot to cancel it so i got charged that 6 euros :D might be cheaper if i took yearly charge or something
[1:51:31] Brick_Bosworth: @ShadyBotanist66 it maxes out and 1 drops off each month
[1:51:34] Beet4: It's kinda insane what you get for the money
[1:51:36] findobin: Prime gaming and prime video are different in finland, have to buy both if you want 1
[1:51:40] sillywilly209: all the free loot
[1:51:41] hickey7979: did not know all this ab twitch towellie out here droppin knowledge
[1:51:44] WolfofWarSong: as far as subs go prime is crazy good
[1:51:46] findobin: I mean you need to buy both, cant get both with 1 buy
[1:52:00] ShadyBotanist66: Garfield racing is a Mario Kart game for free rn
[1:52:05] mashiesmashie: TPH is awesome
[1:52:12] spookychefkarolina: Towel I bought the adv mystery Focus flavor half scared half excited towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium

[1:52:46] Beet4: Starcraft remastered is free now
[1:52:49] WolfofWarSong: yee thats tree
[1:52:58] liden86: Amazon has its faults, but Amazon Prime is one of the best subscriptions out there, you get so much value.
[1:53:02] hickey7979: has there been any update on the new diablo
[1:53:10] scumlucki: Do you guys use rallying cry in pvp?
[1:53:18] Lupusdeus: AC Origins and Shadows of Mordor in September free
[1:53:20] Molvonos: Most of em are indie games, but sometimes you get surprised.
[1:53:23] Kinghorn: GARF KART
[1:53:25] NieIas: hope WoW does beta key drops for twitch
[1:53:26] Kinghorn: 10/10
[1:53:31] skymercii: i mean its free health @Unlucki_1s
[1:53:31] Rudric_Ice: thing is we have have amazon prime we don't have prime gaming so we can't get that free twitch sub
[1:53:35] JoshStrobl: @findobin "Prime Gaming is included with Amazon Prime and Prime Video memberships in over 200 other countries and territories." - Finland is a country supported by PrimeVideo. It is however not included with Amazon Prime itself. So you can get gaming and video under one.
[1:53:46] liden86: @Rudric_Ice they are the same thing
[1:53:46] skymercii: @Rudric_Ice yes u can
[1:54:01] Alaquane: might be a country thing?

[1:54:59] Amarlian: https://gaming.amazon.com/links/twitch/manage
[1:55:00] Megadisaster24: it sucks
[1:55:11] Amarlian: ah that does suck

[2:31:50] failure2: talk about copium
[2:31:50] SLoPPYALieN: LUL that would be funny if that ws one
[2:32:05] skymercii: @dracullus i mean between the 2 i think wildstar will always be better
[2:32:07] zerkx1: I can't wait for Anthem 2 pepeD
[2:32:07] mavericks312: @Molvonos i mean even there sports games some years are garbage
[2:32:07] JoshStrobl: @dracullus Now this is the alternate reality I want to live in.
[2:32:09] xhaven: bug?
[2:32:11] FeralLikeMe: more of a chance to fix feral than fix anthem lol
[2:32:14] fewyn: maybe it's bugged?
[2:32:22] spookychefkarolina: @molvonos LUL LUL
[2:32:27] skymercii: @FeralLikeMe feral ?
[2:32:36] hickey7979: 6
[2:32:49] Molvonos: @mavericks312 You mean like every single game that's just been retitled for the new year, for the last 20 years?  Oh, def.  But they have their prefs.
[2:32:55] mavericks312: i will say it looks like amazon wants some of that console money that EA is getting
[2:33:08] hickey7979: nutty
[2:33:21] mavericks312: @Molvonos remember when nba live was actually good

[2:36:41] SensationalBanana: BIG TWIST: Dragonflight was WOTLK all along!!
[2:36:49] Alienfromger: DF ready for release? Kappa
[2:36:51] WingsDub: They wanted to put the quality expac there
[2:38:04] raldrik: grimrail greatest hits towStop towIt
[2:38:13] Daarksyde: Do you think they will have Fated raids during pre-patch?
[2:38:25] KaisenSiru: The first week of each Fated mythic raid was a good challenge
[2:38:29] Dankind64: why he sound nervous 🤔
[2:38:35] smashwow: grimrail depot does hit though Kappa
[2:38:43] doomkry: i really like what they did with fated raids and season 4 overall
[2:38:45] smashwow: in dat ass
[2:39:18] smashwow: i don't like the rotation of the raids. still don't understand that.
[2:39:28] NestLucky: yes short season
[2:39:46] smashwow: just open up all the raids and let the group decide where they want to spend their time
[2:39:52] mintcookie_vajankle: Rotation is good. I'd kms if I had to do 3 raids a week. I'm a pugger.
[2:40:14] mavericks312: the dinar system is actually a great pity system tbh
[2:40:25] smashwow: not saying you do 3 raids. lock it to one raid that you pick
[2:40:40] Strouss: other then my 298 weapon token that never worked  ><
[2:40:40] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:41:01] smashwow: if you want to be in sotfo week one cool. if you want CN for the next 2 weeks do that
[2:41:07] Zivs: could yea
[2:41:25] smashwow: yeah dinar should be a continued feature
[2:41:36] instant_savage: it drops a currency but u cant buy gear from bosses u havent killed
[2:41:40] hickey7979: would be dope tho
[2:41:40] instant_savage: that would work
[2:41:40] RiskyBusines_ez: Activating it together with cross-realm mythic, and only buy items from bosses you have killed before?
[2:41:46] smashwow: i'd say turn it on wk4 done
[2:41:46] kyr_slowbro: End of season is really late
[2:41:54] dwolf010: you could make the treshold way bigger. instead of 30 bosses killed 90 bosses killed
[2:42:03] doomkry: weak4 is too soon
[2:42:05] doomkry: week*
[2:42:24] tsktsk: But what’s the point of it at the end? At that point it’s just for xmog. I think the issue is you go 5 months without ever getting the item even though you cleared the content non stop every week
[2:42:57] Fleymour: KEKWDISCO wait for answer @Towelliee
[2:43:05] hickey7979: hahahahaha
[2:43:08] Strouss: lol
[2:43:16] t0pgun_: KEKW
[2:43:18] doomkry: one of the options that would work better is maybe you could select a preference for item slots in the vault
[2:43:19] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: omg KEKW
[2:43:23] ClutchKladdkaka: lololol
[2:43:23] Armdel: mythic splits 💀

[2:43:47] Thoreya: 3 streamers reacting to this, who do i watch NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[2:43:59] Lor0ark: Clap
[2:44:00] mavericks312: max out here trying to backstab this question
[2:44:00] Zivs: It's not even a disguise tho, it's for pugging mythic bosses, which is still a top % player issue
[2:44:01] Nightshaft25: KEKW
[2:44:06] Strouss: but Ion is a hunter and saw threw the stealth
[2:44:13] spookychefkarolina: Clever girl
[2:44:18] KaisenSiru: "Mythic not meant for pugs." - Ion GIGACHAD
[2:44:20] Funderik: it's defo not a pug concern
[2:44:22] dimofodi: @Towelliee he actually during his react said he never should have said PUG because he meant lower end CE/mythic guilds that don't get CE having trouble especially later in the expansion with roster etc.
[2:44:25] Vonsterr: Nathrazim Infiltrator
[2:44:32] Thoreya: @dimofodi yea
[2:44:45] spainard15: Yes Ion is correct
[2:44:52] mavericks312: max is mal ganis confirmed lol

[2:45:21] Daarksyde: Max's face is disappointment
[2:45:24] ClutchKladdkaka: yeah
[2:45:30] mavericks312: yea i actually agree with ion here
[2:45:38] spainard15: Ion said Get GOOD MAX
[2:45:41] hickey7979: ion is right
[2:45:44] Aquadriel: yeah he did
[2:45:50] KaisenSiru: 100% ion
[2:45:52] PokerFaceMoose: "unintended"
[2:45:54] TwoCenk: instead of removing lockouts, they can make more small raids like wrath of LK's for pugs
[2:45:54] hickey7979: his face when max said it killed me
[2:46:15] rockhell12: would make buying the CE mount cheaper probably
[2:47:34] XiMoee: all his questions concerned that one percent players
[2:47:51] Dirkadur: thats a lot of money gone though for xfers
[2:48:30] c0mmander_starscream: Yay, Ion is out of his basement! towOny
[2:48:35] hickey7979: wish they would make race change payable w/ gold
[2:48:40] doomkry: yeah realm transfers bricking lockouts is also a issue my guild had with some members
[2:48:41] Strouss: i hope so!
[2:49:15] Xetherot: just merge guilds with the community system?
[2:49:16] thymos_: @hickey7979 ahahahaha yeah they will never offer that for gold
[2:49:17] raldrik: thread not spaghetti huge difference LUL
[2:49:29] Zivs: sounds great

[2:50:03] dwolf010: cross faction and cross realm
[2:50:04] dwolf010: giga
[2:50:07] CritcobainTV: when that happens are you gonna play alliance again? @Towelliee
[2:50:08] Funderik: the tech guys just need to figure out how to unlock the old code that was put in place that didn't allow just a feature
[2:50:12] goosejamss: lol at fans thinking "oh this should be an easy fix for engineering"
[2:50:13] RodanQQ: I want toxic
[2:50:15] Strouss: you got it @headshot_hunter6
[2:50:22] thymos_: make a 3rd faction pogu
[2:50:25] goosejamss: @Funderik not how it works at all lmao
[2:50:27] Thoreya: towelliees hate for pvp grows more and more LUL
[2:50:39] doomkry: tbh i dont know why they even added the limit to faction option in premade group finder
[2:50:40] cruzeal: pvp ResidentSleeper
[2:50:42] RuFFyLyx: "no one pvps anymore", let me introduce you to..EU
[2:50:43] Funderik: @fractaleyes that's exactly how it works and it's what ion just said.
[2:50:45] LCS01: here it comes
[2:50:51] Zivs: his mic pops pretty frequently yea
[2:50:53] goosejamss: 2
[2:50:54] doomkry: from all the groups i have seen they never selected that option
[2:50:59] TMMOOF: did they say cross faction guilds??
[2:51:14] SLoPPYALieN: @Funderik Jurassic Park Engineer guy: "Aaah aaaah aah you didn't say the magic word!"
[2:51:14] smashwow: also at levels that mimic high level
[2:51:26] LCS01: @TMMOOF he said they want to bring it before the next expansion
[2:51:32] mintcookie_vajankle: no lol
[2:51:32] goosejamss: @Funderik lol you don't "unlock old code". there's just dependencies in the code
[2:51:33] captivate7: nope
[2:51:35] dwolf010: not us
[2:51:38] Lupusdeus: nope
[2:51:38] Retpally9329: naw
[2:51:39] StrifeTheWalker: Some RLs yes
[2:51:40] mavericks312: no
[2:51:40] headshot_hunter6: oh ive been in a few
[2:51:42] Dinermoe: no
[2:51:42] pancho_man50: Not my guild
[2:51:45] Strouss: people try to..... but its not needed
[2:51:45] CritcobainTV: Yes, I am an entire AOTC guild EZ
[2:51:45] cruzeal: monk buff maybe
[2:51:46] mintcookie_vajankle: its ideal, but no
[2:51:46] Draz3nx: nopr
[2:51:47] WolfofWarSong: walock and dk for some bosses
[2:51:47] victoryhowl: No
[2:51:48] zirethAK: zirethAK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! no
[2:51:49] Kooznik: Dont HAVE to, would like to
[2:51:50] ArcaneMaki: no
[2:51:50] Valestrus: DK sometimes
[2:51:51] dwolf010: I know some do, but most not
[2:51:52] Greybeard_ttv: nah
[2:51:53] Wcvechten: no, we're just happy  if we  do, but not required
[2:51:53] captivate7: our philosophy is play what you want, we will figure it out
[2:51:54] nelorixx: HC? nah
[2:51:55] Mehlwyrm: u dont have to, but its a major disadvantage
[2:51:57] theoriginalzinng: half of our team is a carry pretty much
[2:51:58] Ordicos: we do the we would like to
[2:51:58] doomkry: dk most def
[2:51:58] Lupusdeus: our aotc guild comp is janky as fuck, we still do it
[2:51:59] JustVek: ive been in on in bfa and they werent crazy about minmaxxing buffs, they took what they could
[2:52:00] Xetherot: guilds out here with all melee dps lol
[2:52:02] nitemare34godd: No our guild don’t really
[2:52:04] CanadianCataclysm: We are an AOTC guild who balances 2-4 groups and we clear heroic and get AOTC in 8-10 weeks
[2:52:06] Greybeard_ttv: we have people that play those anyway
[2:52:08] warrenny: Hell no
[2:52:15] Dinermoe: we just try to balance ranged and melee LUL
[2:52:15] c0mmander_starscream: Fuck no
[2:52:17] Freemzz: no
[2:52:18] zenkodac: no, but it for sure hurts the smoothness of our reclears
[2:52:20] spainard15: No
[2:52:25] mavericks312: if you can play your class you raid basically it
[2:52:26] twilightsparklepwny: nah
[2:52:28] StrifeTheWalker: Yes
[2:52:32] ArcaneMaki: That's my guild right now, and no we never do that.
[2:52:32] Wcvechten: Yeah, our goal is to clear AOTC with whatever people WANT to play
[2:52:38] skymercii: no
[2:52:40] thymos_: me :)
[2:52:40] vonblue: my old guild did yes
[2:52:41] iseka11: it happens more in m+ than raids
[2:52:42] c0mmander_starscream: NOP
[2:52:45] Fleymour: those guilds i see on reddit. like 2-3 weeks before patch . hey we got curve and screnshot from kill LUL
[2:52:45] StrifeTheWalker: A few, yes
[2:52:46] Freemzz: it’s like whatever, we go with whatever we have
[2:52:48] Aquadriel: @Towelliee usually last bosses start getting a bit tricky for AOTC guilds, like DK starts to be required and raid buffs start making a little impact, not a lot but do.
[2:52:50] Alaquane: it's more like a loud vocal whining that people wished that someone played X
[2:52:51] cptrogers123: AOTC is piss easy KEKW
[2:52:51] twilightsparklepwny: and finally blizzard should get away these world first mentality ints less than 1%
[2:52:51] Greybeard_ttv: I would be just change guilds lol
[2:52:54] LeGoogs: My guild doesnt force anyone to switch but they def recruit to have all the raid buffs @Towelliee
[2:52:54] Subjektive: there are try hard AOTC guilds lol
[2:52:59] dwolf010: grip way more powerfull then the buffs for AoTC
[2:53:00] dillapuss: Depending on the fight and guild yeah it happens
[2:53:01] Mecabeast: those people are hard to recruit my guild still needs enh shaman and mage
[2:53:11] Eggspoached: Previous expansions my Guild had to have certain classes just because we did not have the numbers for raid.
[2:53:11] doomkry: the thing is pretty much of the "required" buff/classes,you can find players that already play some of those classes
[2:53:11] Funderik: @fractaleyes i didn't mean literally UNLOCK something. the game was hard coded a certain way for so many years, they ned to figure it out so they can recode it for this feature.
[2:53:12] CritcobainTV: Basically you just bring whatever people are best at. imo
[2:53:18] skymercii: my guild is aotc only  my guild said: as long you are comfortable on your class and enjoy it thats good enough for him
[2:53:34] Tharia: lol
[2:53:37] ArcaneMaki: lol
[2:53:39] Dinermoe: HUH
[2:53:42] cruzeal: PepeLaugh
[2:53:43] Funderik: @Funderik no sure what you mean by that.
[2:53:45] Dinermoe: that hurt Ion Sadge
[2:54:04] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:54:38] doomkry: boomkin stacking in sl S1 KEKW
[2:54:43] spainard15: keep making classes those 20 slots will be filled with one every class until we are at 40 mans again
[2:54:50] goosejamss: @Funderik right, but it's not as easy as you make it sound. they don't want to break the entire game for days at a time just to implement cross faction guilds
[2:55:16] Dinermoe: HE SAID BETA
[2:55:19] PanoramicPanda: makes me miss the 10m class runs
[2:55:19] Tharia: bringing back hunter rez?
[2:55:20] Daarksyde: wuuuut
[2:55:20] ArcaneMaki: oh shit Ion slipped!
[2:55:21] KaisenSiru: Paladin Brez Pog
[2:55:22] Tharia: aww
[2:55:22] Dinermoe: everyone towCopium
[2:55:25] Strouss: give it back to hunter
[2:55:26] mavericks312: oh fuck evokers everywhere confirmed lol

[2:55:30] mintcookie_vajankle: Give it to Shamans lol
[2:55:32] Dinermoe: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[2:55:40] beeannpa: sounds like paladins
[2:55:42] iseka11: how will a brez on a ret will help the fact that is completely useless?
[2:55:43] abracka_: next thing we know rogues get the brez
[2:55:45] DigitalChill: lol
[2:55:45] Daarksyde: Pala brez makes sense
[2:55:46] Aggravius: paladin brez huge
[2:55:51] Draz3nx: paladins more utility yay
[2:55:56] Sarocus: Does he not know us at all?
[2:55:57] Scoodles91: they are making a reason to bring ret :D
[2:55:57] Intikamcy: pls
[2:55:58] Dinermoe: give warrior innervate Kappa
[2:56:05] Sarocus: We will quote the shit out of everything
[2:56:05] Funderik: @fractaleyes i never implied it was easy, nor do i think that, i was explaining the basic progress of what they have to do.
[2:56:07] skymercii: make SV a tank pet class pls kthnx
[2:56:08] Zivs: that can definetly make me bring a ret to m+
[2:56:09] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: Did he say Pally battle Rez FUCKKKKK YA\
[2:56:12] headshot_hunter6: yeah pally brez would be sick
[2:56:16] doomkry: ppl acting like ret is useless
[2:56:31] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: mouse over hot key lol\
[2:56:37] mintcookie_vajankle: Most paladins I see canm't even use BoP or Sac, adding Brez HMMMM
[2:56:49] Molvonos: @doomkry Arent they?  Arent they???  towSip
[2:56:51] KaisenSiru: @doomkry They don't know their potentency PepeLaugh
[2:56:54] Intikamcy: but its paladin, so the cooldown its one expansion
[2:56:56] JustVek: true
[2:57:00] Phil87z: Evoker eating Magee lunch
[2:57:24] Alaquane: if you don't have devo aura from someone else, ret not entirely useless
[2:57:41] skymercii: @doomkry ive seen maybe 5 ret pallies in keys (15s-20s) since the start of the season
[2:57:57] Tharia: lol
[2:58:03] Aquadriel: OMEGALUL
[2:58:06] Intikamcy: balance? how do u balance the pvp? that's the question
[2:58:12] mavericks312: max stays getting shit nerfed lol
[2:58:20] Fleymour: give WL utility to other classes rcdMadge
[2:58:20] TheRiwen: survival need a big nerf
[2:58:20] XiMoee: remove death grip
[2:58:25] Aggravius: oh no grip nerfed
[2:58:29] XiMoee: BabyRage
[2:58:30] Molvonos: Death Grip has now been changed to be similar to it's Torghast counterpart, pulling  the Death Knight to their intended target.
[2:58:31] mavericks312: @Intikamcy imagine thinking pvp is on blizzards main goals atm
[2:58:45] skymercii: @iMoee_ if grip is removed just remove bubble too KEKW
[2:59:00] nelorixx: @Molvonos so a charge? 🤔
[2:59:02] iseka11: there should not be a class, like warlocks. that can only be the ones doing 1 thing, need to overlap like on wrath where 2 classes provided the same buff
[2:59:02] JustVek: @TheRiwen survival has never been viable since the rework in legion, its thier rime in the light. i dont play one but i know the feeling playing a non meta class
[2:59:26] Molvonos: @Molvonos Yes
[2:59:39] mintcookie_vajankle: Nooooooo
[2:59:47] nightwolf_87: Agree
[2:59:48] Molvonos: Evoker's getting Dragongrip

[3:10:49] Nightshaft25: iron docks was cool
[3:10:57] nelorixx: but the tunning might be monkaS
[3:11:20] dwolf010: that does not really matter tho for S1 and S2. becouse all dungeons are new in those dungeons
[3:11:21] Rudric_Ice: i kinda hate COS lol
[3:11:22] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: +
[3:11:29] MercurialPTDR: so basically Blizz needs to do their job with tuning
[3:11:30] Xerevil: @saltyohm Occulus wasn't bad,it was bad because people didn't know which drakes to use.
[3:11:49] Jollywhompus: Why not just make old dungeons = Shadowlands | BFA where Mythic tuning is already more established
[3:11:51] raldrik: They need to allow you to run it on heroic scaling to learn them
[3:11:56] elderikp: Finding enough people with the right professions to do court of stars
[3:11:56] Wcvechten: CoS has the luck of being in the TW M+ pool atleast
[3:12:08] Rudric_Ice: gimme skyreach that dungo is fun
[3:12:13] jmalmin: I am unable to do iron Docks and Grimrail.. I get a streaming error every time I load into warlords content. :(
[3:12:23] MercurialPTDR: that guy is gross
[3:12:27] Molvonos: CoS is gonna be a dead key due to the hide & go fuck yourself at the end of the dungeon.
[3:12:30] kaybrink: lol ove jdotb
[3:12:41] xhaven: @jmalmin did you try repairing wow?

[3:13:31] Rudric_Ice: raids suck anwyays lol zero loot
[3:13:46] Molvonos: Cant upgrade raid loot as easily as M+ loot
[3:14:20] jmalmin: Repaired the game a few times I even did a reinstall. WoD just dosnt work anymore, the other expansions works like normal.
[3:14:22] Rudric_Ice: why do u even wanna run raids when m+ does everything lol
[3:14:31] Molvonos: Yep
[3:14:33] Zivs: end boss ilvl
[3:14:37] CritcobainTV: mythic quality yes, but the last bosses have higher ilvl
[3:14:37] Fenwig: @Towelliee 311 loot
[3:14:38] Wcvechten: not on the endgame boss ilvl
[3:14:38] Mehlwyrm: Endboss he said endboss

[3:14:41] icerasta: end boss ilvl
[3:14:42] Aquadriel: end boss ilvl is what they want
[3:14:44] kyr_slowbro: He said mythic end boss
[3:14:45] Rob3phones: End boss Ilevel loot
[3:14:45] futomara01: mythic raid loot is higher ilvl
[3:14:48] elderikp: yes they have Mythic level loot. While the rest of your team is partly geared in HC gear
[3:14:49] ShowDUH: No he mean the +7 ilvl gear from last bosses
[3:14:54] MOXP: @Towelliee they could make m+ loot like PVP loot: make it higher ILVL for m+
[3:14:56] zgag: They could add bonus rolls
[3:15:04] ChuckyG0: not neccesery, often raid trinkets are way beyond bis in comparison to m+ trinkets
[3:15:05] BfAleTitan: make it a +20 vault reward
[3:15:05] CritcobainTV: @zgag stop oit
[3:15:07] CritcobainTV: it
[3:15:09] FeralLikeMe: just cap the itlvl for high lvl keys at the same level of raiding and if u do super high keys make the itlvl increase higher when you're in M+
[3:15:13] zgag: Not vault
[3:15:16] zgag: For raids

[3:15:32] Attackroot: I keep getting gloves…. Lol
[3:15:33] Rudric_Ice: just add titanforge for m+ EZ
[3:15:34] Funderik: bonus rolls were just extra rng and 99% of the time it was 75 gold, idk people loved them so much.
[3:15:34] Megadisaster24: I mean, they can just make Valor vendor that sells Good Gear from M+
[3:15:34] Draz3nx: bring back raid looting from bfa
[3:15:36] LCS01: me being a pug player i dont see reason to raid
[3:15:37] Scoodles91: still want bonus rolls :D
[3:15:38] roxlul: you already have 3 choices in vault if you grind it, thats like havin 2 rerolls
[3:15:44] BfAleTitan: oh max, thats just wrong bud
[3:15:59] CritcobainTV: @Critcobain I'll never stop oit. in my life
[3:16:42] thymos_: KEKW
[3:16:45] Mecabeast: letting people get mythic upgrade tokens without doing mythic raid would be fantastic from vault tokens

[3:17:11] Rudric_Ice: Max needed to ask about soar
[3:17:15] SensationalBanana: They need to extend it to all mounts, not just dragons!
[3:17:27] LCS01: @SensationalBanana no
[3:17:30] jhopps12: super dumb question, but I keep hearing "evergreen" in terms of wow systems. what does that mean?
[3:17:34] zgag: Something that separates raids from +, but not overboard
[3:17:36] CritcobainTV: @zgag why are you trying to bring back titanforging and bonus rolls KEKW
[3:17:41] Funderik: @Towelliee they could make more mount equipment that have perks from dragonriding
[3:17:45] elderikp: @jhopps12 Permanent system
[3:17:48] fluh_: but you made us throw our artifact weapons away ion sadge
[3:17:54] LCS01: i want to still able to just go up press num lock and get stucked in sort of mountain while i was afk @SensationalBanana

[3:20:39] Angsterz: nno soar but bloodlust!
[3:20:42] Funderik: cause soar isn't important, the change wasn't a big deal.
[3:20:59] CritcobainTV: Last Question [NYI] OMEGALUL
[3:21:01] CraftyClaw: DONT MENTION THE SOAR
[3:21:06] Rudric_Ice: @Funderik it was u are in the wrong bud
[3:21:12] elderikp: Did they fix the new race yet to make it faster?
[3:21:14] FeralLikeMe: soar not a big deal .. just a unnecessary change tbh
[3:21:19] stormstruck12: hey is there any way to prep for DF or is literally everything going to be reset??
[3:21:20] findobin: systems Madge

[3:23:13] dracullus: 32nd February release confirmed
[3:23:22] Funderik: information overload, he just watched all this split run spread sheets all at once in his head when ion said that.
[3:23:23] warbringer159: tbh i wish the interview was a bit better in multiple ways, he only asked questions regarding like 1% of the player base
[3:23:27] LCS01: me neither
[3:23:28] KaisenSiru: NOPERS
[3:23:28] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee It was like a job interview, Ion was the boss and Max the newcomer LOL
[3:23:33] c0mmander_starscream: Ion waits till the end of the stream to dump on max
[3:23:39] abracka_: @abracka_ no we did not lmfao
[3:23:41] Fleymour: Max broke next 30min of this question @towelliee
[3:23:41] BfAleTitan: honestly it would only effect the world first
[3:23:44] Nightshaft25: NOPE THANKD
[3:23:48] BfAleTitan: everyone else will just progress normally
[3:23:49] CritcobainTV: Ion interviewed max KEKW
[3:23:53] RiskyBusines_ez: straight into mythic until they hit a wall, then hc farm - just like it is now
[3:23:56] xhaven: I say do it!
[3:23:57] nightknightjiujitsu: theyre just gonna be extra sweaty
[3:24:03] MILESkg21: of course max only cares about the 1% Kappa
[3:24:10] Layliah79: No more WFR needing alts?!
[3:24:15] mavericks312: that literally only effects the 1%
[3:24:20] noosphear: It only effects the RFW guys.  It has 0 effect on anyone else.
[3:24:24] Balkep: the race is going to be sweatier
[3:24:29] Layliah79: I like the idea myself!
[3:24:36] Alienfromger: dman 1% elitists
[3:24:36] FeralLikeMe: only effects the 1%
[3:24:37] dracullus: he should ask Max if he prefers Mythic launching second week or Christmas with family
[3:24:38] abracka_: honestly who even cares at this point, just launch em all at the same time fuck it
[3:24:39] Funderik: there's no down side to making it all release at once for the mass player base.
[3:24:40] Scoodles91: 1% will raid for 24/7 the first week :D
[3:24:43] raldrik: we can get right to M+ then as well
[3:24:44] TollBoothVideos: I don't hate it, let people play how they want whenever they want to.
[3:24:49] spookychefkarolina: why not towCopium towCopium
[3:24:57] captiv8: And you still can
[3:25:00] Layliah79: Mythic Week 1 = M+ Week ! tho
[3:25:02] captiv8: Right
[3:25:03] Fleymour: so it's 1% thing equal  to 1000-1500 mythic guilds?
[3:25:10] Nightshaft25: @mileskg21 the entire interview was for the 1% of people Kappa
[3:25:15] dracullus: average player prepare for mythic raiding first week of season? xD
[3:25:18] noosphear: Maybe you go kill the first Mythic boss or two as loot pinatas.
[3:25:19] JustVek: @Fleymour less
[3:25:21] TacticalWee: Hugglethemuggle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[3:25:23] Qeevdo: yep so that the race dont go into the holidays LUL
[3:25:24] elderikp: Let 'm test it out.
[3:25:27] akia03: atleast release full lfr at that time aswel than
[3:25:28] Jawis: don't see a problem with that, speaking as a casual myself it doesn't have impact on my gameplay 🤷
[3:25:33] Funderik: try it for a patch see how it goes, what's the worst that can happen.
[3:25:44] BfAleTitan: it kills buckets
[3:25:53] Aquadriel: I think simultaneous release would have more logistic decisions for WFR people, do we clear hc? do wer progress? whats best? etc
[3:26:02] captiv8: That’s basically ion saying we want to release mythic before the holidays
[3:26:02] Fawcheddar: critroleTravis
[3:26:02] JustVek: @Fleymour only 500 guilds raiding in s4.
[3:26:03] nightknightjiujitsu: column a and b i think
[3:26:06] raldrik: try to do a few mythic bosses to get a bit of gear for the first reset
[3:26:07] Funderik: we'd see some asian rank 450th guild get WF kill on first boss.
[3:26:12] Nightshaft25: Would be worse
[3:26:15] Layliah79: I'd love it!
[3:26:20] confl1ct10n: I don’t know, I think it would possibly add more competition to the race for world first. They don’t have a full week of spamming split runs.
[3:26:25] Aquadriel: @Towelliee does this also mean full LFR release too?
[3:26:38] HebbyB: people stepping into mythic with normal quality gear might be pretty interesting lol
[3:27:03] jhopps12: as a casual AOTC raider, I feel like this doesn't impact me at all
[3:27:06] captiv8: I say why not. LFR norm heroic mythic all the same week. Merry Christmas
[3:27:10] brimtank: By the end of the week Max would look like Doc Brown from back to the future
[3:27:11] elderikp: Perhaps another Emerald Nightmare, isn't that bad
[3:27:12] Layliah79: Should of replied back asking about a Creation Catalyst release then if M was week 1
[3:27:29] jamiboiy: wasn't group loot coming back too? meaning getting tier should be easier
[3:27:32] Nicstar1007: Can't they do M+ for Tier Set?
[3:27:43] Nightshaft25: @brim_boh LUL
[3:27:46] skoxxinator: so 13. december raid release date?  And 28 Nov. Dragonflight release confirmed? :D
[3:27:49] Dinermoe: @Nicstar1007 only end of week vault rewarded tier
[3:28:12] abracka_: "so you want more splits"
[3:28:13] RiskyBusines_ez: that was a real pug issue tho...
[3:28:21] Nicstar1007: oh, ty
[3:28:25] flebbooo: LUL
[3:28:35] Rhoncer: LUL
[3:28:36] dracullus: @skoxxinator I think so, if it was earlier, no reason to launch mythic same week
[3:28:39] RiskyBusines_ez: it is XD
[3:28:44] MrGharr: you don't want to join a mythic lockout to risk not even killing any bosses and get a lock
[3:28:46] Nightshaft25: More splits huh?
[3:28:51] Nightshaft25: LUL
[3:28:52] Rhoncer: yeah he said that
[3:28:54] MOXP: actually mythic pug would be interesting
[3:29:02] Mecabeast: there was some truth some pug mythic groups struggle to get people when it's not a fresh run
[3:29:06] feels____: its world 500-1000 issue
[3:29:14] Buckwink: I dont think Max knows that players dont pug mythic lol Max is very 1 percenter
[3:29:22] ArcaneMaki: Ion former Lawyer
[3:29:48] Nightshaft25: play it again for the laughs LUL
[3:29:55] Buckwink: Madden is fucked then
[3:29:56] Adornus: @Buckwink they do on some large servers - but part of the reason they dont pug it is because of the lockouts
[3:29:58] CritcobainTV: D:
[3:30:02] CritcobainTV: we got Jebaited
[3:30:03] TheHardcorian: EA KEKW Wallmart will pick it up when its worth -$100k
[3:30:04] jure__: somebody had EA stocks and needed to sell LUL
[3:30:05] MrGharr: now react to Max reacting to himself
[3:30:10] dracullus: my sources that I just made up say otherwise
[3:30:10] Zettabyte: Retweet that link, @Towelliee please :)
[3:30:12] mavericks312: its smart on amazons part EA would be a huge pr problem to manage
[3:30:18] Alaquane: pump and dump EA stocks scheme
[3:30:18] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/AX5xMxBivo9?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[3:30:20] AlphasaurusRexx: @Buckwink madden has been fucked for a while
[3:30:22] ctg_dreamz: He said later on he was talking about Mythic guilds that might need 1-2 players later in a tier when people quit
[3:30:25] dewking93: would a microsoft . ea deal happen?
[3:30:25] jure__: @pacific3210 WeSmart
[3:30:35] flebbooo: Even then its only really 3 bosses at most
[3:30:36] Mecabeast: people don't really pug mythic because it's not a fresh lockout
[3:30:39] MOXP: what about MSFT and blizz?
[3:30:48] mavericks312: @dewking93 xbox cant sneeze wrong right now so highly doubt it

[3:30:54] Funderik: mythic pugs happen on old tiers for mount drops
[3:31:07] MrGharr: They should remove the lockout if you don't kill any boss
[3:31:17] feels____: mythic lockouts are a problem for people that extend at last boss and dont get any loot for a month
[3:31:23] RiskyBusines_ez: How is it not a pug issue? When you pug mythic, you kill a boss or 2 and someone leaves, it is IMPOSSIBLE to continue, because nobody wants to sacrifice 1-2 bosses of their lockout to join that raid
[3:31:25] dracullus: removing server/faction boundaries is better way imo
[3:31:29] RiskyBusines_ez: That is literally why you dont mythic pug
[3:31:46] Buckwink: max is still very innocent
[3:31:50] warbringer159: atleast you asked questions about more than 1 thing
[3:32:31] Nightshaft25: Sure mate
[3:32:35] Molvonos: The throwaway question
[3:32:38] jure__: he shouldnt have either, many other creators had interviews with Ion, he should've gone full on RWF mode
[3:33:00] stormstruck12: anything besides leveling to 60 to prep for DF?
[3:33:04] DigitalChill: haha
[3:33:04] Kale_Nd: https://i.imgur.com/8jIQuV8.png @Towelliee
[3:33:07] xluckydawgx: Best frame
[3:33:12] flebbooo: OMEGALUL the "aah fuck" moment
[3:33:15] nerefwow: NotLikeThis
[3:33:16] nekodaye: he looks like bolvar
[3:33:22] Vaesandryn: Look how proud Ion looks
[3:33:25] jure__: pretty sure it wasnt even from that moment LUL
[3:33:27] Qeevdo: richkidNLT
[3:33:33] Nightshaft25: ERROR ERROR
[3:33:40] Funderik: that's the look of "split spreadsheet overload"
[3:33:43] Odinslayer: he looked like bolvar on the throne LUL
[3:33:52] BigJoeChestnut: With Ion’s face it’s perfect
[3:34:03] HebbyB: I feel like Ion rarely drops a scoop so it was kind of nice to see
[3:34:09] AlphasaurusRexx: he was discussing on his stream the day before the interview that he was going to do his best to not ask questions from a RWF POV. I think his tweet is genuine.
[3:34:11] akia03: so m+ also early?
[3:34:17] szble: OMEGALUL
[3:34:20] theoriginalzinng: honestly its probably less work for them to just release it all at once too
[3:34:23] Frank4LuLz: i like lfr
[3:34:47] szble: dude is not jumping into mythic lol
[3:34:50] dracullus: he has to strategize between watching asmon failing normal or people doing race
[3:34:54] Rhoncer: no one forces you to do mythic lol
[3:34:54] Odinslayer: did you get the "holidays" line from ion? nov release still possible ? @Towelliee
[3:34:57] LCS01: if this happen i still have to strategy how early i will got home from work to play
[3:34:57] MrGharr: average wowhead commenter: "giving you more options to do it earlier" => "Why are we required to do this earlier?"
[3:35:14] Odinslayer: yea
[3:35:15] LCS01: yeah
[3:35:18] SeckSymbols: Very end
[3:35:18] Corgi_Bark: it was at the end yeah
[3:35:18] Its_an_implication: Yeah at the end with his question
[3:35:18] Rhoncer: yeah
[3:35:21] raldrik: yeah he did
[3:35:23] silversquall88: "we know about hte holidays and working around that"
[3:35:23] PokerFaceMoose: yes he said release at one time because of holidays
[3:35:24] Jollywhompus: He said about raid launch he mentioned holidays
[3:35:24] Technogre: my guild wont... I'm the only person in my guild BibleThump
[3:35:29] SpyCrabbo: they think that ion will literally chain them to their desks and force them to do mythic week one
[3:35:30] Nightshaft25: yeah
[3:35:32] jamiboiy: if anything it will make 2nd week hc runs easier for people if m+ is also unlocked first week
[3:35:37] dracullus: yeah, that's why I'm 90% sure about Nov 28 release
[3:35:39] Templexx: lmao
[3:35:39] Rhoncer: KEKW
[3:35:40] nerefwow: LFR LUL
[3:35:41] mintcookie_vajankle: Race to world first is top tier degeneracy anyway. Look at the nerfs that had to go through in Sepulcher, this doesn't make the game better.
[3:35:41] MercurialPTDR: pretty much yeah..
[3:35:44] mavericks312: this man actually brought up lfr lol
[3:35:45] Quecklain: KEKW
[3:35:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, we want LFR on day one!
[3:35:46] botscast: asking the real questions KEKW
[3:36:00] Nightshaft25: True
[3:36:01] toocheap2rhyme: towStop towIt
[3:36:06] Zivs: the lfr schedule is pretty rough tbf but ur prob right lol
[3:36:06] nerefwow: Day 1 LFR wouldn't be able to kill a boss
[3:36:11] awkswow: Yes, remove time gating from LFR, preferably by removing LFR
[3:36:16] RiskyBusines_ez: have you ever tried to lug mythic towel? xD
[3:36:28] LearnedSomething: what do you think the reasoning behind the change is
[3:36:34] SeckSymbols: @awkswow LFR existing doesn't hurt anyone
[3:36:35] RiskyBusines_ez: pug*
[3:36:42] szble: yeah its fine
[3:36:44] akia03: @awkswow if they remove mythic and suck aswel sure
[3:36:48] jmalmin: Day 1 LFR do kill bosses almost as fast as normal raids do. There are good players in LFR.
[3:36:52] nerefwow: @shytam trying to avoid a mythic release on christmas
[3:36:54] LCS01: sup
[3:37:00] dracullus: he said nothing about LFR, people will scream ION LIED when LFR will start week later as always
[3:37:02] Mecabeast: I still would like to see lfr changed to be solo player content
[3:37:02] Odinslayer: i mean if they will release raids day 1 people still need to level and farm the shit out of dungeons so they can atleast finish lfr lol
[3:37:03] LearnedSomething: that's silly
[3:37:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[3:37:25] Technogre: I think releasing everything all at once/earlier makes RWF more interesting since they have plan better and rush to actually be ready
[3:37:36] SpoofAvatar: all 4 difficulties should be released the same day without gating
[3:37:38] Theliahh: KEKW
[3:37:49] szble: wowhead comments are bottom of the barrel
[3:37:50] flebbooo: jesus bro KEKW
[3:37:53] Funderik: i don't care but he's my opinion you should care about.
[3:37:58] skymercii: thats a bit of a reach LUL
[3:37:59] Theliahh: wowhead commenters KEKW
[3:38:05] Aggravius: gamers can be extreme
[3:38:11] SmallzzIV: that kinda sums up todays day and age lol
[3:38:19] mavericks312: even though 99% wont be touching mythic the first month
[3:38:28] Funderik: there's alot of who asked comments on that post.
[3:38:31] jmalmin: I am all 4 it.. Dump all the raids at the sametime. Does not hurt anyone.
[3:38:38] SeckSymbols: It was at the very end of the question he asked Ma
[3:38:38] dracullus: well you listen to same interview
[3:38:39] Odinslayer: check the question again
[3:38:39] SeckSymbols: Max
[3:38:39] Zivs: he mentions it in the last part of the interview
[3:38:40] AlphasaurusRexx: the end of the interview
[3:38:40] abracka_: it was in the last thing he said in the interview
[3:38:43] futomara01: end of interview
[3:38:45] MWilco77: rewatch the end of the video
[3:38:45] Zivs: that would be the reason to the schedule change
[3:38:47] MrGharr: rewatch last question
[3:38:48] Fugazi811: holiday comment went along with mythic/heroic raid release
[3:38:48] Kale_Nd: the question he said at the end about the mythic at same time as normal and heroic
[3:38:49] awkswow: If there's not some power system to grind, I don't see why they wouldn't start the season immediately. People are going to get antsy.
[3:38:51] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee he said something during maxes interview about releasing them all at the same time because of the holidays
[3:38:58] abracka_: when ion asked max what he thought about all difficulties releasing
[3:39:03] HebbyB: he said sort of "you know with the holidays ..." sort of confirming that the release date is accurate?
[3:39:09] AlphasaurusRexx: he said he is in no way making an announcement, he is just trying to plan raid release around holidays
[3:39:30] Odinslayer: global release
[3:39:33] SeckSymbols: Hes gauging community interest on releasing all three difficulties at once
[3:39:39] dracullus: EU is Mon/Tue midnight
[3:39:49] SeckSymbols: Exactly
[3:40:04] Odinslayer: yea
[3:40:17] MrGharr: yea they could more easily fix mythic bugs
[3:40:35] Barzgrim: imo best would be start the raid in january
[3:40:37] awkswow: I think it'd make for a more exciting RWF too. You'd see guilds balancing doing splits and pushing prog in the same week
[3:40:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, that would be thousands of guilds then
[3:40:47] JustVek: raid usually releases 2 weeks after release. thats what they did for SL, Mythic would be released on 13th regardless
[3:40:47] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii

[3:41:06] JustVek: SL and Df wshould almost have same release timeline
[3:41:08] futomara01: Ion just distracting us with that question to implement gacha system
[3:41:11] Odinslayer: what game awards thing?
[3:41:13] silversquall88: Max even said it would be a balance of still doing splits and mythic and would make it more exciting
[3:41:16] Ertra: what happened at game awards?
[3:41:35] SLoPPYALieN: @JustVek That's what I was thinking... so maybe with him mention all 3 releasing at same time it is moving it back to the 6th instead.
[3:41:39] dracullus: Ion just give raiders Christmas and people are melting in comments xD
[3:41:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: It makes sense to me, to get it done before Christmas
[3:41:55] Layliah79: We'd get our Max level Vault a week earlier too
[3:42:04] JustVek: @SLoPPYALieN Which would make sense
[3:42:11] Tankraa: run splits on mythic
[3:42:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they are shooting for a 10 day race to world first, it can be done before then

[4:06:01] CraftyClaw: What about the upgrade items?
[4:06:03] Megoff: Are the UI settings in Dragonflight indepth enough to the point you wouldnt want a separate addon for it?
[4:06:08] doomester: @Towelliee why not, its working fine in Finaly fantsy which is really good for cuasuals @Towelliee
[4:06:10] SeckSymbols: It wasnt entirely shut down, Ion was just mentioning it wouldnt make sense for it to work how it currently works. So yes like you are saying, vendors towards the back half of the season
[4:06:26] Voidheim: I want the Dragonflight PrePatch already!!!
[4:06:53] SeckSymbols: @doomester FF isnt a gear game, its a glamour game. Gearing is entirely different between the two games for a reason

[4:08:07] SeckSymbols: @doomester I dont see how that has anything to do with what mine or your own comment was about but ok
[4:08:21] Voidheim: I am happy that they are continuing with the Shadowlands style progression, just opened it up to go work on any of the streams of storyline whenever you want
[4:08:53] SeckSymbols: @Voidheim You're still going to have to follow the story though
[4:08:58] SeckSymbols: Zone by zone
[4:09:04] Voidheim: yes
[4:09:16] KingSlayerYotam: shouldn't you get every appearance anyway? normal quests always gives the mog as reward anyway
[4:09:22] Voidheim: skipping around story would be kinda pointless.
[4:09:46] Theliahh: @KingSlayerYotam pretty sure these color sets are exclusive to renown
[4:09:48] SinicalDev: looks like adventurer/explorer type gear

[4:21:35] Vetyst: @kibil_burk Any time!
[4:21:52] belaham: they  need to change the DK one back to raising your ally as a ghoul for 45 seconds lol
[4:21:52] DoughBoi_Trev: There 100% needs to be at least 2 more classes with a Death Grip style grip, other than that tight now in game there is NOTHING that compares or is like a DK's Death Grip

[4:22:00] Vetyst: I dont see how a CR makes sense for shamans tho

[4:22:06] mrmanno14: miss when DK brezed players as zombies
[4:22:18] doomkry: that could go something like that for shaman
[4:22:24] DoughBoi_Trev: And also they need to make Mages able to do summoning portals
[4:22:36] strike879: magnetism totem
[4:22:47] DoughBoi_Trev: makes no sense on why Mages can't do summoning portals but can make portals to main cities
[4:23:12] WolfofWarSong: makes sense broze drake time manipulation
[4:23:23] LCS01: all healers shoudve brez, all tanks should have shield to instead of self heal

[4:23:35] IIINUCLEAR: boooo retail boooo
[4:23:40] HaloS23: @Towelliee well since Bronze flight is time related. its kinda like Mage time warp
[4:23:41] Molvonos: Towelliee Presents: Towelliee Reacts to Max's interview with Ion: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1573109979
[4:23:47] Vetyst: Makes even more sense if you compare it to the 2nd boss of the Nighthold. They did time magic which also increased/decreased haste/speed.
[4:23:50] kone_malone: As a Shaman main since BC im a lust snob - mad when mages and hunters got it, mad now lol. I just hope DF is a return to fun!

[4:25:02] SLoPPYALieN: LOL...
[4:25:03] UltraKSlaya: there should be more classes with summoning! sad that it is only warlock
[4:25:34] Velladyn: Avoid the lore community, they are NEVER happy about anything
[4:25:43] Haikonlol: They should make a summoning stone toy

[4:26:01] unholyrider69: MADGE
[4:26:06] unholyrider69: big madge
[4:26:12] spookychefkarolina: Blind entitlement
[4:26:18] Rabiahtaro132: "I'm mad because they are giving us flying early in the expansion"
[4:26:20] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: But they pay to play the game too @Towelliee if they feel like its crap they have the right just as much as anyone else to say something lol
[4:26:37] silversoidier: My wife says I should main DH because she liked the way he looked…
[4:26:38] nightknightjiujitsu: tryin to please man childs xD mission impossible
[4:26:44] HoboFighter2: Just wait for the Riot MMO, they gotta keep the League folks happy

[4:26:56] DoughBoi_Trev: Square Enix couldn't have just written a book instead of making a terrible Online MMO ???
[4:27:04] Ximora_and_Capy: nope
[4:27:07] Voidheim: nope
[4:27:11] skiller2b_: Towelliee, you're overreacting also..
[4:27:11] Voidheim: that's just toxic af

[4:27:37] NieIas: all the crybabies and haters will come back for DF anyways just watch preach etc come back soon LUL
[4:27:37] nightknightjiujitsu: ppl unhappy in life so they project into their "happy" place

[4:28:03] Rabiahtaro132: It's like saying when you order food, you have the right to complain to a manager whenever it's missing 2 fries
[4:28:19] Mecabeast: oh God I just heard my dad's voice in my head say idc who started it I'm finishing it
[4:28:20] Ealdfox: LUL
[4:28:23] SeckSymbols: @NieIas This is the reaciton that gets people to call you a child, which is exactly how you are acting like right now
[4:28:23] nightknightjiujitsu: i am ur dad!
[4:28:28] Haikonlol: @towelliee how big is the new dragonflight zone compared to all the shadowland zones combined, is it about the same? Or bigger?
[4:28:30] SLoPPYALieN: My dad's johnson is bigger than your johnson
[4:28:32] spookychefkarolina: towSip towSip
[4:28:44] doomkry: my dad is John Activision so you are donezo buddy EZ
[4:28:50] mrmanno14: my dad has a charizard
[4:28:52] nightknightjiujitsu: questception!
[4:28:58] bob_tables: is this standard UI in dragonflight? Looks quite good actually
[4:29:14] Fuzzy_17: @Towelliee how is dragonfligh impression and profession new system feeling?
[4:29:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, it does seem larger than Northrend
[4:29:27] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols but are they wrong?
[4:29:37] Theliahh: every zone in DF is a banger so far
[4:29:40] nightknightjiujitsu: noooope!
[4:29:41] nightknightjiujitsu: lol
[4:29:47] Funderik: DF is big in terms of size and height.
[4:29:51] Haikonlol: Yeah the dragonriding looks like it is reallt big actually
[4:29:53] jamiboiy: just get me alpha and challenge accepted Kappa
[4:29:53] siliconwafer: the zones are prob the reason i'll start playing wow again
[4:29:53] Theliahh: D:
[4:29:57] siliconwafer: they look great
[4:30:00] nightknightjiujitsu: just fresh
[4:30:01] Theliahh: ohnaran is my fav KEKW
[4:30:07] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols Are they right? Calling people like Preach a crybaby and a hater when Preach himself has stated he has always hoped WoW would get better. Does that make Preach a crybaby and a hater?
[4:30:08] nightknightjiujitsu: most look good tho
[4:30:12] NieIas: i think they meant in terms of size/art
[4:30:13] Shiekrunner: its just nagrand
[4:30:33] Funderik: i like the open plains, reminds me of og wow, big open spaces
[4:30:34] nightknightjiujitsu: art carry yet again
[4:31:04] Arcedscyth: are those new enemy castbars customizable

[4:31:07] akia03: still waiting to see what the solo endgame is going to be in df
[4:31:16] Mecabeast: mechgon best zone
[4:31:30] akia03: like islands thorgast and such
[4:31:31] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols I wasn't necessarily responding to Preach specifically. I think theres been a lot of people who have shit on WoW the past couple of years that are just there to be "angry"
[4:31:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Solo players can do the elemental invasions
[4:31:33] Vetyst: Why not solo M+ dungeons
[4:31:36] Tybow0811: So we thinking beta that beginning of next month and pre-patch end of oct- early nov?
[4:31:43] spookychefkarolina: No way you haven’t found lava fishing towel! I’m shocked
[4:31:55] awkswow: The expansion feature is dragonriding, not something like torghast
[4:32:00] akia03: so not much for solo players?
[4:32:08] HebbyB: seems like there is lots for solo players?
[4:32:19] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols I think people have had every right to be angry with long patch cycles, lawsuits, lack of communication with the community (until recently). That doesn't make them a hater, that makes them justifiably angry.
[4:32:20] awkswow: "Solo" MMO players. Always makes me scratch my head.
[4:32:21] nightknightjiujitsu: i go for old content if i want solo experiences
[4:32:55] dewking93: what about the renown thats solo player content
[4:32:58] NieIas: do you think we'll get more interviews because beta is right around the corner?
[4:33:06] SLoPPYALieN: The One Gravestone (Saaw'fsahdjhsfaj Gravestone) that spawned the Shade of blaaaah dragon is doing the same thing, allowing you to spawn him consistently to get the rep item.
[4:33:08] akia03: have you seen the normal wow player ingame im not grouping with that
[4:33:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: @awkswow It is a minority in the games, but solo content is stuff for everyone to do if their friends aren't on
[4:33:23] nightknightjiujitsu: climb on!
[4:33:29] PokerFaceMoose: theres a difference between solo player content and solo player end game
[4:33:34] awkswow: is ice fishing somehow different than "click the bob?"
[4:33:38] HebbyB: I think as a solo player (at least I do when all my friends quit D: ) you are content to play alone in an MMO BUT not have access to the best gear. I think that's ok.
[4:33:51] SeckSymbols: @awkswow Exactly, just because a game is an MMO, doesn't mean someone cannot have content they can do solo
[4:33:55] SlippieSlik: You are the essence of Sharknado with that trinket! omg i laugh every time it procs
[4:33:58] Mourningztar: Im going to have such a greasy beard with this xpac
[4:34:00] JStevenson: did they confirm that renown will be account wide from the beginning?
[4:34:15] nightknightjiujitsu: mog and mounts endgame.. then final form endgame!.. fishing!\
[4:34:15] SeckSymbols: @awkswow Island Sanctuaries in FF14 are a recent example of something I can do solo while queuing for duty finder.
[4:34:18] strike879: i think he might be talking more about lvl 70 content
[4:34:36] awkswow: @awkswow Yeah that stuff has been around in WoW forever. You do things like material farm, rep farm, etc etc. I meant it's always a head scratcher when people want some sort of giga endgame feature for solo players.
[4:34:38] belfastcl: @SeckSymbols eso has lots of solo content too
[4:34:45] Fuzzy_17: doing end game as solo sucks, even now i can't get a single invite for m+ as ret pala 280 ilvl
[4:34:47] Jeanssi: farm a shit ton of Primal infusions from rares and materials for crafting, you can get 5x 416 pieces
[4:34:49] Jango_: Challenging solo content
[4:34:51] NieIas: do you think we'll get more interviews because beta is right around the corner? @Towelliee
[4:34:56] nightknightjiujitsu: ima mog whore :)
[4:35:03] Jango_: I loved scenarios in MoP
[4:35:20] LCS01: @Towelliee do u think tank monk will receive nerf?
[4:35:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: For solo players it's better than it is now, being stuck with 252 gear and a couple of 285 pieces
[4:35:33] Kisswani: sloot interview next ? towPog
[4:35:39] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols Ehh. If you are justifiably angry than unsub. Do something that matters. Yelling on twitter or forums yet youre still paying for the sub? kinda ass backwards imo. Those people are the people that arent angry they just like the mob mentality.
[4:35:50] Corgi_Bark: When are we thinking beta release? Now that they're testing 70 and have released all the zones...
[4:35:58] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols Which is exactly what I did, I did unsub for about 8 months between July of last year and April of this year
[4:36:02] captain69: when will be the pre patch whats ur guess on that?
[4:36:03] maxkule: Did Towelliee watch the interview yet?
[4:36:05] nightknightjiujitsu: cave?
[4:36:09] HaloS23: @Towelliee any more with you? i think you do well at them!
[4:36:13] LCS01: @maxkule ye
[4:36:13] ohnot___her: People will bitch on twitter about how much they hate it yet there logging in right after that tweet is sent
[4:36:17] oxidexd: @maxkule yes...vod
[4:36:23] Fuzzy_17: @wEiRdO_dUdE only for the beginning of expansion
[4:36:33] abracka_: you can complain about something and still play it chat.
[4:36:34] strike879: as melee your better of making your own groups its like 20% tanks 10% healers the rest dps
[4:36:37] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols Telling people to just "unsub" if you are angry doesnt fix the problem with the game. Being vocal about the issues is exactly what got blizzard into the spot of being more player friendly recently. So no, don't just unsub.
[4:36:42] nightknightjiujitsu: need a degree to find wow caves imo lol
[4:36:56] DevilSpire: hope i get beta...want to check out DF before it launches
[4:36:57] Ethian: @abracka_ That's Wow for the last 10 years
[4:37:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's going to take solo players 6 months to fully gear up with the epics from elemental invasions, but it's doable
[4:37:15] P0RTH0S: P0RTH0S subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 95 months! Hammers Up
[4:37:19] SeckSymbols: @abracka_ Exactly, people saying you cant complain and play at the same time are fucking weirdos
[4:37:33] SeckSymbols: You can still find some enjoyment while noticing and being vocal about problems
[4:37:35] P0RTH0S: Living the dream
[4:37:56] nightknightjiujitsu: lol
[4:38:01] realCapta1nKirk: realCapta1nKirk subscribed with Prime. 
[4:38:07] P0RTH0S: You get me through the workday
[4:38:08] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols Im not saying being vocal isnt a good thing, it 100% is. BUT the people that are sitting there ripping devs apart, not giving constructive feedback on what needs to be changed and just screaming in the void AND playing the game is ridiculous to me
[4:38:19] Theliahh: im very happy with season 4 tbh

[4:38:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Report the node!
[4:38:41] Xerevil: u can fly to it?
[4:38:42] rantre208: i am not playing right now.  Probably renew in a month or two
[4:38:43] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols You are describing an EXTREME minority as if it is a majority of people doing it.
[4:38:50] Mecabeast: I'm on the happier end with the game cause I still wanna play every day not happy that guildies want to raid log
[4:39:01] Xerevil: can't you land on the node itself?
[4:39:16] DevilSpire: @Towelliee ya SL just doesn't grab my attention like BFA did
[4:39:17] SeckSymbols: Multiple MMO enjoyers are the real gigachads
[4:39:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: If people have feedback for the game, now is the time to post about it in the proper forum
[4:39:36] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: @Mecabeast New guild maybe IDK lol
[4:39:50] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols How do you know that? you see it all over twitter and reddit?
[4:39:52] nightknightjiujitsu: thats what i was thinkin^
[4:40:06] Defenzor: Morning all
[4:40:09] nightknightjiujitsu: if ur guild is the issue talk to em or leave
[4:40:11] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols You people who are most vocal have always been the minority.
[4:40:26] ohnot___her: and theres still people out there like that, Idc if its a small or a giant  population
[4:40:34] Bruteforcez: I'm addicted! -T1
[4:40:40] zemmersaus: u also need to buy expac
[4:40:42] halflotus: revamp of UI
[4:41:03] nightknightjiujitsu: i just wanna (blade)dance!
[4:41:07] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols see I thought we were having a nice conversation until you decide to loop me in as "you people". I for one have enjoyed SL and am looking forward to DF.
[4:41:20] akia03: or do like some people i know buy the xpac install it and refund it later in store for money back
[4:41:34] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols The "you people" was meant to be "The people" and I hadn't gone back to correct it. But take it personally please
[4:41:34] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:41:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think this can break the sales record that Shadowlands had
[4:41:46] TheRealCaptTrips: @towelliee Do you think druids are finally going to get some love?
[4:41:50] HoboFighter2: Based on some stuff Ion said I am very interested in how they will try and bring Dragon riding forward past Dragonflight, seems like they will need to come up with some creative ideas not to piss people off
[4:42:02] awkswow: I'm still nervous that the "no borrowed power" folks aren't going to enjoy the game without a power based subsystem as much as they think they will
[4:42:28] awkswow: There's something to be said about those small dopamine hits you get from power grinds.
[4:42:41] DarkviperTV: Are we supposed to get new healthbars soon?
[4:43:02] Jango_: Blizzard hates feral :(
[4:43:04] bwoods79: @Towelliee hey can you use your contacts for this idea. With professions if you want to craft something that take other crafted items from same profession and you have mats it will auto craft those as well..or just use the mats
[4:43:04] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols Well as we have been replying in threads, and youre not just typing it out in chat. But I get it.
[4:43:26] skymercii: @Jango_ you say that but same as SV they are doing really well rn
[4:43:29] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols Still a vocal minority
[4:43:44] c0mmander_starscream: Random guild leader, "Get gud or get kicked" Mythic plus 2022
[4:43:47] Thenickradice: feral felt good during MOP 🥲
[4:43:50] ohnot___her: @SeckSymbols Minority or not, still people out there
[4:43:57] Thenickradice: BibleThump
[4:44:00] Jango_: @bloodyreapr  they are not on par with most of the other dps in the game
[4:44:08] Jango_: thats a fact not opinion
[4:44:17] TheRealCaptTrips: Druids need a complete overhaul imo
[4:44:24] SeckSymbols: But the entire conversation was around people who are belligerently angry whose opinions arent really meaningful because they are bitching just to bitch
[4:44:28] Thenickradice: I do hope feral gets a nice buff in DF
[4:44:34] nightknightjiujitsu: lol bears go bur atm
[4:44:46] TheRealCaptTrips: I love my Druid but being behind every single class in the game feels bad.
[4:44:51] skymercii: @Jango_ i have a few feral druids that can do more dps then the meta dps specs
[4:45:06] nightknightjiujitsu: oh yeah they op
[4:45:12] Jango_: @bloodyreapr  once again, overall they need a revamp and do not perform
[4:45:19] TheEndIsNear777: dragonflight pvp will be = 180k hp 80k crits BibleThump
[4:45:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: I have used bears for a long time, their tree is fine
[4:45:22] nightknightjiujitsu: i made one to meme on ppl in pvp xD
[4:45:23] strike879: @towelliee like if you want to make a bag but no bolts of cloth it auto makes the bolts to make the bag
[4:45:29] awkswow: They've already taken some cuts at warrior. They'll start chopping tall trees soon
[4:45:38] nightknightjiujitsu: bears r stroink af
[4:45:59] skymercii: @Jango_ i understand what you're getting at i do miss WoD feral  thats also the last time i touched feral
[4:46:01] SilkeySmooth: blizard doesnt really care about balance just metas per season
[4:46:22] Jango_: My uncle works at nintendo and said feral is fine, gtfo

[4:46:30] nightknightjiujitsu: its impossbile to balance to be fair
[4:46:54] skymercii: @SilkeySmooth there will ALWAYS be a meta
[4:47:16] maxkule: @Towelliee Do you think Ion basically confirmed that the end of Nov release date was accurate based on his "Holidays are coming up" Raid difficulty question with Max?
[4:47:18] Frank4LuLz: @Towelliee  Boomer Blast is Horchata Flavor
[4:47:19] nightknightjiujitsu: like im saying im "fine" xD
[4:47:21] strike879: feral is just purrfect
[4:47:23] c0mmander_starscream: EA Sports "It's in da game"
[4:47:25] TheEndIsNear777: its easy to balance just don't do 3 shots :)
[4:47:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ferals are usually strong with single target damage
[4:47:34] nightknightjiujitsu: lol
[4:47:35] JackedDown: D:
[4:47:37] awkswow: Didn't feral pop off in single target in season 1 shadowlands? Like literally the best single target spec
[4:47:37] Frank4LuLz: what????????????????????????????????????
[4:47:38] nightknightjiujitsu: ez to balance?
[4:47:39] cruzeal: i won't hold my breath for feral to be op
[4:47:44] dreamkore: Feral just needs the ability to commit to a playstyle, and not having so many useless conduit talents eating up 10 total points
[4:47:56] ThinkBucket: @awkswow you mean convoke popped off
[4:47:56] Frank4LuLz: horchat a nd rum is so good
[4:47:57] Digglio: how tf you hate horchata
[4:48:04] akia03: fishing?
[4:48:05] SwitchBlue1337: wtf
[4:48:06] Rexy95: fishing
[4:48:09] Jango_: @dreamkore i agree
[4:48:12] SwitchBlue1337: horchata is so good!
[4:48:12] strike879: maybe fishing?
[4:48:13] MrHI6HWAY: you just dont like the  texture or flavor?
[4:48:22] SwitchBlue1337: such a nutritional beverage
[4:48:38] JackedDown: Well yeah a horchata beer sounds awful.
[4:48:38] Egzolinas: Hello @Towelliee thank god it is Friday :)
[4:48:47] Muaytitus: horchata is good, but horchata flavored things are gross
[4:48:50] Frank4LuLz: fine......how about ols school Orange Julius from the mall @Towelliee
[4:48:51] MrHI6HWAY: fair enough man
[4:48:55] LearnedSomething: TGIF
[4:48:58] spookychefkarolina: @switchblue1337 as a Mexican Venezuelan I can say, horchata is a hard no for me
[4:49:07] dewking93: its my work week monday :(
[4:49:26] nightknightjiujitsu: everyday is saturday!

[4:49:56] dewking93: @spookychefkarolina  you could say that
[4:49:57] awkswow: Is Cuban food even spicy?
[4:50:00] DanielMorenoMiniatures: Cubans dont eat spicy

[4:50:54] SmallzzIV: Just had cubanos this week for lunch... delicious
[4:50:59] spookychefkarolina: Cubans love their flavor. My BFF is Cuban and they love their Sofrito which is like a holy trinity
[4:51:01] Jango_: i hate flavor gimmick beers
[4:51:07] dean14021989: In the new dlc do you still have to craft leganderie items?
[4:51:14] trerandall: give me my Guinness I'm good 👍😊

[4:52:54] spookychefkarolina: Did they twirl your ropa vieja? Lmfao LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:53:00] DanielMorenoMiniatures: Cuban food is more influenced by Spain
[4:53:13] DanielMorenoMiniatures: the spicy food is from the native Aztecs
[4:53:19] DanielMorenoMiniatures: in Mexico
[4:53:20] spookychefkarolina: @vlad_tv87 I believe so

[4:59:57] notColt45: They get more adult as the actors do
[5:00:03] PhrykeFinn: I think Chamber was my least favorite
[5:00:06] Jokervenom1978: They start getting much better with the 3rd movie.
[5:00:07] mintcookie_vajankle: Harry Potter gets really, really good near the end. Last few movies are worth the drag of the first four.
[5:00:15] NieIas: oi harry
[5:00:16] Technogre: spoiler alert voldemort is Harry's father Kappa
[5:00:27] loscarrafaust: i

[5:01:28] fewyn: because Love
[5:01:29] Reaghol: thats last time
[5:01:29] rockhell12: you find out in a later movie
[5:01:30] Featherbow: cause he lives there
[5:01:30] Neziko: It's Summertime. He has no other home
[5:01:31] Funderik: no choice
[5:01:31] 1llum1n471: 'll explain that later
[5:01:32] BurtMacklin410: there is a reason but they dont really say in the movies
[5:01:32] lel3owski: Azkaban is the best easily, alfonso cuaron directed
[5:01:34] PhrykeFinn: They're his legal guardians for summer lol
[5:01:35] Jokervenom1978: They explain it in the books
[5:01:37] CommanderKrano: there is a reason
[5:01:40] abracka_: it all comes full circle by the end
[5:01:42] Darwoo: he has a sexual relationship with the other brother
[5:01:42] evad1971: Summer home from school
[5:01:43] DarkviperTV: It's his "home"
[5:01:43] mintcookie_vajankle: It'd be spoilers if we told you. There is a reason why Dumbledore brought HP to that house.
[5:01:43] 1llum1n471: it'll explain that later
[5:01:43] Malarick: explained in a future movie.  I think Half Blood Ptince
[5:01:44] SilkeySmooth: those people are his only family

[5:01:52] twinkieruler95: because its the safest place outside of the magic world
[5:01:53] spookychefkarolina: He has to go home for summer break Towel
[5:01:58] Ogumel: Because of a magical enchantment that protects him.
[5:01:59] c0mmander_starscream: Yeah fuck those aunt and uncle
[5:02:00] Quojin: legal guardians
[5:02:10] Luxicake: "every movie he's there bro" has only watched first 2 movies KEKW
[5:02:10] BurtMacklin410: has something to do with his aunt and love and his mom but they dont go into it in the movies
[5:02:23] Thenickradice: had to lock him in the past for his own good. he is a horcrux and at any moment could kill everyone too. I would despise him too haha
[5:02:29] Thenickradice: closet*
[5:02:31] Hurtallpoptarts: I think the Lore reason was mostly because the rules but also perspective if i remember correctly. So he never grew up and became a piece o shit
[5:02:33] Gregadeaux: he loves his cousin dudders that's why
[5:02:42] fbirobertmueller805: 1-8? I just got here
[5:02:46] Jango_: lol
[5:02:50] spookychefkarolina: I has no other next of kin and the sh*** part is that he has all these mentors that could take him in …. But just don’t. Love HP but it’s a huge plot hole.
[5:02:52] Ogumel: No, not that. That's another thing. As long as he can consider the Dursley's home a 'home' for him, there's a ward that protects him from hostile wizards.
[5:02:57] MrHI6HWAY: you dont see them after like 4 i think
[5:02:57] BurtMacklin410: its a good question for a movie watcher but makes more sense in the books
[5:03:03] Gregadeaux: you're never too old for hogwarts
[5:03:04] Frank4LuLz: 18?
[5:03:07] Quojin: never
[5:03:09] Jokervenom1978: its basically high school
[5:03:10] c0mmander_starscream: Towelliee asking questions from 2003
[5:03:16] fbirobertmueller805: Wtf you cheep @&”#%
[5:03:20] fewyn: it's basically middle/high school jammed together
[5:03:25] Wholoveswaffles: 11-18
[5:03:31] Featherbow: I'm not a book vs movie purest, some movies do a good job of condensing the story, but the potter books are much better than the movies. They switch too many things around in the movies that confuse people on the story
[5:03:32] JackedDown: KEKW
[5:03:35] fewyn: they start at 11 and end at i think 18?
[5:03:36] c0mmander_starscream: towOof
[5:03:40] spookychefkarolina: Never, you’re never too old. towStop towIt
[5:04:07] Wholoveswaffles: Harry Potter is great to watch at Christmas :)
[5:04:08] Neziko: Hagrid is chill
[5:04:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: There's a new Harry Potter game that looks alright, they are doing cool stuff with the wizard combat
[5:04:14] Gregadeaux: didjaevermakeanythinhappen
[5:04:15] DarkviperTV: Yea he is the best.
[5:04:21] JackedDown: Hagrid is a G
[5:04:23] abracka_: "i should not have said that" - hagrid every movie
[5:04:30] c0mmander_starscream: Wait till you get to Ralph Fieins
[5:04:36] c0mmander_starscream: as voldermort
[5:04:36] spookychefkarolina: @wholoveswaffles wrong, it’s a halloween movie idk why it’s been absorbed by Xmas LUL LUL
[5:04:37] sipilde: It starts childish, but to more you go, the more it gets serious
[5:04:40] strike879: i like the harry potter world but cannon has too many plot holes so i mainly read fanfiction where they solve those
[5:04:40] love_eggplant: have you even seen the hogwarts legacy playstation 15 min trailer?
[5:04:56] Quojin: you mean like Tom Harding lol
[5:05:00] Zoludar: atleast you realized u need help
[5:05:07] spookychefkarolina: What are secrets?
[5:05:45] c0mmander_starscream: Tom Hardy would of made a better Voldermort
[5:06:00] Jango_: no shot
[5:06:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Watch out for the casters!
[5:06:18] drhoser: I haven't looked it up yet but is WindWalker any good?
[5:06:21] spookychefkarolina: @c0mmander_starscream blasphemy! towRee
[5:06:28] AlphasaurusRexx: @c0mmander_starscream bruh youre just gonna dunk on my boi voldemort like that?
[5:06:37] Jango_: Raphael Fiennes did a fantastic job
[5:06:54] spookychefkarolina: Exceptional
[5:07:09] GrazzloTV: have you run halls of infusion yet?
[5:07:15] lucid_wow: is this the zone neltharus is in?
[5:07:24] Mecabeast: ooo kelani found some interesting stuff on alpha per one of his recent videos
[5:08:01] Mecabeast: some auto casting and auto targeting stuff and companion dragon riding things
[5:08:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Statue! LUL
[5:09:44] dakoko: Harry potter's mom sacrifice her self to safe harry and that protection is in the blood, and since harry's aunt is a sister to harry's mom, he is safe there as long he is a minor.
[5:10:02] 1llum1n471: ^^^
[5:10:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: lava mammoth
[5:10:10] Mecabeast: auto casting examples would be like a mage casting frostbite could just hold down the key bind for frost bolt and they'd auto cast it with the setting enabled
[5:10:12] raldrik: we see that and we are all just like umm mount please
[5:11:33] toxicmasculinity69: rather not have every mount than every conduit power
[5:11:42] HaloS23: im still trying to collect all the previous dragon mounts.... stuck on Onyixa and dragon soul

[5:47:15] SonofHorus82: poor dragon has to carry a fat fuckin cow around so I understand it losing energy right there.

[5:48:38] caffeas988: sure
[5:48:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: It won't be the same without that painful rep grinding for flying
[5:48:57] QQisLIVE: Jesus. Avo trees take like 10 years to grow and harvest lol
[5:49:23] criarojasmunoz: I don't get it, you guys have a rework of a mechanic that has been forgotten forever for a long time and you already want to go back? the idea is to want them to improve dragon riding for me... with love :)
[5:50:10] the_cube: What are the glyphs for?
[5:50:21] tristalien: do you think they will add the dragon riding mechanic to all flying mounts in the future?
[5:51:02] lel3owski: lol
[5:51:08] Templexx: people are weird
[5:51:10] criarojasmunoz: lol
[5:51:15] DeanoTV: classic andies ResidentSleeper old men just wanna walk with a cane
[5:51:22] Xaviwan078: dragon riding looks really cool for me cant wait for dragonflight
[5:51:23] pWall_E: cant he just use the ground mount if he wanted too
[5:51:25] PanoramicPanda: i wonder how it'll look with dozens-hundreds of folks dragon riding around at once
[5:51:30] Shattermare: Dragonriding will be way too much fun
[5:51:37] imbatree: some ppl say you need to reset your pw to see the alpha when you got one??
[5:51:37] spookychefkarolina: Nobody ever likes change. Mists was hated on like this and now people regret it.
[5:51:39] Mecabeast: I mean dragonflying doesn't let you afk fly by hitting auto run
[5:51:39] imbatree: is that true
[5:51:40] stillkold: will that force flying to all zone, or still require achieves?
[5:51:43] andr4ws: I won't lie... This area looks so good and finally... wow-like.
[5:52:00] Thoreya: ahhh i hate everything ahhh
[5:52:02] DeanoTV: classic andies ResidentSleeper old men just wanna walk with a cane @Towelliee
[5:52:12] Neziko: People love to find dumb things to complain about
[5:52:12] MR_WYTE: I haven't been following very closely, what actually are the new features of DF (excluding dragon riding)?\
[5:52:13] SauceFu: People just like to complain for the sake of complaining
[5:52:18] SonofHorus82: then like... dont fucking play it? Go cuddle your full body waifu pillow and play some FF14.
[5:52:18] Xaviwan078: some peaple just love to hate whatever it is
[5:52:18] NieIas: flying does make the world feel smaller tho.
[5:52:24] NieIas: but those zones are huge
[5:52:32] Jokervenom1978: Not gonna lie. Im concerned about dragon riding too.
[5:52:57] UltiCarnagee: Back in My Day I climbed up Dun Morogh uphill in the snow to get to work BabyRage
[5:52:57] onybear: People just want to argue to argue…I just have flashbacks to having to wait for lvl 40 for ground mount ….I’m good, I will take dragon rising
[5:52:57] Thoreya: flying has been in the game since 2007 idk how its still a talking point 15 years later LUL LUL
[5:52:59] spookychefkarolina: @sonofhorus82 exactly
[5:53:03] onybear: *riding
[5:53:04] pWall_E: I think people feel like they will be bad at it
[5:53:08] zemmersaus: boomer mindset
[5:53:10] Rob3phones: Dragon riding is one of the things im looking forward to the most in DF
[5:53:10] Dankind64: i think it will be so good that if normal flying mounts were in dragon isles people would still use dragons
[5:53:11] valianya: The thing is dragonriding is a great exploration minigame.  But its not good for precision farming, or for getting to a destination far off without making it effort to get there
[5:53:16] cowthulhu1: id rather just ride my mounts.
[5:53:16] propwash80: @towelliee does rising from kick feels good as a BM monk?
[5:53:33] DoughBoi_Trev: @towelliee I think it's because it's not what people were expecting the dragon riding to be, they thought it was going to be flying flying and not a timed flight mechanic
[5:53:46] SpyCrabbo: a friend of mine really hates the gw2 mounts and is concernced about dragonriding as well
[5:53:59] MR_WYTE: DF website only has dragonriding, Evokers, and dungeons/raids listed for new expansion features. Thought there was something else?
[5:54:04] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:54:05] Shattermare: Monk should have more burst tbf
[5:54:10] valth: i can understand dragonriding. looks fun but sometimes i just want to get on my flying mount and cross a zone semi afk not having to pay attention that much
[5:54:37] bagrain: are prot warriors still looking good?

[5:55:19] nothumbgamer_ttv: @Towelliee have you tried ret paladin yet, also what are your thoughts about paladins getting battleres?
[5:55:20] valianya: @Mr_wyte total rework of talents and major professions
[5:55:33] propwash80: @towelliee do you agree the the devs should make each class the best at something so that each tank brings something unique? do you think it's possible?
[5:55:42] MR_WYTE: @Thoreya - can't tell if you're being sarcastic. I was actually being inquisitive/curious.
[5:55:46] Dankind64: LOL
[5:55:48] MR_WYTE: Thanks all.
[5:56:26] SpyCrabbo: @propwash80 isn't that already the case? for tanks and healers at least

[5:58:13] spookychefkarolina: It’s going to be amazing towel
[5:58:16] Daidraco: Hey Towelliee - Are world quests REQUIRED this expansion if all you're interested in is the big three and not over world stuff?
[5:58:19] notColt45: He's replaced in the 3rd movie I think Sadge
[5:58:19] Ensanee: the actor died i think in the 2nd movie, they got a new dumbledore the 3rd one
[5:58:25] Featherbow: the actor in the first movie was better, but he sadly passed
[5:58:33] valianya: None until picking covenant at end of leveling.  Only alts got renown while leveling because they pick covenant early
[5:58:36] trivotix: oh damn I never knew that
[5:58:36] SpyCrabbo: @propwash80 dh tank isn't even out yet for alpha and as for druid, tuning isn't over yet
[5:58:37] futomara01: og dumble or next gen dumble
[5:58:41] DeanoTV: Nah i prefer the newer dumbledore
[5:58:45] spookychefkarolina: LOL oh no mind blown
[5:58:56] SonofHorus82: Richard Harris. He unfortunately passed away after the second movie and was replaced with Michael Gambon.
[5:59:07] NieIas: WQ are main source of rep no?
[5:59:08] Gregadeaux: there is another dumbledoor
[5:59:16] Featherbow: nobody is talking about jude law dumbledore lol
[5:59:18] ScionGaming: besides the balancing do you think DF is ready for launch?
[5:59:27] futomara01: original series
[5:59:27] notColt45: We don't mention those films

[5:59:31] Snaps8: OG from books 1-2
[5:59:33] giggz91: johny dep
[5:59:35] Featherbow: there are two different actors for dumbledore in the movies
[5:59:36] spookychefkarolina: Michael Gambon wasn’t as bad as people tout it to be
[5:59:38] Mavarlous: OG Dumbledore!
[5:59:38] smashwow: OG actor vs timeline OG
[5:59:42] valianya: There were two old dumbledores

[5:59:53] TAYLOR_HAM: Justice for Johnny
[5:59:54] HeatherJC83: richard harris in 1 and 2 michael gambon in 3-7
[5:59:59] Ensanee: they used 2 dumbledores in the harry potter movies, the original dumbledore died in the 2nd movie in real life, and was replaced in the 3rd
[6:00:01] abracka_: it's all the same dumbledore
[6:00:04] melutz77: Same guy
[6:00:06] Vile_: If he hasn’t watched 3-7, he won’t know.
[6:00:06] smashwow: younger version
[6:00:07] WolfofWarSong: theres 2
[6:00:10] DarkviperTV: same guy
[6:00:11] Hurtallpoptarts: Same guy
[6:00:12] TheFox0228: the first dumbledoor actor passed away, i thought?
[6:00:14] Featherbow: we're talking about ACTORS Towelliee lol
[6:00:14] NieIas: youre trolling right LUL
[6:00:16] HeatherJC83: jude law plays younger verson of dumbldor
[6:00:17] superb0y: @Towelliee have you had any issues with Bloating while on Advanced.gg? I just finished the starter kit, Mango was bomb, andthe Fruit Punch
[6:00:17] Scoodles91: actor is diffrent
[6:00:18] SonofHorus82: yeah it's the same dude
[6:00:19] CCG_337: dont get confused, just wwait until 3rd movie
[6:00:19] CrossedUpTV: the actor died in the earlier harry movies
[6:00:20] audrock7: its the same dude
[6:00:20] Urebaldd: So many dumbles
[6:00:23] Twizted23faith: 2 actors that played him in the potter movies
[6:00:24] abracka_: they've had three different actors though. jude law played in the fantastic beasts, then the dubmledore you see in the 1st and 2nd movies gets replaced in the 3rd moviee
[6:00:25] notColt45: You'll get it once you see the rest of the book movies
[6:00:26] propwash80: @spycrabbo I know I guess I meant more generally. it would be good if all tank were comparable in performance but each one would be the best at something
[6:00:27] zz1m: there are  two actors that played old dumbledore
[6:00:30] Artiiz: Fantastic Beasts is just literally before harry potter universe
[6:00:43] yshtola1337: some intresting stuff at gamescom event this year so far
[6:00:45] HeatherJC83: whose maximu surrelius lol
[6:00:48] Ensanee: hes trolling
[6:00:52] Mecabeast: so first 2 Harry Potter movies is different than others as the actor died, fantastic beasts they recast Dumbledore because they wanted a younger guy
[6:00:54] Dankind64: there are 2 old guy versions of him, then jude law
[6:00:55] futomara01: you prefer 1 and 2/ 3-7 or jude law
[6:00:57] valianya: No, HP main movies happen decades later than Fantastic Beasts
[6:00:57] Jokervenom1978: No hes not lol
[6:00:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: ask him again after he watches the 3rd movie
[6:01:04] abracka_: @Ensanee he's not, he hasn't started the 3rd movie yet so he doesn't know
[6:01:08] yardmmada: Why is Dragonflight so pretty?
[6:01:15] pWall_E: He said hes got 6 more movies he hasnt seen Michael Gambon yet
[6:01:44] Mecabeast: fantastic beasts is like in the 20s/30s while Harry Potter is during the 90s
[6:01:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: the only answer is og dumbledore though

[6:03:51] LearnedSomething: I haven't watched any of the fantastic beasts ones
[6:03:53] smashwow: timeline wise yeah
[6:03:57] tronbadgames: you think people should watch episode 1 of starwars first?
[6:04:03] PvtHudson093: fantastic beasts assumes that you have watched the harry potter films first
[6:04:07] lorddrekken: Any druid updates yet from Blizzard?
[6:04:12] NieIas: @Towelliee house of dragons was renewed for season 2 today, big hit
[6:04:23] barefoot_on_bricks: @shutupRoman uhm no.
[6:04:41] abracka_: jude law plays the fantastic beasts dumbledore, richard harris plays the dumbledore in the first two harry potter movies, and then michael gambon takes over in the 3rd until the last movie
[6:05:05] DeanoTV: michael gambon is best
[6:05:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: can't be much worse then that last season of GoT
[6:05:20] PvtHudson093: Soom TM
[6:05:35] smashwow: going to lovingly lay druids and priests in a grave Kappa
[6:05:35] criarojasmunoz: if you saw "fantastic beasts first", then it might degenerate a bit the relationships in "harry potter saga" lol
[6:05:49] MILESkg21: LOTR next week FeelsGoodMan
[6:05:51] barefoot_on_bricks: Hopefully archaeology gets an update in 10.1
[6:06:02] preds4343: I hope the no Dragonriding thing at Valdrakken is a bug
[6:06:03] BoezIRL: sorry i was driving, so in the end was it the glyph on top of the tower?
[6:06:08] Daidraco: I would think it would be in a cave? lol
[6:06:27] tronbadgames: those colors are so bright on that brown backdrop
[6:06:39] stillkold: is this DF beta?
[6:06:45] JasperCalico: @stillkold alpha
[6:06:47] strike879: likely the same as the garrison mage tower portals
[6:06:51] barefoot_on_bricks: @stillkold no
[6:06:54] mannyalfredo: @Towelliee is Archeology making a comeback in DF?
[6:07:19] PanoramicPanda: @BoezIRL was a glyph in a tree
[6:07:20] JasperCalico: Archeology prob coming back in last patch prince565Hehe
[6:07:46] barefoot_on_bricks: @mannyalfredo Ion said they weren't happy with the state of it currently. So fingers crossed 10.1 or maybe 10.2?
[6:07:51] Daidraco: Iirc from another stream, some of the "higher' stuff (im assuming like lava fishing, mining nodes etc.) are around the elemental invasions in those time blocks
[6:08:23] valianya: I hope they do something with it this expansion.  How can they have an Explorer's League/Reliquary joint expedition and do nothing with Archaeology the whole expansion
[6:08:25] zenFX_: @barefoot_on_bricks they said they wont do anything with it this expansion
[6:08:43] yardmmada: QUEST ITEM
[6:08:52] barefoot_on_bricks: @zenFX_ oh really? I didn't know that :(
[6:09:00] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they should commit to including archeology in a future Dragonflight patch
[6:09:01] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  QUEST ITEM
[6:09:02] ArcaneMaki: action item
[6:09:04] trivotix: The graphics look a bit enhanced

[6:09:49] barefoot_on_bricks: @zenFX_ thats fair enough
[6:10:24] Sielu11628: How's Dragonriding feeling after getting more talents?
[6:10:28] yardmmada: Have you noticed, the mammoths in the plains have different tusk variants? A cool detail.
[6:10:32] Winterhearted: Haven't played WOW since BFA. Just got ShL for free from Blizzard. Is it worth to come back? How long will it take to catch up?
[6:10:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: 2 weeks until new Cobra Kai season
[6:10:47] tronbadgames: @Towelliee are the UI elements like menu screens etc, still stuck in place? or did they make them movable?
[6:11:05] QQisLIVE: Do you have Apple TVs streaming service ?
[6:11:07] ArcaneMaki: So I guess Druid flying form won't be at all supported in DragonFlight continent? @Towelliee
[6:11:07] ArcaneSyntax: I don't even think I finished last season
[6:11:46] valianya: They'll open up regular flying in df eventually
[6:11:48] Hydro1904: Druids are not dragons so no
[6:11:58] Hydro1904: They can fly but not dragon flight form

[6:22:33] trivotix: wow is a perfect. It allows you to be an introvert solo gamer. You make a friend that you feel comfortable with and then another and the you have a group. It is great for those who have social anxiety issues. I have seen so many people make progress. Great to see
[6:22:41] xmedpakx: good morning folks
[6:22:49] realfatness: how do you like brewmaster on alpha so far?
[6:22:51] NieIas: its still gonna take 2 weeks to level to 70 with 50% exp buff
[6:22:59] NieIas: maybe 1.5 with alot of streams
[6:23:01] trivotix: ^^^
[6:23:06] yardmmada: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:23:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: The fresh servers are going live in 4 days, we need the list to plan
[6:23:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Classic andies LUL
[6:24:02] HaxzorJimDuggan: you can turn it off in the inn if you want to not have it
[6:24:03] notColt45: those ppl are so delusional
[6:24:10] ArcaneSyntax: leveling still takes a long time, even with the boost
[6:24:10] Dankind64: Candies are insane!
[6:24:20] Scoodles91: they can only kil lboars to level if they want.. :D
[6:24:26] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee it's like leveling in wrath with heirlooms
[6:24:33] Cloud1k: im lvling right now in classic and 50 percent feels amazing
[6:24:36] QQisLIVE: It's so hard to get away from those people too. Idk how many guilds I landed in and had those types.
[6:24:39] tronbadgames: bro if you get 75xp instead of 50xp thats way way too much! lol
[6:24:40] xmedpakx: do pet battles give xp?
[6:24:42] NieIas: leave that to hazelnutty
[6:24:46] trivotix: How many people did the grind back in the day. It isn't new content. Who cares... Enjoy the gift and don't bitch
[6:24:53] TheFox0228: honestly, people are in too much of a hurry to get to end game content. When they rush there they complain in a couple weeks of "nothing to do" KEKW
[6:24:58] notColt45: iTs A cHaNgE rEeEeE
[6:25:09] BigHeroSixy: I prefer the 50% for wrath for sure. The game changed a lot from vanilla to wrath and I remember back during wrath I just raid logged lmao.
[6:25:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: they just gonna go spam dungeons anyway
[6:25:17] abracka_: i was just talking to someone in TBC about a collect quest, and this guy goes "don't compare these 2004 quests with smartphone dumb dumb. the world went from working hard and feeling rewarded to instant gratification and not feeling good"
[6:25:18] abracka_: i just replied, "ok boomer"
[6:25:44] Jokervenom1978: towStop towIt
[6:25:44] QQisLIVE: Somehow if I boost, I ruin their experience.. lul
[6:25:58] notColt45: Next ppl will complain fresh isn't during actual Wotlk
[6:26:01] SpyCrabbo: @abracka_ LUL
[6:26:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: they wont be complaining after they start getting killed in capital cities by the zombies, i may or may not be logging on to spread that shit Kappa
[6:26:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: That does sound wonky, if you're missing out on rep
[6:26:59] abracka_: @HaxzorJimDuggan i'm calling the CDC right now
[6:27:09] trivotix: @QQisLIVE sooo true. But it is ok to buy gold and get mage boosted...
[6:27:10] theoriginalzinng: yeah i think they need to adjust main story quest values or something so you dont run out of main story to do before max level
[6:27:14] yardmmada: That or make some of em repeatable
[6:27:16] theoriginalzinng: or add more quests
[6:27:17] TheFox0228: Hmm, that's odd. Sounds like one of those bad "decisions" blizz makes players chose from lol
[6:27:34] tronbadgames: sounds like an oversight. they thought "lets give rep for reward when no xp is avail" and didnt think of it from player perspective
[6:27:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: a full set of pvp gear is pretty easy to get
[6:27:39] ArcaneSyntax: the prepatch event has some catch up gear @Towelliee
[6:28:23] BigHeroSixy: Yeah my first run through was awful lmao
[6:28:42] yardmmada: Personally think leveling should take a long time but I know that's unpopular
[6:28:48] stresstest: is it that bad to have to do side activities thru the main story to get max level ?
[6:28:50] abracka_: they should split the quests up so they're gated by level if that's the case
[6:28:52] NieIas: you could finish it off by doing dungeons
[6:28:53] JasperCalico: Surely boxCopium
[6:28:53] BigHeroSixy: My second run after pathing i nthe side quests I did at the end it wasnt that bad but not everyone does side quests.
[6:29:01] the_cube: Bring in the New World grind :D
[6:29:02] Vile_: KEKW
[6:29:08] valianya: That's stupid, that Can't be intended?  That incentivises skipping quests that you encounter while leveling and why skip if you're going through it on main
[6:29:36] BigHeroSixy: I got my second run down to 6 hours and 5 minutes but the amount of side quests I did was a bit much
[6:29:38] TheFox0228: Really i think leveling should take longer, the problem is WoW has become a game that most of the content is at max level while leveling is kinda barren of activities to do with people
[6:30:49] PastelByeol: uni1 uni1 uni1 uni1 uni1
[6:30:51] yardmmada: In my perfect world it takes 20-30 on your main and then once max on 1 character then you get an account wide buff for the rest of your toons
[6:31:01] yardmmada: what do people think about that?
[6:31:17] bigcountry555: bigcountry555 gifted a Tier 1 sub to bigdaddystunna! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[6:31:22] Effin_Steffin: @yardmmada Seems Legit.
[6:31:26] Dankind64: treasure plucking in WoD was so good
[6:31:32] solor3544: Don't listen to the complainers.....your streams have been great
[6:31:33] BigHeroSixy: Yeah Legion leveling I wasnt in beta for that I think I was max the second day pretty comfortably?
[6:31:38] tavon1998: WoD lvling was nice
[6:31:44] TheFox0228: @yardmmada pretty good idea tbh. Blizzard is starting to get into more alt friendliness too so it's not like it's impossible
[6:31:51] ChefRandell: does dragonflight seem further along than shadowlands was in the testing phase with 3 months untill release left?
[6:32:12] CCG_337: i liked so much WoD leveling for sure
[6:32:14] savioccs: I enjoyed Legion
[6:32:22] strike879: i wouldnt mind needing time to level on main so 15+ hours on main fine but not on alts
[6:32:27] BigHeroSixy: I liked high mountain and stormheim the first time through a lot. I dont remember how I felt about WoD leveling.
[6:32:37] NieIas: super secret btw
[6:33:02] TheFox0228: WoD felt like an immersive story because of the epic cutscenes. I enjoyed it despite how short WoD's full content was in the end.
[6:33:19] TheFox0228: ^ while leveling
[6:33:38] NieIas: you need more exp from 59 to 60 than 60-61, seems a bit weird

[6:37:56] happybooger: i could see pallies or priest getting it
[6:37:57] TheFox0228: i was kinda hoping monks might get a brez, give them more appeal since MW isn't too popular right now
[6:38:02] strike879: might mean towelliee gets to raid again instead of towellieesan
[6:38:03] the_cube: They are just gunna call it Devine Intervention and bring it back as a brez lol

[7:03:05] spookychefkarolina: @91niki I believe it’s a CBD provider thing

[7:03:26] spookychefkarolina: It’s not a surprise, CBD has gone up in price substantially in recent times
[7:03:48] 91Niki: Yeah I'm sure they will find something else. There is soooooo many CBD providers out there. Obviously not all equally good quality. But I am sure they will find one

[7:04:56] DallTV_: could realy use cbd to fall a sleep after my long work hours
[7:04:56] raldrik: so DF = RIP bagspace. I wish they would give us another bag slot beyond then reagent one. Or make the reagent one be unlimited space
[7:05:14] 91Niki: Yeah I like using hydration products after working out. Or after a long hike. If it's warm out, you can't possibly keep up with hydration while hiking, even if you try to drink a lot. So hydration products are amazing :D
[7:05:15] skymercii: wait what about Destiny 2
[7:05:18] WolfofWarSong: they probably use cbd isolate which is insanely good almost no taste and works really well but its like $10-15 per gram
[7:05:19] SauceFu: I wish ADV had the option to pick and choose some of the sample packs of flavours your interested in so you didn't have to buy a whole tub to try a new flavour
[7:05:41] skymercii: im on destiny while lurking

[7:06:34] mozavich: i got the blueberry acai
[7:06:36] WolfofWarSong: yeah they seem better
[7:06:38] 91Niki: @DallDK CBD is legal in Denmark. As long as there is either no THC in, or it's below 0.2%.

[7:20:14] JasperCalico: 1 pvp realm that... is... interesting LUL
[7:20:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: i get they dont want to have too many servers but yeah 1 of each would have been a smarter option
[7:20:24] Daveybutter: are fresh servers up!? or is that on the 30th?
[7:20:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard's worst decision of the month, not having more fresh servers (and not having PvE servers)
[7:20:43] StoneFaceWoW: dude i'm so fuckin bummed out man just this ruined my week
[7:20:56] StoneFaceWoW: i just wanna vibe out

[7:21:39] Kneckt: dumb asf
[7:21:41] KronasKG: tHATS TERRIBLE

[7:22:07] Mecabeast: maybe statistics say people don't want to play pve servers for classic?
[7:22:13] CCcaps92: @Towelliee The question is: can you ONCE AGAIN transfer your lvl 70 to that server???
[7:22:13] swags67: I wanted fresh pve
[7:22:20] huhwhyinbred: wrath will only have 1 server?
[7:22:23] SSD511_: You will destroy those kids as a prot
[7:22:29] KronasKG: I already was bummed about no LFD and now I am done.... dont wanna get ganked over and over again
[7:22:30] LeXieSterling: Maybe they regret launching classic all together
[7:22:31] the_bad_goat: Guess I should stop leveling up my bc classic to prepare for wrath. Need to focus on retail anyway
[7:22:33] CCcaps92: great phew
[7:22:36] ProfessorChaoos: Its gotta be wrong tho, no way they dont do 1 pve 1 pvp lol
[7:22:38] iamlrde: If they have a pvp server it will end up having 100 active people playing it, kinda a waste to put resources to people who will only play for a 2 months
[7:22:41] Alienfromger: perhaps they have a spreadsheet that classic players are all pvp
[7:22:42] iamlrde: pve
[7:22:44] DreamSweet: Wow
[7:22:44] Ludicruz: blizz hasn´t listened to the community for years..  :D
