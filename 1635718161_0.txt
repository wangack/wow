[0:59:00] Narmus_: My main monk is in a bad state :'D..... At least Brew is decent. I think. Wanna tank this expansion.
[0:59:09] 91Niki: I really don't think they would delay the game over that. It's a system they can disable until fixed
[0:59:20] Kavieonn: Anyone elses game been stuttering ever since DF prepatch?

[1:01:27] Fleymour: it was a sl legendary.. no one used it
[1:01:33] 91Niki: @Velashen It's a "big" deal for raiders. But blizzard won't delay the game based on something that's gonna make raiders potentially less powerful for the first week of raid, and that's IF they can't fix it before raid.
[1:01:57] Bruizedfish: tru
[1:01:58] Ziddrax: oof
[1:02:05] 3663Sharad: Sadge but true

[2:15:08] rosina_scarlett: @Thdlock I think so as well
[2:15:11] Collected1: SilverAlix : not until the next phase
[2:15:13] gidgeet: @SilverAlix YES Thank you
[2:15:16] BogdanCaba: @Towelliee Dragonriding alone cuts off 2-3 hours from casual leveling
[2:15:17] Thdlock: yes
[2:15:18] ic3k0ld: why level so fast just to hurry up and wait, or still have to go back and do things you missed
[2:15:18] ZeroNpcTV: im liking arcane mage
[2:15:19] Hyrja: sweaty min max nerds
[2:15:19] Rottencoarse: @gidgeet  you can skip shadowlands leveling on the 15th of November

[2:15:35] im_capy: warmode is a big part
[2:15:37] SilverAlix: @gidgeet oh sorry not till next phase
[2:15:47] CaptainAlkohol: no, you can level in 3 hours with campaign and sidequests. it takes a lot of practice and consumable shenanigans @Towelliee
[2:16:02] BogdanCaba: warmode and getting ahead early
[2:16:17] Thdlock: u just have to do the main campaign realisticlaly

[2:16:44] Collected1: good for alts i guess
[2:16:44] im_capy: everyone being able to tag same mob will help
[2:16:52] BogdanCaba: my largest concern with leveling is the first zone, it might be unplayable because of the lag, especially Kazzak or Tarren Mill Eu
[2:16:52] JustSeren1ty: @Towelliee Im a new Tank in WOW (tanked in ff 14 savage tho). How is bear in Dragonflight and does it suit a beginner?
[2:16:56] Thdlock: yes
[2:17:04] Thdlock: the problem is cant rush only campaign
[2:17:06] Thdlock: or u will be underleveled
[2:17:08] Rottencoarse: Rottencoarse gifted a Tier 1 sub to Thdlock! They have given 179 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:17:17] SilverAlix: First time through i do every quest
[2:17:20] DUCK__FOOT: @JustSeren1ty its the easiest
[2:17:21] Thdlock: ye there are plenty of reallyt effiecient side quests
[2:17:27] abracka_: @JustSeren1ty bear or brewmaster is a good starting tank to learn the ways
[2:17:32] Ertra: is it better to do the side quests after you complete the main quest tho?   higher level, higher rewards?
[2:17:37] Thdlock: idk i dont care much bout leveling so i just go fast and do some yolo sidequests and get done in 4 hrs or smth
[2:17:40] the_gody: @JustSeren1ty if you tanked savage in ff14 you are not a beginner, choose whatever
[2:17:47] BogdanCaba: @JustSeren1ty Do not start with Bear because it has development issues and talent build issues right now, it might take until 10.1 to fix. Start off with warrior or paladin

[2:17:51] Lostdogal: I have a dozen alt characters at 50 waiting to level because I just can't face more shadowlands leveling lol. Hope there is a way to skip it when DF launches
[2:17:54] NaBNez: true the side quests are needed for exp, im not sure if running each dungeon while leveling will give enuff exp to skip the side quests
[2:18:08] justagamingfiend: as long as i don't need to repeat an intro quest for 20 alts I'll be fine
[2:18:09] nilachip: I like questing and levelling so I would finish every zone
[2:18:13] atsq1: Is prot paladin hard to play for. Newb?
[2:18:15] ZeroNpcTV: anyone play rogue? what;s the best spec right now
[2:18:18] rosina_scarlett: @Lostdogal you can talk to chromie and choose where to lvl 50-60 apperently
[2:18:28] Thdlock: ye i mean the normal dungeons are increidlby easy
[2:18:32] Thdlock: u can almost solo them with mythic gear lol
[2:18:35] NaBNez: makes sense
[2:18:38] JustSeren1ty: hmm ok thx chat
[2:18:52] JustSeren1ty: reconsidering my bear choice then ^^

[2:19:04] Crafty_plays: Does anyone know if chromie time is active 50-60 right now?
[2:19:09] im_capy: warmode in beta and warmode in live will be a diff story imo

[2:52:21] its_milk_: kek
[2:52:23] reggiepowa: @its_milk_ some type of resources, similar to war resources in bfa
[2:52:26] TheAverageGoob: Alliance would rather watch their faction die than toggle pvp lol
[2:52:28] ZeroNpcTV: 20?
[2:52:29] DunlapRP: pfft i'm alliance alway splay with war mode an di kill all the horde cuz they're bad
[2:52:30] raye_gaming22: who uses warmode in the first place ?
[2:52:35] DeanoTV: @its_milk_ nothing, no anima shit
[2:52:37] MarquisLek: just war mode it up
[2:52:39] 03nightmare27: 10
[2:52:42] The_U1timatum: A52 they def play war mode when leveling in SL
[2:52:43] Featherbow: I think he's concerned about having to fight the alliance slowing him down
[2:52:45] altair19992: i think its 20 for alli
[2:52:47] cynical_effect12: 15/20% for ally
[2:52:48] Revoca: 10 for horde 20 for alliance
[2:52:49] Bogzeh: or just be a mage
[2:52:49] Velanthos: WM is 10
[2:52:50] Thoreya: @chizu_gaming SL destroyed warmode, but it was good in BFA
[2:52:53] Dionaut: I just dont find it worth it. Yea the 10% is nice, but just having to deal with pvp dying and running back. Pass.
[2:52:53] cynical_effect12: not sure what is for horde
[2:52:55] Mecabeast: 10-50 pending faction imbalance I think
[2:52:56] MarquisLek: FUR DUR WHORED!
[2:53:04] KaisenSiru: @chizu_gaming WM is good when farming rares due to that reason LUL
[2:53:04] dwolters_the_zombieman: I see people with warmode on
[2:53:04] noosphear: 10% for Horde on most servers.  Depends on the server population.

[5:02:15] FruckAwesome: all about reporting numbers
[5:02:18] HostileGamers: true,  better to have someone commit to leveling to 70 on it and end of playing it longer
[5:02:18] xo_navi: Probably a lot of in house testing for the zone too. The goblin one was kinda complex.
[5:02:20] FruckAwesome: to shareholders

[5:03:58] CrunkyBrewster: thats your maestrom
[5:03:58] Aro725: maelstrom
[5:04:00] pereadin: @loragheta there's a high skill disclaimer before playing one for a reason.  There's very few players I've come across during beta testing that can play the class properly.  And by very few I mean maybe 1 in every 100 players will play it correctly.
[5:04:02] pedrobosseljon: Thats you main spender
[5:04:03] xo_navi: oo
[5:04:09] Riykeross: white means u overcapped maelstrom weapon

[5:06:30] deliora7: for more dmg
[5:06:31] CodyKane: 10 i cap, so you want to use them up
[5:06:31] loragheta: @pereadin a good majority of their talents rely on procs. the rotation is easy enough, mind numbingly.
[5:06:32] Cannonbaul: that UI sucks for maelstrom

[5:08:04] Justintegra31: if you untalent it, it should go away
[5:08:05] deliora7: u dont use lava burst as enhance
[5:08:06] loragheta: people take lava burst if you get elemental blast so you get 2 charges of it
[5:08:08] NovaNax: its procing cause its part of maelstrom now
[5:08:08] deliora7: anyways
[5:08:09] themytee: if you take elemental blast in the enhance tree, taking lava burst will you give you a second charge of elemental blast
[5:08:30] MenagerieGaming: @sliproach do you use elvui? They are all there in spellbook but when i put on my bar it will not open.
[5:08:31] xo_navi: the default ui shows it pretty well
[5:08:33] pedrobosseljon: @Towelliee you dont need notifications, you use them at 5+ stacks of maelstrom weapon
[5:08:34] rensdeamo: Roberto - love hearing your comments - you know .. But like you know all the time is - Meh
[5:08:37] Cower311: luxthos prolly has so many weak auras to fix lol
[5:08:38] Riykeross: u dont really need it,the maelsorm bar tells u
[5:08:39] 00birdhouse: you can change the order of the icons by moving them in the w a
[5:08:40] NovaNax: @deliora7 you do use it if you use the talent that changes it to elemental blast
[5:08:47] Cower311: poor mans doing gods work
[5:08:47] Justintegra31: does CONSTANTLY strafing back and forth increase your dps?
[5:08:50] JeffreyVegas: I found with the new Luxthos WA you need to move the spells around a bit to see the ones proc u want.
[5:08:58] BlewGamingGroup: thats what the maelstrom bar is for .. when its full .. hit it
[5:09:01] grimji92: why not its stuck in my head
[5:09:06] 91Niki: @rensdeamo ?
[5:09:09] Cower311: default UI isnt as good as it was hyped up to be
[5:09:23] Cower311: doesnt have the custimization options that elvui or other addons have
[5:09:24] pk99: lux needs to make more money for all that effort
[5:09:29] pedrobosseljon: @Towelliee yeah but your soenders just use malestrom weapon stacks. they dont have a cd
[5:09:29] Khyber_GT: i love new ui
[5:09:31] xo_navi: i mean maelstron is just the giant lighning bolts on your screen lol
[5:09:31] Cower311: i tried
[5:09:40] Cower311: not worth the headache changing off elvui
[5:10:08] Cower311: i wish i could love the new ui but its just not as good as elvui
[5:10:08] Justintegra31: Hit that instacast healing surge
[5:10:08] themytee: its not the proc, it glows when its insta cast because you have 5 or more maelstrom
[5:10:11] Khyber_GT: i deleted elv and setup new ui same exact way. wa's are for everything else
[5:10:19] NovaNax: I dont see anything bad with the new ui i just use Bartender with it and it fixes alot of the issues ppl had the bag space and shit i dont care for anyways im fine were they sit

[5:40:28] BullDevil: problem like you said is their damage, which means they won't be brought in RWF so no one in mythic guilds will want them because they weren't "meta" for Echo/Liquid.
