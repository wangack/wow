[0:21:12] 인터넷포트: Swifty, in a recent interview I learned that in Dragon Flight it gets even BETTER. Not only flying, but for PvP we are going to have a  vendor style system where conquest gear is the same level for all. Although u can upgrade it which will buff your PVE advantage only. For ALTS this is HUGE! You can multi class 4 classes etc. @Swifty
[0:21:19] MattAchuxD: Speaking of tournaments there is a rbg one comming next week
[0:21:20] sonartwitchtv: so its, Microsoft, activision and the Blizzard

[0:22:27] 인터넷포트: no
[0:22:30] 인터넷포트: there is 8 tiers
[0:22:35] DovahChicken: i think he mean there is no PVP item level  all have same item level
[0:22:39] MattAchuxD: no pvp ilvl and the upgrade will only be for pve
[0:22:42] slumbilly808: everyone gonna have max pvp from start i think
