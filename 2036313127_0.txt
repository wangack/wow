[0:28:56] bsanbei: Okay i just dont wanna pour my time into making it to 70 and it be bad. Thanks
[0:28:57] ItsJhelo: 2.5k xp Rsham, but dps can be so frustrating
[0:28:59] rivellana: fishing in the gilneas canals
[0:29:11] stalecheetos: it does not take that many casts really. very doable during queues
[0:29:24] rekt1370: aug nerfed in theground
[0:29:25] rivellana: took me like 150 casts, it varies quite a bit

[0:31:05] Stoichulk: Would need to take Prescience with the 4 set
[0:31:23] Stoichulk: 4 Set work with an ability you dont have
[0:31:44] Stoichulk: Sounds good?
[0:32:08] ALLtheEXP: @ItsJhelo So, I feel you there, I'm not the best, in fact sometime I'm straight throwing. But alot of times I'm seeing my games become a 3-3 or 2-4 because my other dps dies and I feel like outside of dark and just peeling via max dam I can't do alot for them
[0:32:34] Stoichulk: 3s would make the extra crit for the other members good tho right?
[0:32:34] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!

[0:35:38] DayWalkerTV: @ALLtheEXP 100% get it. if you arent satisfied they give full refunds
[0:35:40] happyheals: make a fresh worgen
[0:35:40] dakotan517: i did it as horde idk if it makes difference
[0:35:49] ALLtheEXP: I know it's been around forever
[0:35:54] dooshken: @DayWalkerTV yea zero game knowledge beyond pvp applications haha
[0:35:59] dakotan517: we went from by sfk
[0:36:02] ItsBees: It's south of Undercity
[0:36:33] jointhescene: what item are you after?
[0:36:37] Stoichulk: I was upset for a second that your werent soaring :P
[0:36:40] ALLtheEXP: @DayWalkerTV Fair enough. I know between us we'd certainly consume enough content to make it worthwhile. I like watching some of their youtube videos
[0:36:51] ArdellanDH: Yo yo
[0:37:09] What_ln_Tarnation: now they just have to solve the dragon mog problem
[0:37:24] dooshken: now they need to add wings to the model for DHs so they can fly too like they should be able to
[0:37:43] ItsBees: Dh doesn't need more stuff
[0:37:49] dooshken: Illidan flies with his wings smh
[0:37:52] What_ln_Tarnation: D:
[0:37:53] ALLtheEXP: it needs more invincibility
[0:37:56] ALLtheEXP: pls
[0:38:07] skooovs: DH for sure should be able to fly B)
[0:38:15] reedthesham: I hope they add more customizations for other classes like they did with druids and lock pets.... shaman skins for wolf
[0:38:20] ItsBees: in water
[0:38:21] ItsBees: Kappa
[0:38:23] zymweth: Why not druid
[0:38:29] Stoichulk: Canals?
[0:38:36] ALLtheEXP: What are you fishing for?
[0:38:42] Juliio29: morning Ven and friends!
[0:38:49] ALLtheEXP: inSANE fish
[0:38:54] GiiGa07: Do u did the quest ?
[0:39:05] Stoichulk: First cast! LETS GO
[0:39:09] dooshken: your skill is 0 so you're prolly gonna get crap grey items for a while
[0:39:36] Stoichulk: Just need the spectacles
[0:39:37] dooshken: lul
[0:39:50] happyheals: it is the replacement for fish getting off the hook
[0:39:52] leeka: it took me around 30 mins
[0:40:01] ItsBees: just says the waters of Gilnaes
[0:40:14] realdreadx: what is that title
[0:40:16] sogorim82: WHATS going on?
[0:40:21] leeka: i did it just south of you
[0:40:22] ALLtheEXP: @sogorim82 he's fishing
[0:40:28] ItsBees: I haven't gotten it yet, doing the Outland cup :D
[0:40:31] sogorim82: whats all that fishing for?
[0:40:39] dakotan517: DID IT
[0:40:45] dakotan517: yes
[0:41:09] happyheals: you would be a sight to behold
[0:41:11] arty_noone: got goggles in 30 attempts with 0 fishing skill
[0:41:13] Stoichulk: They do seem cool
[0:41:14] ItsBees: tnmog
[0:41:16] happyheals: a spectacle
[0:41:20] Stoichulk: Mog love!
[0:41:35] alexandirovic: @venruki hey bro hows it going? which healer do you think is best in retail pvp atm? im thinking of resubbing :D
[0:41:35] happyheals: got a raft?
[0:41:43] happyheals: fun to fish on them
[0:42:05] Crocfacex: DRUIDS did get nurfwed
[0:42:09] What_ln_Tarnation: so they wont get nerfed then
[0:42:14] Crocfacex: not enough?
[0:42:23] scarydreamsz: hpriest>?
[0:42:25] arty_noone: i think ye, but i learned df fishing, idk how it works (i mean we need base fishing or df)
[0:42:36] alexandirovic: @venruki shuffle mainly and 3s with buddies, got a dru and pri
[0:42:37] dromare: but once they nerf druid once everyone go play hpal? it is right behind rdruid
[0:42:43] ALLtheEXP: AGREE
[0:42:46] TootinFresh: AWC soon, hype
[0:42:47] ALLtheEXP: WTF why is it a thing
[0:42:57] Stoichulk: Self what?
[0:42:59] happyheals: After not being in the mix for a long time druids are good for part of a season. Prob gonna destroy them again somehow
[0:43:13] rekt1370: shams insta lose to dh dk getting ran down
[0:43:15] rekt1370: damage is too high
[0:43:19] Gotheels: rdruids always go from good to unplayable. never in between
[0:43:20] dromare: shams only good at healing like TSG or DK WW though
[0:43:21] Xeliumimar: whens the hpriest challenge, you can truly be miserable
[0:43:36] dromare: hpal and rdru can heal alot more comps making them better for LFG
[0:43:40] rekt1370: cant run down a druid
[0:43:41] Syerinnz: i hope the micro CCss go away
[0:43:43] mikkinorum: I mean... do anything survive that combo?
[0:43:43] iloveyalunn: everyone will just complain about paladin/shaman next
[0:44:04] hotshotlester: Yo Ven! Finally found out my son is going to be getting hearing aids after over a year of appointments and advocating that he needs them. 'Tis a good day!
[0:44:05] TootinFresh: I want to see some unconventional AWC teams. Give me double aff lock
[0:44:07] rekt1370: awc goin to be brutal the balance is so wack its going to be rogue/caster mirrors
[0:44:11] RedeemedbyJesus: Do lower played dps like surv hunters etc. get quicker dps queue times than say DHs that are everywhere?
[0:44:46] RedeemedbyJesus: @hotshotlester Congrats man! You could take a video of his first time hearing something with them on
[0:44:46] ALLtheEXP: @hotshotlester I'm so excited for your baby boy!
[0:44:52] happyheals: druids are supposed to be powerful in later seasons with the higher mastery. People should leave them be so they don't get nerfed so bad that they suck again for a whole expac
[0:45:02] rekt1370: so hard to kill druids too compared to holy pally or shaman
[0:45:19] hotshotlester: Yeah. test after test after test. doctors saying moderate hearing loss doesn't qualify the need. i think it's that combined with the fact that he's almost 2 and has no words yet
[0:45:30] RedeemedbyJesus: Do lower played dps like surv hunters etc. get quicker dps queue times than say DHs that are everywhere?
[0:45:44] rekt1370: @RedeemedbyJesus  no
[0:45:54] ALLtheEXP: @hotshotlester What exciting news for you and your family. Wishing you the best.
[0:45:56] TootinFresh: Ven, thoughts on posts suggesting MS be removed or being conscious decision
[0:45:58] SteLawBro: Meanwhile you have everyone else playing at regular rating wanting healers to be omega buffed because damage is too high and people die too fast. Good luck Blizzard lol.
[0:45:59] fungames: is convoke damage Druid better than healing Druid for frost+rDruid 2s?
[0:46:07] fungames: convoke resto I mean
[0:46:26] fungames: frost mage I mean
[0:46:26] Sosatko: I dont think bm / demo should have it tbh
[0:46:31] shugguls: warrior killed him
[0:46:33] dickman911: @RedeemedbyJesus this is an interesting question, my personal experience is that there are definitely times i get an inexplicable short queue on DPS but i think its rating related and not spec related (just speculating)
[0:46:34] Sosatko: a pet that puts up constant MS is so broken lol
[0:46:40] Viuffx: i think they should redesign some of the mortal strikes
[0:46:44] Xeliumimar: i think were gona see some assas rogues in awc that spec is flying under the radar
[0:46:50] TootinFresh: Old mechanic, dated, dampening already exists, some classes are brain dead up constantly
[0:46:53] ALLtheEXP: I don't think there should be so many classes with MS
[0:46:54] ALLtheEXP: personally
[0:46:55] rekt1370: assa just the worst version of sub and outlaw
[0:47:12] Viuffx: passive mortal strikes baked into rotations that have 100% uptime are far too common imo
[0:47:28] dickman911: @rekt1370 assa seems better than outlaw to me from what i have seen
[0:47:38] rekt1370: @dickman911  nah outlaw cant die assa can
[0:47:53] arty_noone: i got on coast wich on left side of your minemap (but got df fishing, idk does it affect)
[0:47:56] dickman911: fair point
[0:47:58] rekt1370: as pure damage assa prob does more than outlaw but outlaw has cdr and cant die
[0:48:18] ItsBees: just fish
[0:48:24] mikkinorum: I fell like there are basically no diff in dmg between MS classes and non-MS classes, which annoys me a bit haha
[0:48:31] Tpyoeror: good morning ery'body
[0:48:32] supatease: full head of hair i'd say is a good roll of the dice

[0:54:20] HorYzoN29: @venruki was cata mage good in arena?
[0:54:28] rekt1370: no one ever went vs aug and had a good time
[0:54:38] rekt1370: mage has never been bad in arena
[0:54:40] Juliio29: they should go you, you deserve to get beat up for quein Aug haha

[1:57:12] ALLtheEXP: @venruki I didn't call him back.  Once I started therapy some stuff came up that caused me to take a step back from that 'relationship' until I work through some difficulties. The guilt stems from imagining him seeing my name appear on his phone and what that must have sparked in him
[1:57:19] ItsJhelo: SOS 11k casts into trying for the  sea turtle mount
[1:57:44] leeka: double rogue in 2s is fun
[1:57:45] What_ln_Tarnation: problem with 2s is rogues
[1:57:53] nikthevoker: and no rewards
[1:57:54] happyheals: when you get the double rogue team
[1:58:02] Xeliumimar: oh i love fighting FW/Melee playing caster/healer in 2s love love love it
[1:58:09] Acurarx: my parents tried to act “disappointed” because I was gay, and I told them it’s cute that you think your disappointment holds ANY weight with me given what both of you have done to me and my sister. but that’s your problem, not mine. my folks know not to try it with me.
[1:58:12] happyheals: that attacks and goes back stealth until they dampen kill you
[1:58:14] ZhangTuShi: my highest rating in 2s is as ele sham bm hunter because we just kite them to damp and win
[1:58:21] ferahgok: 2s is fun but double dps can't compete anymore, rewards are slower to acquire, and some classes stand out quite further than others
[1:58:23] ALLtheEXP: @venruki  Nope.
[1:58:46] ZhangTuShi: i guess this is vent trauma with vent day LUL
[1:58:46] xqooq: XD
[1:58:56] ALLtheEXP: VENTruki
[1:58:57] Justinky1: i recommend not running the dragon into the ground or any objects :)
[1:59:05] zarakiirl: use the yellow dragon is smaller
[1:59:31] happyheals: happyheals gifted a Tier 1 sub to Acurarx! They have given 10 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:59:33] suclarberg: what can you spend the tokens on?
[2:00:09] Acurarx: oh wow thank you @happyheals
[2:00:21] happyheals: Yaas
[2:00:55] Drpzor: 63251 is above 1201 cr, it's not the entire sample
[2:00:58] Drpzor: etc etc.
[2:02:42] happyheals: 4 players a game in 2s and 6 in 3s and 6 in solo
[2:02:45] Xeliumimar: Is it harder, or is no one playing.. LOL
[2:02:54] pazta9: yea harder is not the word
[2:02:59] ZhangTuShi: @Xeliumimar more people are playing more 2s than 3s
[2:03:00] Drpzor: yeah, the wording is kinda clumsy on that one, needs to have a lot of stuff to keep in mind
[2:03:06] Justinky1: 'exclusive'
[2:03:12] JustTaki: agreed i think its easier
[2:03:14] ItsJhelo: 3s is def way harder, not even just gameplay, but finding folks to play with
[2:03:31] engzyng: damn boyz we hidden glads all of a sudden :D
[2:03:34] happyheals: if you think it is harder before you try then you already set a barrier for yourself
[2:03:39] itz_killjoy: im 2500 so im 99% better than everyone? LUL
[2:03:46] Acurarx: I think maybe “harder” given the numbers??
[2:04:21] ZhangTuShi: love this song
[2:04:52] varok87: i have 5 Character at 2400+ :D
[2:04:52] Moobot: Latest video "These Are The Fastest One Shots For EVERY SPEC In WoW | Venruki Reacts" view it here: youtu.be/gMhw28UG16k
[2:05:05] Nuallan94: surely more got glad in s2?
[2:05:08] Drpzor: yeah, I was more about just the disparity between the brackets, I didn't expect 2s to be thaaat far behind compared to the rest, I knew it's bad, but not this bad
[2:05:17] Nuallan94: i got my first andd only glad in s2
[2:05:26] itz_killjoy: i think more ppl played shadowlands cuz of the theme and cinematic, df is too disney
[2:05:41] Drpzor: I expected the mmr to be overall really bad, but it seems that it's kinda deflated in 3s/rss, but extremely deflated in 2s specifically.
[2:05:41] nikthevoker: @venruki im conviniced, time stop is broken in shuffle
[2:05:45] GentleKimmo: sl season 2 was my first season after wotlk and got 2100 in few weeks, it felt crazy good but next season it felt impossible :D
[2:05:52] PuffnTuff: Sad but true, Glad mount is a R1 mount basically
[2:05:52] THEURBANSPECTACLE: it should be win 1 arena game = get gladiator
[2:05:52] mvpiron: wouldn't a decrease in active players /pvp be an indicator of why people that got glad in SL aren't getting it now?
[2:05:58] ALLtheEXP: @itz_killjoy DF is awesome for a lot of reasons, but yeah, its advertisements are VERY disney
[2:06:14] michaelss_: what’s worse is people are elitest to people that didn’t play shadowlands, I’m currently 2380 with no glad title and people don’t wanna q with me and rather someone who was 2500 in slands when objectively that was easier
[2:06:50] nightmxz: #SimplifySpecs
[2:07:02] pazta9: so someone want to get good without playing alot? thats the same in every game
[2:07:05] SteLawBro: To get good at something yyou have tto....Get good at it.. 🤔
[2:07:09] pazta9: but maybe i only heard it wrong just came back
[2:07:09] shikari01: pvp evolved for the top players, not the rest.
[2:07:13] nikthevoker: noone plays aug
[2:07:21] ItsJhelo: dps ques hurt, avg 45 min que time at 2k
[2:07:25] Varaben: it’s funny when people say “#.# experienced” and it literally means nothing because it varies so much between seasons
[2:07:35] sirsw0le: no the knowledge check in this game is worlds higher than most games. that's not really a fair reduction of the post
[2:07:39] happyheals: time for paired queuing option into a 3 way 2v2v2 arena
[2:07:42] JustTaki: i feel like the first match at 0 rating has the longest queue for me
[2:07:48] Nuallan94: fifa song ratJAMA
[2:07:52] Nuallan94: ratJAM
[2:07:59] xilyx2: thats why no-build fortnite exists
[2:08:00] SteLawBro: I kind of want to be a pilot but i dont want to practice flying. Anyone know any shortcuts?
[2:08:25] ALLtheEXP: @SteLawBro my idea might get me banned from the site
[2:08:32] crawnpocktail: ow2 is pure balls
[2:08:39] crawnpocktail: miss ow :(
[2:08:43] ALLtheEXP: It's super fun
[2:08:43] mvpiron: happens in WoW PvP all the time with carries lol. rough rough
[2:08:44] crawnpocktail: 2 tanks was great
[2:08:52] nikthevoker: got my DK 4pc finally, BIG DAM
[2:09:15] QuonDot: Last 2 OW games i played, i vs'd a diamond widowmaker who could shoot a marble out the sky blindfolded
[2:09:16] happyheals: Overwatch 2 would be cool if they added a Pve style content to the game
[2:09:29] klocksmith: git gud noob
[2:09:39] crawnpocktail: @happyheals touchy subject lmao
[2:09:39] SteLawBro: Outplayed
[2:09:42] ALLtheEXP: @happyheals you mean if it was an actual sequel?
[2:09:42] happyheals: lol
[2:09:50] ALLtheEXP: lool
[2:09:52] Nuallan94: big fish small pondd
[2:09:56] Zethial: yeah some people enjoy being super sweaty and dont know how to tone it down in rec leagues
[2:10:07] Acurarx: as I’ve gotten older, I get different things from the game when I play. I’m VERY aware of my skill level in arenas, so I would just play to a certain level to get the gears and call it a day. now, it’s just sooooo much harder. granted I’m older and slower, but still.
[2:10:15] happyheals: they make it a wreck league
[2:10:24] crawnpocktail: botting is insane in OW2
[2:10:25] sTyless310: hey ven
[2:10:26] sTyless310: afternoon
[2:10:35] SteLawBro: I was in a bowling league as a kid, father son league. This one dad was like a pro bowloer and thought he was the shit. 😂
[2:10:36] goonknees: I play in a beer league going on 15 years and there will always be that type of people
[2:10:50] Choopaloop: I havent kept up with retail, can you now dragonride everywhere?
[2:10:51] Symo85: exactly. I never play above 1950 cr in any given season because it stops being fun.
[2:10:58] ALLtheEXP: @SteLawBro dunked on those dumb kids lmao
[2:11:06] SteLawBro: For real
[2:11:11] happyheals: they are sweaty in a beer league because they were drunk before the game started
[2:11:20] chipncheese: @Acurarx i think that has to do with the pvp community no longer gaining new players. its harder b/c everyone your playing has the same level of skill or knowledge you do and because of the shrinking playerbase
[2:11:39] narthiz: I cannot imagine coming into current state wow pvp as a brand new player
[2:11:41] chipncheese: @Acurarx its kind of the same thing with other pvp games that have been out for a long time, apex legends, league of legends, etc
[2:11:43] Zethial: i think battlepass system would be so good
[2:11:44] narthiz: would be damned near impossible
[2:11:44] GentleKimmo: more rewards than mount would be cool
[2:11:49] dooshken: We already pay a sub as a baseline, that's my only issue with a battlepass
[2:12:01] THEURBANSPECTACLE: @narthiz agree
[2:12:02] wackpoetic: Rated BG Blitz is the only chance for Blizzard to draw in new players to PvP
[2:12:03] crawnpocktail: @SteLawBro you know its cringe when they bring their own bowling ball
[2:12:09] Choopaloop: devils advocate, people will complain they have to do TOO much to get all the stuff
[2:12:11] ZiegeOG: wows gotta remove their sub its such a gateway to entry in this day and age
[2:12:40] ALLtheEXP: If they WERE to remove the sub and go Freemium that could change a lot about hte game and maybe not be so good
[2:12:42] SteLawBro: @KKPkMn Ball, shoes, bag, towels, shirt. Dude was the truth.
[2:12:43] thisisthotcaller: people will complain about anything though
[2:12:45] Icegt: Last expansion we were like 5 ppl playing together 2s and 3s, but we got too many R1 carrying losers, my friends quit and now I play with LFG ppl ragers or quitters
[2:12:45] happyheals: People will always complain regardless
[2:12:47] GentleKimmo: like keystone master title and mount is wayyyy easier get than r1, some little milestone stuff on the way to r1 is cool for casual players
[2:12:57] ItsJhelo: @ZiegeOG If WoW removes the sub the game will die, they wont make enough through in game purchases. They struggle as is
[2:13:08] Drpzor: tbh it would do the game so much justice if they unlocked the old elite sets behind their respective achievements and made tokens like the vicious saddle/glad, so for example if you gain glad in one season, you would get a "glad saddle" for 100 more wins, or if you get duelist, you would get an elite pvp set token for like 10 more wins which would allow you to buy one old elite set etc.
[2:13:08] ALLtheEXP: @ItsJhelo Also botters galore
[2:13:12] oaysis: yea I think maybe the pvp portion at least should be free to play
[2:13:12] wackpoetic: Seasonal rewards don't matter if the gameplay isn't fun or enjoyable
[2:13:13] kralix: just make it some u get quicker progress toawards rewards if u accompliosh different bracket goal
[2:13:19] Acurarx: I really think they need to find something to do with the THOUSANDS marks of honor we have.
[2:13:30] dooshken: @ZiegeOG how do you know?
[2:13:33] happyheals: to millions of people it is fun and enjoyable
[2:13:35] chaps_86: this season is super fun
[2:13:37] kulyowow: 21 raiders from kulyowow have joined! 
[2:13:38] ALLtheEXP: Agree
[2:13:40] pazta9: same
[2:13:42] engzyng: i like it a lot too
[2:13:44] narthiz: Weren't they working on a more permanent "garrison" at one point?
[2:13:47] pazta9: its better than its been in yeeears
[2:13:52] narthiz: that actually evolved w/the game?
[2:13:55] Drpzor: yeah agree, it's kinda more imbalanced than not, but overall it's fine
[2:13:56] stevebaron: havent played in 2 expansions and this one is fun af
[2:13:59] crawnpocktail: @SteLawBro LUL
[2:14:10] GentleKimmo: I like this gameplay too, but enjoyed shadowlands tho many people hate it
[2:14:18] heymomimonttv: istarted playing wow last year, and started on wotlk. i enjoyed it, but i switched to retail last winter and never looked back. the game is 1000x better than it used to be and the classic andy's are just looking thru their rose tinted glasses
[2:14:21] chaps_86: @Drpzor I would argue this is the most balanced patch ever.
[2:14:29] crawnpocktail: @narthiz I heard that wow beta had player housing...
[2:14:31] 3KuLTV: compare it to SL and see how much better WoW is
[2:14:37] wackpoetic: I'm still having fun, but I mean for drawing in new players the barrier of entry is still too high. I don't think adding new rewards systems moves the needle much; I think Rated BG Blitz is the avenue to draw new players into PvP without suffocating them like they would be in Arenas/Solo Shuffle/RBG's
[2:14:39] chipncheese: @Drpzor while i agree, thats a short term solution i think, you'll see an influx for a few seasons from the pve players who will cry about needing to do pvp for their xmogs then once enough people have bought boosts or played to the rating needed for it, it'll go back to dying if they dont change core fundamentals to the gameplay
[2:14:44] happyheals: I can't wait for BFA Classic
[2:14:47] remn95: wassup
[2:14:53] GentleKimmo: @heymomimonttv classic is mouth throught breathers game Kappa
[2:15:03] Drpzor: @chaps_86 25 % of the 2.4 players in 2s is rdruids specifically; now, obviously this has been the case for years, considering the rdru toolkit, but it has never been this brutal if you realise it's top 0.1 % at the same time
[2:15:09] ALLtheEXP: I have NO idea how they draw new players into WoW even less how they draw new players into pvp specifically
[2:15:20] chipncheese: @ALLtheEXP YA thats the big issue
[2:15:27] crawnpocktail: @happyheals magni coming back fer yer credit card champion
[2:15:32] WiggliTV: sitting 20 min q, was watching you and looked over and i missed the q. Sadday
[2:15:32] narthiz: @KKPkMn Imagine when AR comes to wow
[2:15:39] Drpzor: @chipncheese yeah obviously it is not an endlessly-recyclable solution, but at least it'S something, at this point in time peopel have zero reason to bother to begin with
[2:15:51] chipncheese: they are having issues drawing people into the PVE side, which the game IMO Excells at.
[2:15:52] kromg: they should make it like SL s1 where for bis weapon pve kids have to do pvp
[2:15:54] dooshken: LUL
[2:16:00] ALLtheEXP: I have a best friend that I KNOW would just fucking LOVE wow pvp but he refused to give the game a chance. He kept saying, "it feels like a 20 year old game" which is just false. I think maybe he's afraid of the stigma of "I play WoW"
[2:16:04] kromg: that was the funnest season lol and bfa had some highs also
[2:16:09] crawnpocktail: the queue times have been augmented
[2:16:09] afoscastro: im a new player but who cares for new players, it should be motivating to keep the old ones i guess
[2:16:17] chaps_86: @Drpzor I see your argument, but rdruids are not 25% better than the other healers. I think most people just gravitate to the best class even if it's a 4-5% gain.
[2:16:18] MezzioTV: they don't want u to ebon might
[2:16:20] rickjames27: dps qs are the words
[2:16:21] varok87: Q are crazy long at 2.2k mmr, only 4 Healers playing
[2:16:27] ItsJhelo: bro thats a normal DPS que
[2:16:35] rickjames27: worst*
[2:16:38] ImJordanHi: Hey Ven you ever had a shrink? Is it worth?
[2:16:43] chipncheese: @kromg Unironically, from a for fun point, BFA season 4 was so much fun b/c of how chaotic it was
[2:16:45] ZiegeOG: ill q up healer lets rage
[2:16:57] joyrex_j9: Battle Mender
[2:17:15] Justinky1: no
[2:17:16] crawnpocktail: @chipncheese KILL THE TENDIES
[2:17:19] Drpzor: @chaps_86 nah, this is a 2s case specifically, because the lack of intervention in 2s from a 3rd player makes cc specs go completely nuts, same with sub rogue; with that said though, the disparity, albeit not as significant, is in rss/3s too, and it has been opened all over again and again for the past few seasons
[2:17:20] Justinky1: he dated himself with that one
[2:17:22] wackpoetic: Like I play so many healer games at 1700 - 2000 rating in Shuffle and the toxicity makes it so I rarely play for more than the daily win to count towards vault cap
[2:17:23] heymomimonttv: @ImJordanHi therapy is definitely worth it, if you're willing to put the work in. not every therapist is a good one, not everyone will work best with you. but eventually you'll find the right doctor and itll all start to come together
[2:17:29] happyheals: yeah they shrink your self esteem
[2:17:30] sereile: shrinkruki
[2:17:43] ALLtheEXP: @havenblood I'm not sure I subscribe to the idea that it's thel ack of cool mogs/mounts/titles. a new player wouldn't know anything about those. but I DO agree that people will think, "that game is 20 years old, i'm good."
[2:17:46] Justinky1: honey, i shrunk the kids
[2:17:59] engzyng: i have been twice and it helped :)(
[2:18:00] ImJordanHi: Yeah I've never really had a need for it, and still don't but lots of successful people I know use them, as well as life coaches etc
[2:18:01] engzyng: :)
[2:18:06] Yoruus: @wackpoetic Totally agree, dps are really toxic towards healer's. Never their fault :D
[2:18:17] TheNutcracka: i think there is an additional condition for augmentation so it takes even longer than other dps
[2:18:29] realdreadx: my therapy like legit is a 10pc wing combo and a blunt of the finest herb
[2:18:33] ALLtheEXP: Speaking to an unrelated third party is key
[2:18:36] happyheals: for sure, therapy has turned a few of my friends lives around
[2:18:40] pweepysonkun: i stopped wow in wotlk and came back to DF pvp and thought it was awesome
[2:18:45] Acurarx: EVERYONE should go to therapy. even to just learn how to emotionally mature. all therapy doesn’t have to be trauma related.
[2:18:51] happyheals: I was joking about the shrinking self esteem
[2:18:52] crawnpocktail: @dreadworldx probs cheaper too
[2:18:53] ItsBees: my therapist a while back was really good at just cutting through the bs and telling me what I needed to hear and called me out on my stuff
[2:18:53] itz_killjoy: who needs a therapist when you can just ask twitch chat? LUL
[2:18:56] ItsBees: but that won't work for everyone
[2:18:59] chipncheese: true this is why i backseat streamers gameplay :)
[2:19:00] soddi: my mom said i'm bad at arena
[2:19:15] ItsBees: it slows you down
[2:19:20] crawnpocktail: thanos balls
[2:19:22] PuffnTuff: LUL
[2:19:24] happyheals: If I watch him do it then I don't have to right?
[2:19:25] moremantella255: ayo
[2:19:44] rynosaurwow: Therapists do not give advice. That's not their job. Their job is to help you understand yourself and what you feel. How to deal with certain aspects of whatever mental problem you deal with
[2:19:47] Axtin: do u have to do all the difficulties
[2:20:01] ItsBees: If you want the tmog and stuff you do :3
[2:20:03] crawnpocktail: I JUST GOT THE SPECTACLES
[2:20:07] ItsBees: or the title
[2:20:17] CinematX: if you want achieves @Axtin
[2:20:18] ALLtheEXP: Here's something I think alot of people don't want to admit. Therapy is a window in time where you get to talk about you and yourself and your problems or desires completely guilt-free. It's like an hour of selfish reflection. Not saying it's all roses and glitter, it can be really hard at times. But, having a window where you can be unabashedly selfish to only think about you is good and imperative.
[2:20:19] Drpzor: @ImJordanHi it's a kinda volatile topic; anyone can make use of a psychologist, as they *should* serve as a decent debate partner so that you don't have only yourself to argue with your "voices"; that being said, I can'T speak for other countries, but where I live shrink almost implies rather a psychiatrist than a psychologist, and these people primarily give out prescriptions not therapy, and from my experience I haven't found that too useful unless you're in a real deep pickle; looking for a p
[2:20:24] Drpzor: is generally not a bad idea
[2:20:30] chipncheese: i mean its not liek you are doing anything else anyways sitting inq ueue :)
[2:20:50] Yoruus: @venruki You don't have to push it, you can do them on several chars, and buy some stuff here, some there, right?
[2:21:10] ItsBees: Tier list Tier list Pog
[2:21:26] Drpzor: destro 4th kekw
[2:21:29] happyheals: make a tier list of the AI tier lists
[2:21:36] Synckery: assa way to low
[2:21:43] crawnpocktail: bruh convoke balance???
[2:21:46] crawnpocktail: who plays that
[2:22:03] ItsBees: Yeah boomkin is way too high and not even using the right talents LUL
[2:22:11] chaps_86: side note, took a 484k full moon from a boomy last night
[2:22:14] Synckery: top 3 are correct though, absolutely sick of anyone pretending its a caster meta when melee are pressing W to 2100
[2:22:18] wackpoetic: I wonder if it counts Choice Node talents correctly
[2:22:19] Kelminak: @Drpzor I'm a training psychiatrist. Agreed with shrink referring to psychiatry, at least in the US.
[2:22:20] chipncheese: based robot.
[2:22:28] happyheals: Prot Warrior should be higher
[2:22:49] wackpoetic: Chuckonomics farming
[2:23:08] greatshampoo: spirest a tier scuffed
[2:23:16] Drpzor: @Kelminak thanks, I wasn'T sure ^^ we have a differently "demonizing" term in our language, but that one is used for psychologists as well, so I wasn'T sure whether it's my cultural preconcepts interfering or not, english is not my native language xd
[2:23:18] happyheals: I saw him at like 6 overall in solo
[2:23:24] happyheals: might be oild data
[2:23:36] Dumblexgamer: Sub rogue as average player yes, as pro player S tier for sure
[2:23:42] wackpoetic: Interesting that Sub Rogue is A Tier despite being "the highest skill cap" spec
[2:23:44] heymomimonttv: ele as b tier and shadow at a is LOL
[2:23:48] Varaben: is it just by popularity?
[2:23:50] itz_killjoy: it was good untill sub and shadow rankings LUL
[2:23:54] Drpzor: I meant similarly* XD there it goes
[2:24:00] DoYouWannaHug: Feral at B too LUL
[2:24:03] happyheals: the AI is telling people they are playing classes wrong
[2:24:07] Justinky1: look at the sample
[2:24:07] heymomimonttv: enhance at B too KEKW
[2:24:07] wackpoetic: Varaben it looks like it's a combination of Popularity, average rating, and number of players
[2:24:17] LOVE_SOSA_666: ele should be C
[2:24:25] ALLtheEXP: I can't wait for all AI played AWC
[2:24:34] Justinky1: yeah but based on the performance of only 27 FDK players
[2:24:35] happyheals: can you see the specs they used to rank them?
[2:24:36] ALLtheEXP: I'd put stacks down on my favorite AI team
[2:24:37] Kelminak: Do they have a page explaining their math?
[2:24:39] wackpoetic: is this Solo Shuffle and 3s?
[2:24:41] happyheals: I mean talents
[2:24:42] itz_killjoy: i could see dev being s right now, its so good
[2:24:43] chipncheese: maybe AI is correct and the players just havn't figured it out smile
[2:24:49] tarth_100: we doing another tier list?
[2:24:51] Varaben: honestly playing against AI might be kinda fun like people do with chess
[2:24:51] ALLtheEXP: :kappa:
[2:25:00] heymomimonttv: aff at C tier smfh this ai is COOKED
[2:25:04] wackpoetic: Bigdam skews the numbers
[2:25:05] happyheals: Rated Comp STomp. Make it happen
[2:25:08] chaps_86: Survival pumps =D
[2:25:15] mahveenya: @venruki why affli C tier?) its very strong
[2:25:25] crawnpocktail: I mean i agree with S tier mostly
[2:25:30] Axtin: its not far off
[2:25:35] wackpoetic: It's honestly not bad for being 100% based on metrics
[2:26:07] wackpoetic: If it's combining 3s and shuffle though?
[2:26:20] NoxkneeTV: what about tanks in pvp?
[2:26:21] Varaben: they also seemed to try to spread out the specs sort of evenly which makes sense imo. If 2/3rds of the specs are A then you can spread some of the Low As into B
[2:26:23] happyheals: but were they using weird builds?
[2:26:35] praxtv: so, does anyone have any info on the reasoning behind ripping us off nature school?
[2:26:39] ImJordanHi: I think Pres could be insane though
[2:26:42] LOVE_SOSA_666: thats only a 3v3 tier ranking
[2:26:47] klikka: @venruki what are the rankings based on? most people that make tier lists just base it on their feelings. maybe this is more accurate for most of the population and not just based on some multi rank 1s feelings
[2:27:03] Ey_an: i never see aug
[2:27:10] Bigmoran: @venruki we just released a low rated tier list
[2:27:16] Axtin: @praxtv because locks are supposed to be shadowy
[2:27:27] Icegt: Compare ur achieves for arenas with the evo player to check his xp
[2:27:40] Justinky1: you can see the pathetically low samples.  some classes under 20 players.  3v3 info might not be as useful as SS
[2:27:56] flawfox: @klikka multi rank 1s don't make tier lists because of feelings, they do it based off a specs potential
[2:27:58] dooshken: @praxtv it was a holdover ability from shadowlands, warlocks have no reason to have it anymore
[2:28:14] dooshken: Like the other shadowlands holdover abilities. They were all out of place
[2:28:30] Synckery: cus afflic needed nerfing ofc Kappa
[2:28:32] wackpoetic: they are trying to retcon Shadowlands like Shadowlands retconned WoTLK
[2:28:32] happyheals: AI has secretly been learning from our raidbots sims for years and is getting ready to challenge us
[2:28:33] ALLtheEXP: @flawfox I think it's a bit disingenuous to say they don't base it off feelings. There has to be some bias in there.
[2:28:37] klikka: @flawfox and what is that potential measured by?
[2:28:41] ALLtheEXP: @happyheals bring it on bb
[2:28:55] joyrex_j9: and like most shadowlands abilities there was no consideration to the fact that the spell trees weren't just cosmetic when it came to pvp
[2:28:55] anacronz: i stack at initializing wtf is this
[2:28:58] Bigmoran: <3
[2:29:19] praxtv: @dooshken im a mage bruh
[2:29:34] ALLtheEXP: Bruh, Shadowlands systems in general were kind of like a fever dream
[2:29:37] TimeForged: remember when ads were just like 1-2 ads not 8, Pepperidge farm remembers

[2:30:09] yesterday_potato: What up!
[2:30:12] Axtin: @praxtv same reason, it was only nature to match the night fae theme but covenants arent relevant anymore so they changed it to fit the mage class
[2:30:13] dooshken: @dooshken the mage ability was from shadowlands too lol
[2:30:15] Synckery: another DH pressing W at someone and winning
[2:30:16] Synckery: love it
[2:30:17] happyheals: I think it is based on the frequency of the ads
[2:31:34] Varaben: @axtin seems like a big oversight for all of these, do you know if it affects divine toll?
[2:31:43] Varaben: as in why didn’t they fix this in 10.0
[2:31:46] happyheals: time for me to do a tank challenge
[2:32:13] What_ln_Tarnation: its never an aug lobby
[2:32:20] Essiandar: Augvoker, wow. I thought they omega killed this spec
[2:32:28] happyheals: what am I aiming for? 500?
[2:32:37] Ey_an: aug lobby = everyone else dc
[2:32:44] What_ln_Tarnation: ^^^
[2:32:45] Drpzor: aug lobby is like what, dev aug prevo? XD
[2:33:31] eMBeaR64oz: hey chat is there stuff for the new patch that you need to do for pvp? like quest stuff ? or na
[2:33:48] Synckery: rather fight an aug all day than the endless tide of DK/DH/Warriors
[2:34:12] Hark0n: is that the pumpaduki
[2:34:42] firemonkey170: @venruki thoughts on shifting power being arcane now?

[2:35:34] Synckery: I mean arcane is still super good atm in 3s
[2:35:50] Synckery: think the nerf hits afflic way harder
[2:35:52] firemonkey170: the tooltip still says nature damage lol
[2:36:39] Synckery: when ISNT it a DH lobby Kappa
[2:36:52] happyheals: DH having ms kinda overkill
[2:37:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Do anything, EZ
[2:37:14] ALLtheEXP: maybe he meant DONT do anything
[2:37:19] Justinky1: that lil shit LUL
[2:37:20] Pluckyz: do something!
[2:37:31] VetisBR: just do something ven
[2:37:33] Kelminak: I think he just means if you contribute in any way you're guaranteed to win, don't think it was meant to be negative
[2:37:51] ALLtheEXP: I thinkhe was shaming your mother and your ancestors @venruki
[2:37:54] Kimbrini: We dont speak DH

[2:39:27] Varaben: Matt and Kim catJAM I saw them live like 15 years ago they were very good
[2:39:50] happyheals: So I am supposed to go Convoke on my boomkin to be a high tier dps

[2:41:24] What_ln_Tarnation: clone: 0s cd, kick:15+s cd
[2:41:25] kusoneko: just kick the clone 4Head
[2:41:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: 192 rating tho, gg
[2:41:39] flawfox: should have kicked clone
[2:41:40] nikthevoker: some clones so bad lol
[2:41:43] yesterday_potato: it needs a cd
[2:41:44] flawfox: not sure if you know
[2:41:49] armin_ed: Imagine if clone broke on dots
[2:41:57] Craives: we were low on palumors list so buff chicken
[2:41:58] Akimbo_UK: Clone needs 15 second cd
[2:42:02] tarth_100: back to tier list!
[2:42:03] yesterday_potato: pally rep is much worse yet it has a cd
[2:42:03] Roxxybolts: glizzie
[2:42:12] happyheals: it doesn't have a cd because it can't be reapplied before it expires
[2:42:29] ezmoney3434: so are you ranking each spec for the average person skill level should play them or ranked by the full potential of each spec?
[2:42:37] Hark0n: shadow priest is S wtf
[2:42:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: That tier list doesn't look bad
[2:42:48] Dumblexgamer: i agree with AI if this is on average player, if its AWC level there are some differences @venruki
[2:42:49] yesterday_potato: arms is a solid A
[2:42:59] What_ln_Tarnation: sub only A tier KEKW
[2:43:04] Justinky1: maybe see if you can change it from 3v3 to SS
[2:43:05] stealthwalker99: does the ai account for alts of the same class I wonder
[2:43:07] Justinky1: this is too low sample
[2:43:07] happyheals: outlaw is S tier in an experienced players hands. Could be C tier in a beginners
[2:43:21] Bigmoran: @venruki rate my low rated tierlist
[2:43:21] Danval255: rogue C tier? HUHH
[2:43:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmaster should probably be on B-tier, tho
[2:43:30] kusoneko: human bias imo
[2:43:30] ezmoney3434: so are you ranking each spec for the average person skill level should play them or ranked by the full potential of each spec
[2:43:38] isseswagger: 3s? or shuffle?
[2:43:41] Bigmoran: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkkMQqAs8ZA
[2:43:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vengeance DH could probably be A-tier
[2:44:12] galdinator: oh no wonder so many people were asking, regurgitating a skill capped vid
[2:44:12] Bigmoran: BUFF SUB ROGUE
[2:44:21] happyheals: Prot warrior had the highest win rate the other day
[2:44:29] Justinky1: remove Kappa
[2:44:30] Varaben: @happyheals wtf
[2:44:33] 3KuLTV: put your tier list back on before u brbr
[2:44:38] happyheals: there were 16 games played to the thousands by other classes
[2:44:38] ellisrainy: did i miss the tier list
[2:44:47] Varaben: queue pop
[2:44:48] What_ln_Tarnation: i feel like people who main rogue get bullied IRL and need an outlet for their frustrations
[2:44:52] Varaben: here it comes
[2:44:53] Justinky1: scrap every class and start over 4Head
[2:45:26] Varaben: @justinky1 honestly that would be insane, but it’s never gonna happen. that would be like an entire expansion
[2:45:38] ferahgok: definitely for the "average" player in an "average" low rated lobby sub isn't the best. but i'm certainly not saying that should be factored into balancing. delete duel
[2:46:30] reedthesham: new game mode: azeroth going through a power surge every week and you change classes, regardless of race, that you cannot change for your one character. >.<

[3:06:47] Xeronate: rough one
[3:06:51] tarth_100: Sadly, yes. Something about Aug us just underwhelming to watch. I think Eruption spam gameplay is the off part? Hard to put my finger on it.

[3:32:00] happyheals: influencers can be a good thing. You could watch someone build a chair and you enjoyed watching them do it and it made you want to do it
[3:32:03] Chris7ka: Why's everyone been talking about MMR on Twitter? Bizz made a post?
[3:32:59] happyheals: surprised there hasn't been an influencer that does bridge jumping streams

[3:46:27] gdodmebxu: what
[3:46:31] ZhangTuShi: high skill floor *
[3:46:32] shogun2022: no its not
[3:46:37] chaps_86: 100% s tier
[3:46:40] shogun2022: hunters fucking suckj
[3:46:41] happyheals: feels good when melee is doing good as a whole
[3:46:43] chaps_86: the damage is insane
[3:46:45] nikthevoker: YUP
[3:46:45] shogun2022: oh its shuffle
[3:46:50] rekt1370: for ranged damage sure
[3:46:51] JustTaki: by a landslide
[3:46:55] MaybeRespect: Sub rogue will be bottom dmg in lobby but most impactful. Idk man
[3:46:56] rekt1370: it dies in half a second tho LUL
[3:46:59] heymomimonttv: shogun hasnt played this patch yet apparently since BM rips
[3:47:03] taylors09: @happyheals feels horrible
[3:47:04] shogun2022: when was the last time hunter won blizzcon
[3:47:07] shogun2022: hunters suck
[3:47:10] tinderx: any1 know how to fix that f eign death bug? the nameplate 1
[3:47:10] shogun2022: accept it
[3:47:25] rekt1370: dks legit make it so hunters cant play the game half the time
[3:47:26] gdodmebxu: hunters do well in tourneys
[3:47:28] Zaiyge: just because ur bad at hunter doesn’t mean hunter is bad
[3:47:28] wackpoetic: "BRO BM TOTALLY HAS MORE THAN 2 BUTTONS"
[3:47:30] shogun2022: facepalm
[3:47:30] gdodmebxu: what are you typing KEKW
[3:47:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: dev evoker whaaaat
[3:47:47] happyheals: I dislike it as a healer, but it feels good to see power shifts
[3:47:59] wackpoetic: People think Dev is squishy because they don't take the defensive PvP Talents
[3:48:08] shogun2022: im 2600 xp on hunter and they suck
[3:48:18] shogun2022: always will
[3:48:20] SteLawBro: This is so wrong already. Your average player will not live on a hunter. They will die. Very very quickly lol.
[3:48:23] Axtin: attacking a dev feels the same as attacking a prot warrior
[3:48:36] happyheals: and good players will do well
[3:48:38] shogun2022: nah its true bro
[3:48:45] slickdaddyg69: @SteLawBro true if they against me on my rogue
[3:48:46] gdodmebxu: hunter bias in chat KEKW

[3:48:59] shugguls: the all die the 2nd game onwards
[3:48:59] dropbombsss: LMAO
[3:48:59] Endoraesh: for some reason no one goes bm hunters
[3:49:01] slickdaddyg69: i always smoke noob hunters in a duel
[3:49:01] SplitViewAskew: feelings > data you know this
[3:49:04] JustTaki: if only there was proof Kappa
[3:49:05] slickdaddyg69: every game
[3:49:08] Reiumi_: ven being biased again Kappa
[3:49:10] olashma: trust the science
[3:49:11] SteLawBro: Yea cause you dont see that many hun ters cause nobody plays them.
[3:49:12] Bonegraft: 2600 rating vs 26 iq
[3:49:14] wackpoetic: SteLawBro It's also the easiest Ranged DPS spec to do damage on when not dying. That was their main point
[3:49:18] rekt1370: LUL
[3:49:18] foxyllama: this data is 100% fake
[3:49:22] foxyllama: so i agree wit the viewer
[3:49:28] Schnellmusic: skill-capped is obviously fake news
[3:49:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: mage bias LUL
[3:49:33] rekt1370: that data just tells you that locks and mages get trained more than hunters KEKW
[3:49:34] happyheals: leave Britney alone
[3:49:38] slickdaddyg69: @foxyllama foxyllama not afraid to say it as it is
[3:49:38] SteLawBro: They die the least because tthey are played the least. Makes sense.
[3:49:43] taylors09: ven gets ret pala nerfed again LUL
[3:49:50] xilyx2: HERE WE GO VEN BEING BIAS
[3:49:51] volkr16: @SteLawBro its a percentage...
[3:49:52] Xeliumimar: honestly this guy has good editing skills
[3:49:57] animeintrovibes: dont talk about my hunter i r good
[3:50:02] wackpoetic: the first thing they said was that Range DPS on average do less than melee, but BM Hunter is the only Range DPS spec that low rated players can still do damage on
[3:50:11] IamWalnuts: Mages are also much better looking
[3:50:16] rekt1370: bm is easy to do damage but hard to play no cap
[3:50:21] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[3:50:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Brewmaster pog
[3:50:24] MaybeRespect: Tell Jape that

[3:50:29] ferahgok: lol
[3:50:33] BCboy_: LULW

[3:50:45] kreyzy8: arcane sucks Kappa
[3:50:48] gdodmebxu: victim andys KEKW
[3:50:49] happyheals: insane
[3:50:51] slickdaddyg69: RAIKU LETS GOO!
[3:50:51] shogun2022: victim class lol
[3:50:51] JustTaki: the victim class haha
[3:51:08] Magottx: this guy is just hyping ven up rn
[3:51:12] Reiumi_: Sadge
[3:51:16] gdodmebxu: sp victim class rebrand Poog
[3:51:19] IamWalnuts: im going to start saying that
[3:51:28] MaybeRespect: I find it weird focusing on low MMR where people don't understand game yet.
[3:51:29] SteLawBro: W key melee classes are by far the easiest to play for beginer players. You cant convince me otherwise lol.
[3:51:29] happyheals: Spriest is a victim of nerf bullying
[3:51:41] MezzioTV: give fire all glass cannon dmg with no HP nerf
[3:51:41] heymomimonttv: if every class had a disarm, it would even the playing field between melee/ranged. every class has a kick, every class has cc, but many classes can't shut down a melee char the same way a melee char can shut down a ranged class
[3:51:42] wackpoetic: IT'S NOT A PHASE, I'M A VICTIM
[3:51:42] Varaben: ret is the professional victim class
[3:51:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shadow priest needs a 27th rework LUL
[3:51:53] yesterday_potato: sorry guys im playing a victim class not my fault
[3:52:02] ferahgok: which make up the vast majority of players btw
[3:52:04] gdodmebxu: hello, it's me the victim Kappa
[3:52:05] wackpoetic: SteLawBro they're only doing Range DPS right now lol
[3:52:07] JustTaki: which is like 75-80% of the game
[3:52:07] chaps_86: Didnt they say 50% of the population is below 1800?
[3:52:09] drewlivelyy: yeah if you dont know whats going on, big dam goes brrrrr
[3:52:11] MaybeRespect: OHH. I joined late then. Hopefully people don't take this like i did then.
[3:52:11] Varaben: @mayberespect I think the point is that the game is totally different at 1500 vs 2500
[3:52:12] xilyx2: wait where is surv?
[3:52:16] ferahgok: exactly
[3:52:19] happyheals: brewmaster
[3:52:23] drethion24: @xilyx2 sv is melee
[3:52:24] chaps_86: @xilyx2 melee list
[3:52:25] Varaben: @chaps_86 yep
[3:52:25] gdodmebxu: KEKW e tier KEKW
[3:52:28] betterbeup: @chaps_86 If you're above 1800 you're in the top 30k of all players
[3:52:40] wackpoetic: Literally everyone who is objecting in chat is not even paying attention to the video
[3:52:44] SteLawBro: @wackpoetic ooooh..Thats where im  fking up..I was gonna say, none of these are easier than waarrior or almost any melee 😂 🫣
[3:52:50] yum_nachos: awful
[3:52:51] SteLawBro: My bad
[3:52:53] kusoneko: was just gonna say that
[3:52:57] Chris7ka: My eyes
[3:52:57] berry_jams: LOW HEALTH
[3:52:58] Varaben: what is this Ui lol
[3:53:00] IamWalnuts: Chads ui
[3:53:02] ihavesmokedcrack: Better bliz plates and hide Pet HP bars!
[3:53:03] foxyllama: thats chadmanships
[3:53:04] yowler_: classic Kushclouds ui
[3:53:06] fulvoustv: lol.
[3:53:07] drewlivelyy: gotta know the health of pets in lower ranks
[3:53:10] drewlivelyy: LOL
[3:53:12] IamWalnuts: Chadmanships ui gives aids
[3:53:15] Chris7ka: Typical MM UI LUL
[3:53:16] wackpoetic: SteLawBro yes, only range right now. The reason they rank BM at the top is because they consider it the easiest Range DPS to still do damage without dying
[3:53:28] galdinator: Why aren't they showing 1600 gameplay in the background LUL
[3:53:36] yesterday_potato: boomies are victims!
[3:53:42] DiscoSlim: imagine a new player watching this
[3:53:43] DiscoSlim: wtf
[3:53:51] yesterday_potato: leave boomy alone!
[3:53:51] Varaben: @galdinator us in the rat leagues don’t publish our terrible gameplay lol
[3:53:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Boomkin is definitely not as good for lower rated players
[3:54:00] kreyzy8: @galdinator I know I feel this should be paired with the classes getting trained into the ground KEKW
[3:54:02] SteLawBro: @wackpoetic Yea maybe..Idk. I guess i can see that. Thx
[3:54:03] gdodmebxu: VICTIM CLASSES Pog
[3:54:10] vinsbarcelona: can u link the vid?
[3:54:14] gdodmebxu: i'm a victim class main
[3:54:15] MaybeRespect: Do you think blizz should balance for LOW MMR or mid tier?
[3:54:35] ihavesmokedcrack: god damn it the video just created 999 more BM hunters!
[3:54:49] Smoochii: @vinsbarcelona Skill capped latest video
[3:54:51] Locturnal_TV: ele mid tier as always
[3:55:04] xilyx2: no survival??
[3:55:10] slickdaddyg69: im 2400 and im a fire mage cuz im a good player
[3:55:12] ihavesmokedcrack: I love ele at low rating! ive been owning
[3:55:13] drewlivelyy: i just got into pvp and i get ran at as a mage
[3:55:14] Smoochii: survival is ranged?
[3:55:14] chaps_86: @xilyx2 it's melee
[3:55:14] VenoFrog: @xilyx2 is surv ranged?
[3:55:17] Alerothan: @xilyx2 Survival isnt ranged...
[3:55:17] xilyx2: i guess they consider it melee
[3:55:18] gdodmebxu: victim classes monkaTOS
[3:55:19] ferahgok: mage buffs confirmed
[3:55:24] vinsbarcelona: @Smoochii TY
[3:55:29] FoxisFitness: Ret is bad at lower and higher mmr lol atleast if you are a good mage you win blizzcon
[3:55:34] DaveTheBrave1: @xilyx2 survival is ranked as melee
[3:55:34] IamWalnuts: the only thing i disagree with in this video is their placement of Ret
[3:55:54] Axtin: buff feral
[3:55:57] dankgamer97: Feral Sadge
[3:55:58] gdodmebxu: @FoxisFitness vanguards seems to be doing okay
[3:56:07] gdodmebxu: outlaw is just hard to play
[3:56:08] Hark0n: 1600-1800 nobody knows how to outlaw lel
[3:56:09] kreyzy8: buff outlaw
[3:56:09] Bombdiggity3315: low rated rogues are the worst player sin the game
[3:56:13] matt_caste: outlaw too many procs for new player
[3:56:14] Axtin: snupyFERAL snupyFERAL snupyFERAL
[3:56:15] MaybeRespect: Rogue BIAS kekw
[3:56:15] Varaben: sub???
[3:56:15] wackpoetic: For low rated players sure
[3:56:18] b_miriani: outlaw is at least b tier lol
[3:56:18] gracioussatan: low rated players can't figure out outlaw I guess?
[3:56:20] gdodmebxu: it's definitely not low tier
[3:56:24] ferahgok: yea for average person, harder to get damage out than others
[3:56:28] kusoneko: demon GODS
[3:56:30] kreyzy8: outlaw does have a shit ton of buffs/procs to manage
[3:56:38] kreyzy8: so I can see it from that perspective
[3:56:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Big shocker with DH
[3:56:51] animeintrovibes: true
[3:56:55] kusoneko: member blade dance 100% dodge chance
[3:57:01] happyheals: just make a champion's league for players who finish at a certain rating or higher so less experienced/skilled players encounter each other more frequently
[3:57:04] chaps_86: remember the blade dance dodge mechanic?
[3:57:06] MaybeRespect: FUCK ADD NOO

[4:32:11] Axtin: good vid
[4:32:14] drewlivelyy: dev is 1 button class
[4:32:14] betterbeup: Yeah because all you have to do is dot and fear, mage has the highest skill cap of any class
[4:32:14] panjack13: Yes I am a noob and play BM hunter
[4:32:15] OttoFrank1945: I think it's fairly accurate yes
[4:32:19] NJMcChillan: i think its easier to play mage than lock personally
[4:32:24] modsbruto: Rogues are A-tier
[4:32:24] JustTaki: idk about outlaw
[4:32:25] lordofserenity: yeah except outlaw is prob bit stronger
[4:32:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Buff rogues LUL
[4:32:26] drdoomkinx: i feel like ret could be A maybe but outsdie that
[4:32:27] gladiatoratlas88: boomie should be moved up they do good dmg and can win with it alone
[4:32:28] modsbruto: Arms B-tier
[4:32:28] just_gg_s: when i dont play the game
[4:32:29] yesterday_potato: ikma be honest i would lower rogues
[4:32:38] iceskip_wow: Sub B tier is the biggest cap
[4:32:39] Deathroww: totally disagree with aff and UH placement
[4:32:40] chaps_86: Outlaw is questionable, it does have a complicated damage rotation
[4:32:41] Deathroww: esp aff
[4:32:53] yesterday_potato: rogue at low rating do almost no damage and randomly cc
[4:32:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: This does point out how lower rated players are in a different game than the high end
[4:33:17] panjack13: That price is if you buy it for a year btw
[4:33:17] FoxisFitness: Nothing easier to play against than a Ret who doesnt have Blessing of Sanctuary
[4:33:32] yesterday_potato: nerf mage
[4:33:32] just_gg_s: its best way to get into pvp using skillcap ?
[4:33:33] JustTaki: lol
[4:33:37] VetisBR: except vs warr
[4:33:38] Kymagez: 400 rating guarantee? id need a refund
[4:33:41] serratedlove: assa and outlaw are B tier at 2.1+ according to the website they used
[4:33:43] betterbeup: Mage does have the highest skill ceiling, they just die at low rating.
[4:33:46] baxter5569: mage is the only class i refuse to play
[4:33:52] JustTaki: So if you are a noob with noob friends play BM/DH/Disc?
[4:34:03] baxter5569: too many things going on and you get punished so hard for not knowing whats going on
[4:34:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: rogue and mage are tough to play well, I can see that

[4:37:32] style5z: so much bloat on mmochamp and wowhead
[4:37:58] style5z: imagine i give a shit about the hoplet pet
[4:38:15] Borngood: yo chat why is my game taking 1 year to patch
[4:38:17] Badasti: question for chat - have any of you found decent pvp guilds etc? or is the lfg gauntlet our only option for partners?
[4:38:32] rekt1370: lfg only option man
[4:38:43] Badasti: i feel like guild finder is useless, you still see guild ads from back in bfa
[4:38:45] Axtin: @Borngood close bnet updater agent in task manager and try again
[4:38:53] Borngood: @Axtin kk
[4:39:05] chaps_86: @Badasti try messaging people you think play well in shuffle
[4:39:17] Badasti: yeah guilds are dead but ads still live, I remember back in the day i had some great rbg guilds etc
[4:39:28] Badasti: @chaps_86 not a bad idea
[4:39:46] cassmann: trying out my first dps class, always played healer. getting flamed after 20min queue in shuffle for dying on destro in a war/dk/ww lobby on ruins of lordearon....
[4:39:49] chaps_86: most people would love that
[4:39:59] ItsMeChannel: @venruki i heard you talking good about dragonflight, what do you like about it? the areas, the atmosphere, dungeons, or did you mean only 3s pvp
[4:40:05] rekt1370: @cassmann  def not helping yourself picking destro for first dps LUL
[4:40:19] cassmann: i like the fantasy, got 1800 in 2's  and 3's already
[4:40:39] cassmann: green fire go brrr
[4:40:41] pazta9: df is super nice for pvp and gearing
[4:40:41] Readyforbagels: transmogs been good except for warr
[4:40:42] Mortammer: pvp gearing has been the best ever imo
[4:40:42] Badasti: @ItsMeChannel there's no borrowed power systems and its alt friendly + lots of updates
[4:40:44] pazta9: the gameplay is nice
[4:40:46] rekt1370: dont like this pvp season its ass

[4:41:05] YoMamaSoFine69: i miss that 2s is a thing idk its not fun since sl
[4:41:07] ferahgok: same tbh
[4:41:16] kashmoney31: I 100% agree with that statement. I can't stand the grind of classic

[4:41:26] kashmoney31: I like all the QOL changes
[4:41:28] brewsome34: other than the 2s bracket being completely dead, this season has felt pretty good
[4:41:33] Badasti: the only thing i hated about modern expansions was borrowed power and being funnelled into chores to pvp. Since that is gone I like retail again
[4:41:41] brewsome34: gotta beat 30 multi rank 1s to get 1800
[4:41:43] brewsome34: in 2s
[4:41:50] sTyless310: @brewsome34 true
[4:41:53] ihavesmokedcrack: theres a reason in classic theres 10million bots! every buys gold for gear advantage
[4:42:04] chaps_86: @shooklate what was different in slands that made 2s more enjoyable?

[4:42:21] pazta9: cata is fun af but will die quickly
[4:42:21] sTyless310: and less glad alts at 1600 lol
[4:42:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Gearing in Dragonflight is way easier, and that's a good thing
[4:42:29] kashmoney31: @Braeden6111 that's what people said about wotlk
[4:42:32] pazta9: what nah
[4:42:36] Devcomz: @ihavesmokedcrack Ele shaman in solo shuffle

[4:42:45] Badasti: @ihavesmokedcrack a few weeks ago, about 5 of them farming mobs in the world. I logged my mage and went to town with cleave
[4:42:50] Nachofez: you have to pray you dont get pikaboo at 1799
[4:42:53] Azzulon: and i never liked 2s as warrior
[4:43:08] betterbeup: I literally saw the most pvp bots in battlegrounds, while getting my honor gear on alts
[4:43:11] just_gg_s: what u feel for war within i have hopes for first time that will be good stuff idk why
[4:43:14] just_gg_s: not sure if im right

[4:43:52] itsmistero: it happened to my bro\
[4:43:55] heymomimonttv: he spawns behind you with a jdc red solo cup
[4:43:58] robeyres: I just hate that nothing makes me want to out an quest and see the zones, I have around 6 level 70s and I could not name the dragonflight zones, I just sit in Valdrak and queue for m+
[4:44:14] itsmistero: hes been looking for his body ever since

[4:44:41] pupitarr: but is it significant
[4:44:47] Badasti: Ven why don't you take selfies when you 1shot people
[4:44:48] brewsome34: the story and quests (especially the side quests) this expansion have been great, you just aren't forced to do it
[4:44:52] chaps_86: @thisisthotcaller lol
[4:44:55] pupitarr: the quests in the openword
[4:44:56] brewsome34: still fun!
[4:45:06] Axtin: @pupitarr are they significant in classic?
[4:45:26] Tbkingdraco: that’s the beauty though, you can solely do only what you want to do
[4:45:30] Sosatko: Bro I had a deathlog from some cringe ele last night 90-0 in 0.4 it was sickkkkk
[4:45:32] Mortammer: i mean the game is for fun, each persons fun is different. i like just flying around the zones and looking at them from the air
[4:45:37] YoMamaSoFine69: how can they make 2s fun again?
[4:45:38] ihavesmokedcrack: owned
[4:45:42] pupitarr: @Axtin personallyi think so, it feels good when you finish something. thats just my opinion though. Not hating on either game
[4:45:46] Badasti: that monk got mashed
[4:45:56] chaps_86: @shooklate what do you find unfun about 2s?

[4:46:00] ItsBees: Ven did you buy the randomization glyph?
[4:46:00] SteLawBro: Not long ago we had mandatory qorld quests and people haaaaaaaated itt. Wanted it to stop ASAP.
[4:46:10] Itankarenas: I got a bunch of gear through the zones while leveling. My problem is I find a M+ dungeon instantly, so I can't go and do the world quests for gold unless I stop doing M+
[4:46:11] Badasti: see that was a perfect selfie moment
[4:46:13] brewsome34: @shooklate ban resto druid
[4:46:15] Badasti: after the fear on FOF
[4:46:19] PunishedLrnz: in slands i was forced to and i hated it so i didnt do it

[4:51:51] foxtko: i feel like a lot of the time that happens on melee dps
[4:51:58] DoYouWannaHug: Using Serenity is a debuff to WW, it makes it so you can't use your character for 12 seconds
[4:52:03] illEvan11_11: sooo many roots, stuns, knockbacks, static field totems, ting of peace, etf
[4:52:10] illEvan11_11: etc*
[4:52:10] chaps_86: @DoYouWannaHug lol so true
[4:52:16] Dirkdigglier: I like to put vortex on my mages when they are going to knock. to do a lil trolling
[4:52:19] exercisefreak: is it just me or does arena feel rly weird after the patch? dmg feels weird and thing dont rly work like b4?
[4:52:19] Mortammer: blast wave force losing and getting a kill feels amazing
[4:52:26] Mortammer: LoS*
[4:52:29] ashidoxr: a good ele shaman or a good bot?
[4:52:32] Bourbons86: I think all of the static field type abilities should get the dk grabby hands treatment where it only sucks you back once

[4:53:10] illEvan11_11: thats why im debating going arms cuz it seems like a decently similar playstyle, with a little more CC immunity lol
[4:53:18] happyheals: I love that other classes get that Mage like control from vanilla
[4:53:31] gracioussatan: I copied your talents on warrior and played some shuffles for the first time in a week. your spec was a lot more fun than whatever I had going on
[4:53:36] Kookamonga: I almost spit out my drink the second you say beyblade
[4:53:38] cipusanx: no wonder pvp is getting less popular when you have this out of control class design
[4:53:46] chubmax: im in a 34min queue at 2k
[4:53:58] happyheals: you can do it back to back so double bae blade

[5:02:20] happyheals: for 6 seconds
[5:02:45] vortex221: How important is setting a focus target and in general, focus target macros in pvp?
[5:02:52] Aiakos21: you were in d stance tho
[5:03:00] Dirkdigglier: 'getting out of dstance' stays in dstance

[5:03:22] chrisiirc: @vortex221 im 2k spriest with 0 focus macros, not completely necessary
[5:03:26] Readyforbagels: make 2 macros D:
[5:03:31] Dirkdigglier: I will remain mad thanks for the tip
[5:03:44] chaps_86: @vortex221 pretty important to make focus macros (focus kick, cc, etc) that way you dont have to change targets to use certain abilities
[5:04:20] zachgamegodx: i don’t think it requires dmg done
[5:04:38] Extramediums: is Mage POM not dispellable any more?
[5:04:47] Extramediums: feel like the priest should have dispelled it since it was up forever
[5:04:57] yami96: mobility arms race, but its between mages and melee
[5:05:03] zachgamegodx: try death sentance into mage
[5:05:07] zachgamegodx: it’s fun as hell

[5:09:05] W00dyyx: I've never seen a DH not double jump everywhere
[5:09:26] W00dyyx: This is the most pedestrian DH ever
[5:09:56] Extramediums: dh's only need to use half their abilities most of the time for wins, so not surprising he's not using much lol
[5:10:04] filtertips: not worth disarm vs mm hunt?
[5:10:26] chrisiirc: i feel like dh is very effective at lower CR but the higher you get the more youre a kill target and die
[5:10:45] Extramediums: I don't know why but lately I've been disarming MM on their burst, but half the time they can still fire off aimed shot
[5:10:54] happyheals: need an ability called arms race that gives stacking dam buff to a damaging ability while moving  for a certain length of time, maybe 6 seconds. The further you travel the higher the dam buff.

[6:00:31] bdonlv: @Daviejones72 is it easy to play alts? i assume its the same process? also would i have to worry about weird grinds for rep or gear or "non-character" power?
[6:00:39] happyheals: happyheals gifted a Tier 1 sub to ChunLi! They have given 11 Gift Subs in the channel!

[6:01:17] mzaamentor: you're casting Ven?
[6:01:20] rekt1370: @chookitywow  press w key throw glaive and death sweep and you rank 1 KEKW
[6:01:22] Daviejones72: @Daviejones72 nope no rep or character powers to grind just the entry quests to each patch so you can get the crafted gear which takes like 30mins
[6:02:01] rekt1370: @bdonlv  can send honor from any character also
[6:02:18] gracioussatan: removes cheat death too

[6:03:23] Axtin: I think dk is the most common class I see
[6:03:25] bornbetter: wait
[6:03:30] rekt1370: yea dk is up there

[6:19:49] happyheals: I saw that had a lot of matches played
[6:19:57] rekt1370: boomy dh is good but sure dh dk better and boomy rogue better
[6:19:57] roberxsillo: Ven could you tell me what number or what is the name of the figure you choose in weakauras for when the target is at 30% of life?

[6:27:04] happyheals: they have options there
[6:28:17] malvarcla: surprised they arent hitting monk more
[6:29:01] Daviejones72: @malvarcla monks are super tanky vs melee now with the dodge talent and its chun XD
[6:29:07] novaspectv: play tripple pally
[6:29:18] Bigvuqoffdam: bm hunter :)
[6:29:18] Millehx: Ven, can you tell me. Do you think people wintrade late night in solo shuffle?
[6:29:30] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Finally arnace mage ! What up ven
[6:29:50] fazedoritoss: affy feels winnable until u fight a rogue or a frost dk
[6:29:54] Daviejones72: chun has been testing the dodge talent vs everything he's dodged alot of bashes
[6:29:55] malvarcla: @Daviejones72 Does he play that talent? I wanna try it out
[6:29:59] happyheals: no, I watch late games. People are pretty serious about their personal rating
[6:30:36] Millehx: Thats just it, they dont lose rating doing it. Only 1 targeted player loses rating
[6:30:40] PhDickens: depends on the disarm
[6:30:41] happyheals: unequip your weaponm
[6:30:50] bdonlv: !playlist
[6:30:50] Nightbot: Venruki's Spotify playlists can be found at https://open.spotify.com/user/1282291530 SeemsGood
[6:31:10] gracioussatan: only way around the BS cloak is hitting them from behind but good luck doing it reliably
[6:31:13] gracioussatan: without another rogue
[6:31:19] Daviejones72: @malvarcla yea he was playing it alot in 2s and i tried it aswell
[6:31:36] whspe: its off gcd ya
[6:31:56] Somanie: catJAM
[6:32:01] nightmxz: I have a great idea for rogues, want to hear it?
[6:32:15] Badasti: delete them?
[6:32:19] nightmxz: Give them prep back but attach it to their vanish
[6:32:20] Jeppsan: /delete
[6:32:21] flawfox: and you can’t be kicked on the spell school @venruki
[6:32:31] Millehx: Make cheap shot have a 3 second cooldown? :)
[6:32:33] gdodmebxu: @nightmxz KEKW
[6:32:37] nightmxz: jk someone at blizzard came up with it first KEKW
[6:32:45] leeka: lol
[6:32:45] betterbeup: Give mages aura mastery :)
[6:32:47] Gotheels: rouge has a high skill floor and are bad at low ratings tho so its fine
[6:33:04] jacob_the_mage: Sat 45 mins for shuffle just to have healer DC after round 1 ...
[6:33:06] jacob_the_mage: game is so good
[6:33:06] happyheals: resets their level to 1
[6:33:17] betterbeup: @Gotheels LOL?
[6:33:24] Badasti: its funny, we tried to go a rogue earlier, he cloaked the first go, vanished the second, evasioned the third, vanished the fourth, and his cloak was off cd again LUL
[6:33:29] Badasti: healer hadn't used anything yet
[6:33:36] ripzaddo: @Gotheels KEKW
[6:33:42] engzyng: what stats is born playing on his pala ?
[6:33:47] happyheals: double sub rogue is the dumbest thing
[6:33:48] Tackett86: i think giving cheapshot a short CD and not being spammable in dance/stealth would go a long way
[6:34:02] happyheals: you can handle the first 3 or 4 gos but then death
[6:34:09] Bigvuqoffdam: when you could actually catch them around pillars
[6:34:22] PhDickens: what if they changed eye so that it just forced the rogue out of stealth for 20 sec or whatever?
[6:34:23] nightmxz: Apparently Sombra in OW2 is a problem too because of permanent stealth, people can't kill her ever
[6:34:29] PhDickens: punishes running away and hiding
[6:34:38] happyheals: the rogues abuse the eye and get everyone instantly
[6:35:35] gdodmebxu: how would rogues finish torghast without permanent steath? Kappa
[6:36:07] betterbeup: I kinda lowkey miss torghast
[6:36:29] Badasti: oh MAH gawd, got some dire straits going here
[6:36:50] Badasti: play that gittaw
[6:37:02] Badasti: and get yo self a microwave oven
[6:37:08] porpster: lol
[6:37:34] happyheals: Dire Straits is also the state of Shadow Priest PVP
[6:37:59] gdodmebxu: sp isn't that bad, skillcapped just says they're just a victim class Kappa
[6:37:59] Badasti: if by that you mean epic then I agree with you sir
[6:38:07] Badasti: dire straits cant be beat
[6:38:26] Carmen_nem: ooh le arcane mage pog
[6:38:26] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[6:38:38] happyheals: I was going off what the video said. I like Spriest, but they are a victim class now
[6:38:50] bdonlv: awesome music btw
[6:38:52] gdodmebxu: 100% victim class Kappa
[6:39:01] whitra91: i fell too many tryhards in arena now

[6:39:44] gracioussatan: great song great band
[6:39:45] Freezzypop: where can I find the weakauro for your arcane battery buff?
[6:39:46] Zlipps: Class category is so destroyed now, a melee isn't a melee when it has better ranged attacks than a caster
[6:39:53] chirsen: hey ven, which mage specc would youb say is the best to climb in shuffle?
[6:39:57] chirsen: as a normal player
[6:39:58] chirsen: :D
[6:40:02] thisisthotcaller: imagine writing a song with the hardest guitar rift of all time and talk about color tvs in it
[6:40:02] Badasti: ah i get you
[6:40:02] gracioussatan: that dire straits song has some bad lyrics for streaming
[6:40:04] thisisthotcaller: wild
[6:40:10] Badasti: times changed and all
[6:40:17] Somanie: had a cat on top of me all day and I just knocked out for like 16 hours
[6:40:21] narthiz: @Badasti turns out a lot happens in 40 years
[6:40:28] Elozern: what was that song?
[6:40:32] ripzaddo: @chirsen arms
[6:40:32] Somanie: yessir

[6:40:46] happyheals: that is a coma
[6:40:51] Xeliumimar: im lucky to sleep 4 hours LOL
[6:40:52] Badasti: @Elozern dire straits - money for nothing
[6:41:02] thisisthotcaller: oooooof never realised that part of money for nothing
[6:41:03] thisisthotcaller: jeepers
[6:41:10] happyheals: weird al does a spoof of it
[6:41:29] Badasti: @Badasti if you like that also listen to sultans of swing - another great song
[6:41:31] Somanie: @happyheals yes <3 KEKW
[6:41:36] betterbeup: DH needs like 2-4 seconds more on each of their movement abilties, I mean shimmer is literally 23sec cd
[6:41:38] narthiz: @Badasti can confirm
[6:41:41] Bigvuqoffdam: poor ret paladins dont do damage :(
[6:42:01] gdodmebxu: they don't deserve to after the rework damage
[6:42:03] Elozern: @Badasti ye i know those songs but...I meant the one with a womens voice :D
[6:42:18] happyheals: I like the old groups like Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night
[6:42:27] fulvoustv: @venruki isnt it an interface option for the combo points below your omni bar?
[6:42:35] happyheals: ZZ Top
[6:42:38] Somanie: Foo Fighters will always be a goated band for me
[6:42:41] Badasti: @Elozern ah I didn't hear what Ven skipped, I was too busy being traumatised over the song skip XD
[6:43:38] Cdenzy: catJAM
[6:43:40] Badasti: @happyheals zz top is good, La Grange is my fav song
[6:43:54] Xeliumimar: first time i heard ven listening to billie elish lol
[6:44:03] McMillionx: we are getting them lol
[6:44:07] Somanie: side note but Billie Eilish's perfume slaps
[6:44:13] gdodmebxu: the chad classes only q into victim classes. it's the natural order
[6:44:21] tedo781: this comp seems like tough.
[6:44:31] oredsson1: @Somanie Indeed, my GF confirms
[6:44:33] nightmxz: Mage is a victim class? Why?
[6:44:38] zerx_gg: silly wizards
[6:44:43] Badasti: @nightmxz low rating, being a target dummy
[6:44:45] roberxsillo: Victim class ?
[6:44:52] Badasti: and cant rely on your donkey team mates in wood rank
[6:45:18] holyjeez1: billy eyelash is bae
[6:46:57] happyheals: I like all of ZZ Top and The Sidewalks. I like a cover they did in like 2012 called I Gotsta Get Paid
[6:47:08] happyheals: They covered thast 25 lighters on my dresser song
[6:47:35] Badasti: so in case anyone is looking for an alternative to razer products (I was using a razer naga and got sick of them always breaking) - I got a corsair scimitar elite (wireless mmo mouse) and it feels pretty good. Half the price
[6:47:39] Bigvuqoffdam: rukiDownGoes rukiDownGoes rukiDownGoes
[6:48:00] zerx_gg: best mouse on the market is the Logitech Pro X
[6:48:01] zerx_gg: no debate
[6:48:09] calerionxz: @badasti upvote
[6:48:18] NeroTVWoW: 2m
[6:48:22] gdodmebxu: best mouse is swifty approved naga for the best 1 shot macros
[6:48:28] drdoomkinx: 2min before vanish cdr
[6:48:29] swolecolemole: how is a dk supposed to ever touch a mage without clawing shadows tho lol
[6:48:40] ParanoiaOP: 2m in general yeah
[6:48:48] whspe: 2m always and then vanish resets it
[6:48:48] MaybeRespect: @swolecolemole not
[6:48:50] whspe: with two vanishes
[6:48:52] gdodmebxu: it's really 1 min 30 after both vanishes
[6:48:55] Badasti: @zerx_gg breh where are you hiding the other 10 buttons? coz that is the worst looking mmo mouse I ever saw :P
[6:48:55] leeka: gg
[6:48:56] ihavesmokedcrack: LOL
[6:48:56] Reiumi_: monkaW
[6:48:57] ihavesmokedcrack: so dead
[6:48:59] happyheals: wait for them to blink and grip
[6:49:00] oredsson1: PROCPOPPER X2
[6:49:01] subarUWUw: double ele
[6:49:02] snakefizz: bot cleave
[6:49:04] ihavesmokedcrack: SO DEAD! 100x meatballs
[6:49:07] whspe: bot cleave lol
[6:49:18] Xeliumimar: LUL
[6:49:20] NeroTVWoW: Botcleave comp lmfao
[6:49:25] ihavesmokedcrack: as a ele people that think you need a bot to do rotation makes me lol
[6:49:28] zerx_gg: 10 buttons? what are you talking about lil bro Badasti
[6:49:41] gdodmebxu: @ihavesmokedcrack it's not that anyone thinks you need it, it's that a bot can do it
[6:49:42] happyheals: vanish is basically 12 seconds
[6:49:44] Badasti: @zerx_gg yall need 12 buttons to be a power wow gamer son
[6:49:56] Somanie: @zerx_gg tbf when I Googled your mouse, it only shows like a wireless version with left, right, middle, and then two little buttons near left click KEKW
[6:50:10] zerx_gg: you dont need more than 2 buttons on a mouse
[6:50:12] zachgamegodx: it makes it affect 2 ppl and dispels the same effects on theenxt one so its like u can dispel 2 flame shocks on one guy and 2 on anoither
[6:50:12] zerx_gg: noobs get better
[6:50:17] zachgamegodx: its pretty good into something like this
[6:50:20] Badasti: @zerx_gg LUL
[6:50:21] zachgamegodx: they're both running one shot ubilds
[6:50:22] Somanie: I like having buttons 4 and 5 for Vuhdo healing
[6:50:30] Reiumi_: monkaLaugh
[6:51:21] happyheals: I used corsair mice for years and they all had the same issue. They would start double clicking after a year. I got a Logitech G Series Mouse on an Amazon Flash sale for $23 in 2019 and it is still working perfect
[6:51:23] ihavesmokedcrack: Dudes are hard casting lava! doubt its a bot! lol
[6:51:38] zerx_gg: people still use vuhdo? thats some 2007 tech
[6:51:42] slaughthemage: u need master sheperd gn ven
[6:52:36] Badasti: @happyheals I was the opposite, started on logitech and used them for like 17 years then switched to steelseries > corsair > razer > corsair. I am thinking of starting my own business and making keyboards and mice that actually last and work properly though
[6:52:49] ihavesmokedcrack: wait why was ele hard casting lightening bolt lol

[6:54:43] NeroTVWoW: They tried to ground your ring on the healer lol
[6:54:46] Bigvuqoffdam: "i love qing double caster comps"  "it should be illegal to play double ele"
[6:54:48] zerx_gg: i'd be very disappointed Somanie
[6:54:53] happyheals: mouseover macros are all you need for healing
[6:54:54] gdodmebxu: @Bigvuqoffdam KEKW

[6:58:54] Hizuru1: acting like df is any good.
[6:59:19] gdodmebxu: i really wanted d4 to be good :(
[6:59:30] lishyluu: d4 is like poe light for ppl with no time. i enjoy it for what it is
[6:59:42] lishyluu: poe is WAY better but my schedule doesnt let me hit endgame in a season
[6:59:45] Hizuru1: I think most of you dont even play it just repeat what you were told.
[6:59:47] happyheals: Everyone did, but in the Beta you could just feel how it was going to be
[7:00:03] gdodmebxu: i played d4, if i want to play a game like that i'd just play poe
[7:00:21] bigpapafood: love seeing dh dk lose

[7:17:13] betterbeup: @chrye_xx Idk man, out of the top 25k, there's 11k healers, and there's only 2 healers in each lobby compared to 4 dps, so technically there is more healers
[7:17:21] gdodmebxu: @chrye_xx pikaboo gets pretty high rated on random alt healers

[7:20:38] nikthevoker: FACTS
[7:20:41] Taevenx: didn't moran say 1800 is harder than like 2100+?
[7:20:45] IGna7iusIV: dh giving warrior leap energy
[7:20:53] Taevenx: LOL
[7:21:05] L0wrush: cause on 2100 you can predict what people do
[7:21:11] Schnellmusic: absolute god-tier song
[7:21:27] happyheals: now he plays flawlessly
[7:21:36] nikthevoker: HES doing so much healing WTF LUL
[7:22:14] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Yeah that's some insane healing from the lock
[7:22:27] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Prob a full HP dark pact with wall up, can make the dark pact huge
[7:22:55] gdodmebxu: well lock is a victim class
[7:23:11] atomic_gossipgirlxo: In some lobbies it sure can be haha and in other lobbies it's a god class
[7:23:18] bokioz: Guys, is 1400 in shuffle like 2000 rating in season 1?
[7:23:26] taylorperiod: @nikthevoker swear ive never seen another hpal heal this much
[7:23:30] Taevenx: smartest DH player
[7:23:47] nikthevoker: mies would be jealous
[7:23:57] chrye_xx: I never want to see a DH meta ever again

[7:24:21] gdodmebxu: kyrian oneshot?
[7:24:24] xDroozyy: kyrian goremaw build does massive dmg
[7:24:24] 인터넷포트: Venmies should be u holy pally name
[7:24:51] dooshken: morning coffee in the evening Pog
[7:24:56] happyheals: I mean he ran in both games los not using cds with you
[7:24:57] betterbeup: Kyrian only hits for 200k if you spec everything for it, it's not worth it.
[7:25:15] atomic_gossipgirlxo: I don't think that's true
[7:25:16] gdodmebxu: with rotten and perf it's more than 200k
[7:25:19] gdodmebxu: but takes a lot of set up
[7:25:35] betterbeup: Nope I did eveyr talent for it , and it hit for max 250k on a clothy
[7:25:46] gdodmebxu: 250 is a lot more than 200k Kappa
[7:26:06] kyleuselton: hahahah he said i wanna heal you lol
[7:26:21] joyrex_j9: tyr's deliverance gets a different name every time its casted
[7:27:48] boltqt_: feel like he ran the right way there
[7:28:12] happyheals: well fought
[7:28:14] punkzl0l: why do you play with healthbar at top left? So much less eye movement to put it above ur spells
[7:28:14] yesterday_potato: lol when 3-3 is relief
[7:28:16] Itankarenas: +1 EZ Clap
[7:28:21] leeka: buff warlocks
[7:28:21] Reiumi_: +2 lets go!
[7:28:24] yesterday_potato: i feel it
[7:28:27] L0wrush: hardest 1,9k mmr game in history :D
[7:28:29] Itankarenas: oh +2 cr ig
[7:28:40] gamerdadhooper: that hunter was grieving you that last round ;-(
[7:28:40] ferahgok: @punkzl0l I just look at party frames when healing
[7:28:49] Taevenx: LOL i played with that DH the other day, same exciting gameplay
[7:29:06] happyheals: nah he was having a hard time, he did his best
[7:29:09] Badasti: wot you mean you got a dh
[7:29:10] nikthevoker: it is
[7:29:13] gracioussatan: doesn't tier auto glave throw
[7:29:17] punkzl0l: i feel the nerf on DH coming
[7:29:23] chrye_xx: it’ll be the quickest rating climb of your life
[7:29:27] chrye_xx: I refuse to play DH
[7:29:34] Holtan3111: are you open to new bands ? :)
[7:29:34] ItsJhelo: Tbh DH is simpler but I find them really fun, even if they had a dps nerf Id still play
[7:29:34] davegoodwin1982: insanely easy spec
[7:29:38] davegoodwin1982: do it
[7:29:40] nikthevoker: iits almost like ret rework
[7:29:44] Badasti: i think you should leggo
[7:29:45] punkzl0l: would be a good topic for youtube video
[7:29:46] Yukimes: u just show up and top dam
[7:29:51] happyheals: giving rogue more utility was the dumbest idea ever. That is all I need to say
[7:30:00] Taevenx: every game I've played has had DH, DK or War absolutely just train the other team's healer every round
[7:30:03] Dwilk20: You say they are tanky till you get a Sub rogue in your lobby
[7:30:08] yungtropikal: make a video about how easy it is to play to bm the dhs SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[7:30:11] Dwilk20: and every cheap shot you can be 100-0ed lol
[7:30:26] gamerdadhooper: could i perhaps see yu talent tree, cause i cant tell what talent causes 4-5 reclamtions (this is what i see in yur trufi addon)
[7:30:30] didgeridoo1001: That should be the challenge. How fast can you get 2K on DH
[7:30:33] ItsJhelo: tbh people think they are easier than they are, DK, Arms, and rogue are also very easy to play
[7:30:34] Taevenx: yessir
[7:30:41] ItsJhelo: as in easy climb
[7:31:11] punkzl0l: feels like im no longer special
[7:31:15] skydog70: Next thing you know ret pallies will get auto bubble back
[7:31:16] Shezzmou: your tier list got called out in the new the Skill Capped video lol
[7:31:17] happyheals: isn't it like 1.5 min
[7:31:17] IamWalnuts: ret pallys cant read so ty for reading it for them
[7:31:18] Reiumi_: Prayge
[7:31:19] ImShmoly: i love gouge an ability but sub having it rn feels too good
[7:31:19] tarth_100: you can still hit them from behind though, right (still broken but just asking)
[7:31:20] punkzl0l: every class has bubbles now
[7:31:22] atosunor: they still die to fall dmg :D
[7:31:28] happyheals: yeah the cdr
[7:31:32] Badasti: i like that dh has an ice block that allows them to move for the duration
[7:31:38] 인터넷포트: What rating do u get the white paladin pvp set?
[7:31:38] Taevenx: not a huge fan, but doesn't surprise me
[7:31:46] dooshken: have you done the outland cup?
[7:31:50] IamWalnuts: World of Roguecraft for a reason
[7:31:50] 420blazeityoloswag4jesus: I've never felt good as a ret main. seems like the only spec in the game blizz is worried about class fanatacy while balancing
[7:31:53] SteLawBro: Remember when rogues could spam sprint? How did that make you feel druids?
[7:31:58] wicked_wizurd: rouges needed it for class fantasy if you're in the shadows you shouldn't be able to be hit
[7:31:59] Elozern: i just found out today that cloak also gives rogues 100% dodge
[7:32:01] chrye_xx: rogues keep a lot of classes in check too though
[7:32:04] Elozern: brilliant idea btw
[7:32:05] chrye_xx: still too op rn
[7:32:11] gamerdadhooper: this is a long morning stream, me likey :D
[7:32:13] 인터넷포트: Do u know what rating gets the next transmog pvp set
[7:32:17] mzaamentor: they have 2 evas basically
[7:32:18] mzaamentor: LOL
[7:32:18] arcane_p: you can still be attacked from behind lol
[7:32:26] Badasti: @Elozern funny thing is many of them don't play with it because they dont need it
[7:32:30] Sunyankzi: @wicked_wizurd Burst of Speed was great.
[7:32:36] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Cause costco keeps the costs low
[7:32:37] leeka: from where?
[7:32:38] happyheals: Rogues are gonna be in stealth when the devs look to nerf them. So it won't happen
[7:32:41] lawsonst: Sketch lobby - mist weaver output is insane
[7:32:43] egrounds: won't be as good as a treager burger
[7:32:50] Cyppz: did it get buffed? it was 50% right?
[7:32:52] mzaamentor: AW is good af
[7:32:53] leeka: mozza burger with onion rings bis
[7:32:56] Taevenx: I'm convinced 90% of Rets die because bub is on GCD
[7:32:58] 인터넷포트: u got AW in Canada
[7:32:59] 인터넷포트: da fuqqq
[7:33:03] taylorperiod: we dont have AW down here anymore :(
[7:33:04] zachgamegodx: the sword of Wynn
[7:33:05] Elozern: @Badasti ye why would they...they have 2x vanish lol
[7:33:11] leeka: A&w here is so goofd

[7:39:54] PeptoAbysmal: the dude is fried
[7:40:03] Dirkdigglier: Tims is still good idk why its so trendy to hate on it now

I did notice that when I started being only positive, say NJ after every win and NT after every loss, and trying to offer compliments on specific things, and so far, I've had 5 people that raged at me while I was healing whisper and apologize afterwards and say thanks
[7:40:51] xxbearrcattxx: a and w has pretty good coffee too
[7:40:51] happyheals: I prob haven't had a donut in 15 years

[7:42:45] yungtropikal: like 1900ish
[7:42:47] mzaamentor: doesn't surprise me coming from a dragon either, they're the ranged dh's
[7:42:49] atomic_gossipgirlxo: @Dirkdigglier You can do it on your own team, yourself, or an enemy. But yes, full immunity.
[7:43:00] chrye_xx: does binding shot count as a root DR and stun DR?

[7:46:21] Kaxan82: how rude
[7:46:22] Badasti: who da bitch now moment
[7:46:25] aragarde: yep projecting
[7:46:25] kusoneko: solo shuffle life
[7:46:29] VetisBR: the old i fucked up but you are an R word trick
[7:46:30] kittarie: unnecessary rudeness regardless

[7:47:09] atomic_gossipgirlxo: Thought you were gyming?
[7:47:20] aragarde: he needs reflection and realize he messed up and cooked his goose
[7:47:24] zachgamegodx: he doesn’t have an inner voice prolly
[7:47:25] klikka: @venruki loot ur vault
[7:47:26] dooshken: @Xeliumimar prolly
[7:47:28] happyheals: probably too dense to realize they overreacted
[7:47:29] Extramediums: I think you should report that honestly. People like that don't learn unless there's consequences
[7:47:30] snulli: it’s always the same shit happening in solo shuffle; someone messes up and starts blaming everyone else
[7:47:34] gamerdadhooper: eeeeeh letsgooo
[7:47:37] 420blazeityoloswag4jesus: I already reported him for everything available
[7:47:40] notkoalars: Pog
[7:47:43] Asylah: Wish people were less selfcentered, its not the words that anyone has an issue with its the fact that its his fault yet he blames someone else

[7:47:51] notkoalars: 6-0 incoming for the pooper
[7:47:59] Elozern: there is always 1 more shuffle
[7:48:07] SteLawBro: I broke up with a woman recently who could never take accountability for her actions. Nothing was her fault. Its the worst.
[7:48:09] demololtv: im in a new lobby w the same evoker
[7:48:13] Dirkdigglier: What are you upto in the gym nowadays? Just maintenance or working on certain goals?
[7:48:17] gamer_dad_01: no way you go 0-6

[7:49:20] snulli: 196 no way
[7:49:22] SteLawBro: @Asylah Thx, its no biggie. Sometimes it just is what it is 🤷
[7:49:28] happyheals: what if what they did was a new 5000 iq troll to get in your head

[7:55:10] lawsonst: That was a nasty round
[7:55:10] shinydunsparce: 6-0 is basically  impossible since theres always 1 window licker dps
[7:55:14] Xeliumimar: is Slamdunker a paid actor, JK LUL
[7:55:35] notkoalars: these are the only classes you see at higher mmr lol
[7:55:38] IGna7iusIV: @shinydunsparce unless the healer is the biggest window licker in the room
[7:56:01] notkoalars: and I’m just a lonely lonely boomy
[7:56:41] shinydunsparce: @IGna7iusIV ha, could be. but if there were healers as bad as dps, queues wouldn't be so long

[7:58:56] betterbeup: I think it's weird game balance that the easiest classes with the lowest skill ceilings are the highest rated people.
[7:59:06] betterbeup: on average ofcourse
[7:59:11] Dirkdigglier: Thats only in shuffle though
[7:59:38] Reiumi_: monkaW
