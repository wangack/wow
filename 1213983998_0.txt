[1:01:00] tankatrono_o: If you only drink a cup off coffee at a timeand not a big coffee consumer Espresso/one cup coffee machines arent that bad, if you like several i would say a regular brewer is the way to go

[1:35:10] iManley: hey swifty, ranks updated
[1:35:18] watching_streams_man: 4 different versions of world of warcraft
[1:35:19] spacemarine55: it was a fundamental reasoning ... horde played horde in classic they obviously they wanna play the other faction this tiem around
[1:35:22] Gizimoo86: swifty went to wrong side rip
[1:35:48] iManley: swifty read above... ranks updated
[1:35:53] rajarr70: im gonna play destro lock for dungeons, no time to put dots to use on mobs anyway, afflic is for raids
[1:35:53] watching_streams_man: BWL is going to be out when ure 60 :D
[1:36:13] fubar8peace: they are more tryhard than horde players atm
[1:36:15] spacemarine55: alliance leved up fast because their starter zones are better
[1:36:15] Stangin2122: It has to do with raiding and they bosses health pools increase and extra mech.  No world buffs in raids. So they went Ally for the Pally. Pally buffs are the best
[1:36:17] Mystaleon: no lifing it harder than you guys :P
[1:36:18] JayBinski: Alliance have an easier all around leveling experience
[1:36:24] Alex_Anderson97: They are questing Swifty :D
[1:36:24] Cybernytez: maybe they have better organized groups and they spam dungeons idk
[1:36:36] spacemarine55: elvs can stay darnasus till 14 then have darkshore till 20

[1:36:48] jareds21: Alliance have pvp discords
[1:36:49] iManley: and rank is updated swift
[1:36:50] fubar8peace: also certain area's for alliance are better for leveling faster at low levels because of less traveling and quests being closer
[1:37:03] Cowardpatty: Making me switch over from work laptop just to point out it's NightFALL, not scale
[1:37:04] Cowardpatty: lol
[1:37:11] spacemarine55: both humans and draves/gnomes have it easy with easy tranist via subway to both the strting zones and can skip westfall for lochmodan
[1:37:13] jopieknettah: Its worse
[1:37:21] jopieknettah: Then ur own windfury
[1:37:26] maraz909: How good xp are BGs instead of pve lvling?
[1:37:28] fubar8peace: only shows 50 people
[1:37:32] fubar8peace: not true numbers
[1:37:32] spacemarine55: also getting to darkshore as a dwarf/human/gnome was made easy because death runs spawns you closer now
[1:37:34] diabl712: probably more hardcore players on alliance
[1:37:36] JayBinski: your windfury you put on yourself is better than the totem @Swifty you need to use your own even when dropping winfury for everyone else

[1:38:02] Gizimoo86: type who 30-50
[1:38:03] jopieknettah: Always use ur own windfury
[1:38:04] Cybernytez: im EU and it feels like more horde here, maybe its different in NA
[1:38:04] JayBinski: @Swifty your windfury you put on yourself is better than the totem you need to use your own even when dropping winfury for everyone else
