[0:35:04] Renfuryy: is there a difference? isnt it just marketing?
[0:35:09] el_agu_89: @penilelol I gots u
[0:35:12] theman10n: haha
[0:35:33] Farikov: In the realm of ice cream and confections, the words "vanilla" and "French vanilla" often grace menus and ingredient lists. But what exactly is the distinction between these two popular flavors, and how do they contribute to our culinary experiences? Really, vanilla needs no introduction. It's classic, universally loved taste and aroma has found its way into countless applications, from creamy desserts to fragrant candles. In its purest form, vanilla comes from the fruit of the vanilla orchid
[0:35:39] Renfuryy: The main difference between vanilla and French vanilla ice cream is the addition of egg yolks in French vanilla ice cream. This gives French vanilla ice cream a richer, creamier texture and more complex vanilla flavor
[0:35:42] siggysudzz: ORLY ReallyNow
[0:35:48] penilelol: we've got ice cream experts here
[0:35:51] penilelol: jeezus
[0:35:52] Farikov: ICANT
[0:35:53] el_agu_89: Omg
[0:36:19] Renfuryy: While both have a rich vanilla flavor, the primary difference comes from the source of vanilla. French vanilla uses French vanilla syrup with a mix of hazelnut to provide a creamy, nutty flavor. On the other hand, vanilla coffee incorporates plain vanilla syrup or extract.
[0:36:22] johnrush: raw eggs?
[0:36:25] Renfuryy: yeah basically
[0:36:26] Renfuryy: keking
[0:36:33] Farikov: 5Head

[0:37:52] valandurrr: @Jhova91 the vikings fooled us
[0:37:53] Jhova91: someone said that to me once, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true
[0:38:04] penilelol: it's kinda true
[0:38:16] penilelol: it was to bait people into not coming or something i forgot the history abt it
[0:38:24] scassel85: I learned that from Mighty Ducks 2
[0:38:29] Jhova91: like that one SpongeBob episode 50% sea 50% weed lolz
[0:39:03] penilelol: iceland's origin is basically a bunch of norwegians wanted to not pay taxes to norway and went someplace else
