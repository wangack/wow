[1:35:06] bariumjones: there's plenty of variety just not at literally the highest level of competition @leethomo123
[1:35:08] Bendie_EU: new affix: Blixt
[1:35:11] jenkinsdonuttv: @bariumjones agreed I mean in everyday play you can have a lot of variety but people are asking for every class/spec to be 100% the same value for this very high end content to be more varied
[1:35:22] domax92: they are doing a tournment and playing the highest keys in the world, ofc they play the best comp
[1:35:24] Esotraz: @blackmaija to make sure nobody has fun
[1:35:51] domax92: the silly thing is people that want those same classes for a 20
[1:35:58] Pilotsfp: destro still pump even after nerf
[1:36:02] Bashiel: even if the difference between all specs would be .5% the teams would still be the same
[1:36:10] KegzyTv: Every game has a meta you guys, stop being weird about it.
[1:36:20] Esotraz: its destru not destro
[1:36:25] jenkinsdonuttv: @domax92 true it's kinda silly

[5:17:57] 99corsair: @inspirox had this happen yesterday, we kicked and still got hit with it
[5:18:02] Arauthor: honestly don't think the bug would've mattered. damage would've been super tight and i think they might've missed it
[5:18:07] fragileplasma: @Valdrastar because its the world record with these set of affixes
[5:18:23] inspirox: @99corsair and they don't wanna talk about it lol. hopefully it get fixed
[5:18:38] Ravoks: it was def a bug, but regardless I think the damage was slightly slow enough to time it regardless
[5:18:45] Shroomztm: @Valdrastar cuz it sounds better
[5:18:54] Daveireland: Its literally not a bug. Its to do with boss hp % phasing. Their rogue didnt kick fast enough you can go check Trells vod

[5:48:32] odawgxd: @Traxirage Ofc u can. but u cannot give away a pi :>
[5:48:41] brotan123: thats funny because rdruid does more dps than a hpriest (excluding pi)

[5:50:49] notjoao1: anywhere to see gear?
[5:50:51] odawgxd: @Ninjadagger Usually u take 1 guy into the smash with a defensive so tank takes 50% less dmg and the dps mitigates his part
