[0:58:31] Gorshun: I think it was a bit higher than 10k
[0:58:31] neuroxin: yep
[0:58:33] Nunadaaa: LULW
[0:58:38] geennaamnl1: I never wanted to enslave my pokemons and fight for me
[0:58:46] DucktorLarsen: pretty sure the cost was a few million dollars

[0:59:41] HeadShot794: OM
[0:59:41] Ewriick: om
[0:59:41] Nunadaaa: the more this happens the better for the market, cause big companies like EA and ubishit etc need a kick under their but and actually produce a good game instead of re-serving us the same reskinned game for 10 years
[0:59:46] 1Emii1: OM

[1:00:48] stygge96: @Guzu 6,7mil is nothing
[1:00:48] hekalaios: 10k is wild
[1:00:49] 1Emii1: OM
[1:00:49] nenoftw123: marketing and everything is maybe 6m, the development 10k
[1:00:50] MajoVapo: they started with 10k
[1:00:50] Nunadaaa: not in game development
[1:00:51] Blufootgaming: guzu do you understand how absurd this large of a game being 10k is????
[1:00:51] flowerpew: 7 million is not a lot for a video game
[1:00:53] Blixia: its from their previous game
[1:00:53] safari3: It was 50 bucks
[1:00:54] raiwist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvh0nX08nRw&ab_channel=AlexeyKutepov this guy says 10k so idk
[1:00:56] sir_sammi: Making a game is expensive
[1:00:57] moo__snuckle: 10k is like one employee for a month
[1:00:58] paco__gutierrez: Nah 7 mill is very low
[1:00:59] myst_u: this game was made for 6,7 mil?
[1:01:02] mcboonee: 6 mill is not much
[1:01:02] DucktorLarsen: 7 mil is low
[1:01:05] Gorshun: not a lot for a game these days
[1:01:05] gazargh: 10k wouldnt pay staff for 1 month
[1:01:07] Nunadaaa: its not
[1:01:09] Nunadaaa: LUL
[1:01:09] mcboonee: it sold 6 mill games lol
[1:01:11] TheGoatyus: Aware
[1:01:13] Quniss: Quniss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hey Gugatron - At what time did you want me to swing by with the Chili Cheese tops today? I heard Savix offered you a 100 Cheese tops challenge and he would give you a free wish
[1:01:13] StreamElements: Quniss just subscribed for 15 months in a row PogChamp
[1:01:13] Blufootgaming: for a game with this much reach 7mil makes sense
[1:01:13] mcboonee: math that
[1:01:15] neuroxin: 7 mil is crazy low G
[1:01:15] Katabolic: 10k was from an interview from one of the devs wasn't it
[1:01:15] DemigodzLegacy: 5k is the first friday the 13th and that was in the early 80s
[1:01:15] TowerOfMourn: how tf do you think you make a game for 10k? 6 mil is not a lot of money to develop something big
[1:01:17] Blufootgaming: games are expensive
[1:01:17] azshare_: 10k doesnt pay a single salary
[1:01:18] DarlingOwe: Maybe that's Lethal company 10k?
[1:01:20] Fink108: 6.7 mill is a small budget video games are bigger than hollywood now
[1:01:21] PinkkRose: 6mil sounds insane considering they didnt even have real unreal programmers and had to do it without any knowledge pmuch
[1:01:22] Tyro369: Its 7 million for 4 years is low guys
[1:01:23] CamGG__: this video seems not happy om
[1:01:24] nenoftw123: let them reveal the revenu now and 7 will be 0.1%
[1:01:27] Dakix: 8 mil copys
[1:01:30] shadowtrip32: Google says 1 billion yen
[1:01:32] Schmuts93: Cod moderwarfare was around 300milion budget
[1:01:32] joggetur: They have multiple games on steam, so dont know how they could say "No idea how steam let us publish Palworld on steam"
[1:01:36] Ewriick: 10k doesnt get you 4 good-enough development PCs, it can't be true
[1:01:36] Nicrot: om
[1:01:37] myst_u: 7 milllion is high if its such a crap game
[1:01:39] mcboonee: + boosts company stocks
[1:01:40] mcboonee: id imagine
[1:01:52] Nunadaaa: the harry potter game was 150~ mil production costs for example guzu
[1:01:54] snygglejf: i heard something about 10k for the pals models or something.
[1:02:07] chummbles: baseg
[1:02:08] Elendayer: @Guzu a normal AAA game to today is 50 million to 200 million going up to 600 million for the most expensive ones

[1:02:19] raiwist: plus the license lol
[1:02:23] DemigodzLegacy: but the dif between 10k and 150mil is not small
[1:02:27] MajoVapo: @nunadaaa i think this was mostly invested in the HP brand license
[1:02:28] Ewriick: 10k is nothing, barely gives you 4 good PCs for it
[1:02:33] specialkidmiles: 10k and made by UI was the fucking meme that was going around
[1:02:40] Exusprime: Why are we comparing AAA companies to an indie company
[1:02:44] StripSniper: honestly making a game is easy, but bigger you get more jobs are created such as CS,QA etc. etc.
[1:02:48] Blufootgaming: you should be
[1:02:54] Ewriick: why not? that should be included in it
[1:02:55] BALtaram: the 10k budget is a meme
[1:02:56] hanttapuliukko: But I mean it should be a part of it
[1:02:57] raiwist: how much of that 10k was spent on nore torn hmmMeeting

[1:09:26] specialkidmiles: Enshrouded doesn't have fishing though
[1:09:39] Egyptian_Joe: No palworld had 2m
[1:09:51] gazargh: if you want to try enshrouded, just play Valheim
[1:10:00] Trexbo_: Pretty simple video overall, I wish he would've elaborated on why he thought the game was average (considering Palworld just takes elements from other successful games) ABOBA

[1:10:20] krulfar: if Enshrouded is actually good they just need to put a bit of effort on marketing and an update in a couple of months to bring people to the game
[1:10:21] DemigodzLegacy: and for the price its worht
[1:10:21] neuroxin: not everyone enjoys survival simulators tho, palworld pulls in people who wouldn't normally play these types of games
