[7:26:05] darknova7777: That is too much
[7:26:05] turn2spikejester: gdkp, most toxic way to raid in WoW
[7:26:06] darknova7777: Lol
[7:26:08] Peezo425: no they were being lazy on trash
[7:26:13] darknova7777: Just play the game

[7:26:46] delennotv: leecher
[7:26:50] Knaxxis: good players like GDKp's and casual baddies dont
[7:27:00] Entoxic13: yep
[7:27:08] Knaxxis: gdkp isnt for the guy who wants to get drunk and raid with his friends
[7:27:11] Kowwen: getting docked is stupid
[7:27:12] foresstgumper: for under performing and not buying
[7:27:13] DFCIII: they still down bosses
[7:27:17] BraydonWads: gdkp is nice once you are full bis

[7:27:26] ernestos1: but does the raid leader give himself a cut if he doesnt buy something is the real question
[7:27:28] HeIlraiser_: People dont save for gold they buy it LUL
[7:27:38] dunex69: gdkp is the best way to raid
[7:27:45] Knaxxis: u dont deserve the same payout as someone else that that over preformed if u didnt lol
[7:27:48] bigboypants1320: Lol @knaxxis  keep telling yourself that
[7:27:52] Knaxxis: thatrs just the gimme stuff for free mindset
[7:27:52] portugues01: @HeIlraiser_ ye
[7:28:00] DFCIII: and people buy gold in retail lol who cares
[7:28:05] revora_: no boomy
[7:28:10] Kowwen: They are only docking people so they can get more gold, its a scam
[7:28:10] Entoxic13: well raiding in your guild is the best way but gdkp is the best for pugging
[7:28:20] turn2spikejester: @Knaxxis top guilds dontgaf about GDKPs
[7:28:22] Nalmeena: Getting cut in half for underperforming on trash seems wrong. I'd understand if they underperformed on a boss fight.
[7:28:23] HeIlraiser_: it supports players who dont want to spend much time playing but ARE happy to buy it with real world money lol
[7:28:25] ernestos1: @Kowwen AGREEED

[12:11:36] DarkKeatMasters: youll gain rage by getting hit thats why you can rage dump with heroic strike at 50+ rage
[12:11:46] BrainlagsEverywhere: @Swifty if i recall correctly, if you queue heroic strike/cleave, you "lose" rage instead of gaining on next weapon swing

[12:14:48] zzohanxd: armory pls
