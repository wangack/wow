[4:33:58] Smith6612: @CallMeInfinity They actually work over here. But yeah, upload stinks. 42Mbps up. Download is 1,200Mbps though.  My area has two Fiber ISPs, one of which is a block away for the last decade, another which just started building in my area and sells up to 2Gbps symmetrical on residential. Hope one of them shows up in the next year.
[4:34:33] Smith6612: So yeah LULW
[4:34:37] CallMeInfinity: i think comcast or some subsidary of them like xfinity or some shit does 2gbps but i thought they werent symmetrical
[4:35:01] Smith6612: @CallMeInfinity Gigabit Pro? It's actually 2Gbps Symmetrical + 1Gbps Symmetrical via Fiber!
