[1:57:47] NurfMe206: i love this, both people going off to thier viewers
[1:57:56] thommy_brasco: i mean good players also calls like the next 5 globals so both know whats gno happen and what is to do
[1:57:59] soulsourcex: would have been a /leave party for me after that childish display.
[1:58:07] thommy_brasco: like he said the one game "will retail in 5 sec"
[1:58:10] Ripper10: kick him
[1:58:24] karpokrat: So bottom line is, people in wow have not changed in 20 years
[1:58:35] shucoco: I simply think shinta is too rigid. You meant to say that you are a successful healer and he shouldnt question your decision making
[1:58:49] shucoco: For example in the spm game
[1:58:50] simstarx: maybe this is why he usually is off voice, he knows he can't accept any other than his opinions :(
[1:58:54] vermitv: its all about ego bro not a lot achived 30 ssns + rank 1 bro
[1:59:07] vermitv: there is no reason to excuse ur self
[1:59:08] shucoco: If you line of sight ur pala during bubble yr fucking trolling
[1:59:11] BroyWonder: bring a pschero and next him Kappa
[1:59:18] notmorbos: the "he sacced 2s before retal" argument was so funny too, no shit bro his warrior told him to do it
[1:59:30] Lindelf: he said Dsac maybe
[1:59:38] drtybit: dsac :D
[1:59:43] foshurex: castellio gigachad

[3:24:56] Brodin1231: @modnartsom thats not how debating works, if someone tates something and someone denies it, the one denying has to come with proof

[4:50:54] CozyKhayla: @faithfulqt ^
[4:51:08] niightstarr: shinta is trolling :D
[4:51:25] mathematician3: If you didn't  quit retail and never come back after WoD release you straight up trolling
[4:51:37] pipebomblive: @CozyKhayla I mean, Cata hit and the game was great. MoP hit and it felt like a completely different version of the game to me, and I didn't hate it, but then WoD felt way different from MoP so I don't disagree
[4:51:41] Dheafie: they way he peaked for the first downstairsgrip ScaredyCat
[4:51:56] pipebomblive: but I don't think WoD was as bad as people say. Especially looking back at shit like Legion, BFA, SL, and DF
[4:51:56] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[4:52:13] CozyKhayla: @faithfulqt for me it was just trash because of the content draught and garrisons. Garrisons seemed like a fun idea until blizzard actually implemented it >.<
[4:52:17] dankgamer97: yea idk why he had to peak there
[4:52:48] CozyKhayla: i didnt mind legion, its the exp i quit wow in but id take legion over bfa and wod every day of the week
[4:53:02] mathematician3: @CozyKhayla I instant quit after  the model changes and spell pruning
[4:53:07] souljuhwitch: had a chance to judge pet there
[4:53:09] JThundermvp: legion had great content and the best, 2 month season with changes every season
[4:53:14] JThundermvp: imagine something like this
[4:53:16] pipebomblive: @CozyKhayla Garrisons by FAR are the WORST thing to ever happen to WoW. Player housing is cool, but it also caused players to never leave their garrisons. Why would you when you're in your own instance and the world lag is nonexistant. Made the outside world feel dead af
[4:53:27] souljuhwitch: yeah hindsight is 20/20
[4:53:34] pipebomblive: only games that did player housing right was FFXIV and Wildstar
[4:53:46] souljuhwitch: wall was 100% a waste
[4:53:52] mathematician3: @faithfulqt tbh I didn't give a fuck about garrison, what made me instnat quit in WoD was model changes and spell pruning. I was left with no class idenentiy and hardly any spells on release
[4:54:22] pipebomblive: I wasn't a fan of spell pruning. Cata bars was nice for me, and MoP was stretching it but ok
[4:54:32] pipebomblive: WoD and later on I feel like my bars aren't even fully covered in abilities..
[4:54:39] censoredwomanx: Wackd is Wackzy or?
[4:54:43] certylb: yes
[4:54:47] 1337unkwn: no
[4:54:50] censoredwomanx: yes
[4:54:52] NurfMe206: maybe
[4:55:03] CozyKhayla: @faithfulqt yeah i just imagine running through the zone where the garrisons was and it being completely barron. I do think it would be cool if they implemented player housing like that of ffxiv where its purely cosmetic, but with garrisons u had to farm and shit and ew
[4:55:12] certylb: yeah i just imagine running through the zone where the garrisons was and it being completely barron. I do think it would be cool if they implemented player housing like that of ffxiv where its purely cosmetic, but with garrisons u had to farm and shit and ew
[4:55:35] CozyKhayla: @mathematician3 i didnt mind the model changes but wod was just so desolate i feel and it never ever came back
[4:55:47] pipebomblive: I agree ^
[4:56:10] fianso26i: Hi, is possible to have the name of your addons ?

[5:02:07] drsnugglemuppet: i have to pre sac hoj openers just to keep my warrior up in mirrors
[5:02:36] NurfMe206: @mathematician3 he just got everything to proc at the start, massive pressure
[5:03:01] pipebomblive: it's so sad to me that it won't happen anymore. I remember them saying in MoP or WoD that they never wanted WoW to be an esport
[5:03:08] pipebomblive: and imo it had so much potential
[5:04:46] venusprojectz: but iirc there were tourneys back in wotlk

[5:05:09] uninspire: thats kinda copium
[5:05:09] pipebomblive: that's fucking insane
[5:05:11] Turaxyy: a bit copium
[5:05:16] Turaxyy: bro
[5:05:18] Turaxyy: do you realise
[5:05:18] Xeckslol: I fully believe it
[5:05:19] Turaxyy: how big league is
[5:05:21] uninspire: thats crazy copium
[5:05:24] braphlol: huuuge cope, wow pvp is so hard to watch
[5:05:24] Antiquasar: back in the days of mop wow was massive
[5:05:26] ExehnTV: Problem with wow it sucks to watch it's too hard to follow
[5:05:28] xarlivenow: but wow is a bad esports due to gearing and the dynamic of the game itself
[5:05:29] uninspire: league is popular because its accessible, not jsut easy to spectate
[5:05:30] Xeckslol: Blizzard were just trash at all e-sports
[5:05:35] Antiquasar: blizzcon on justintv got 250k views
[5:05:37] Turaxyy: ye no one can't rly be comapred w league
[5:05:38] Turaxyy: rn
[5:05:39] BroyWonder: just buy toys Kappa
[5:05:40] Blixxy: league fell off a lot from what it used to be
[5:05:40] Turaxyy: impossible
[5:05:42] drsnugglemuppet: WoW arena make a game of that man
[5:05:43] Rhivnn: What do they need to do different?
[5:05:45] kooolzin: @braphlol and league is easy to watch?
[5:05:46] Turaxyy: worldwide wise
[5:05:46] pipebomblive: right but if WoW had been funneling as much love into arena tournies as they did MDI or RWF
[5:05:52] NurfMe206: @drsnugglemuppet its called overwatch
[5:05:57] pipebomblive: since Wrath or MoP even
[5:05:58] Turaxyy: league is way easier tyo watch @kooolzin
[5:06:01] Dudunkov: Watching WoW arenas is way too chaotic and requires a lot of knowledge for it to be enjoyable for average player
[5:06:06] Turaxyy: wow is terrible to watch even for mediuml players
[5:06:08] braphlol: league pulls 300k on twitch, and thats not even the biggest platform
[5:06:08] hophell_pal: Minpojkeeee <3
[5:06:10] dromed_xd: i just joined, what are we talking about
[5:06:13] mistr_matt: what does more effort mean? what you think they could do?
[5:06:14] xarlivenow: wow needs to be way more simple to become an esport
[5:06:18] mathematician3: WoW esports got crazy views in 2010
[5:06:23] kooolzin: @Turaxyy wow is hard to watch because blizzard has the worst ui in history
[5:06:28] Antiquasar: yeah it was massive
[5:06:32] Turaxyy: nowaday the ui is okay
[5:06:33] chimpules69: !new pc
[5:06:33] Antiquasar: 250k
[5:06:37] Turaxyy: it's the game
[5:06:37] Rhivnn: Isnt it all about viewer numbers though? If it's not easy to watch and understand, there will never be an audience
[5:06:39] chimpules69: !newpc
[5:06:39] StreamElements: 14900k, 4080, MSI MPG Z790 EDGE WiFi DDR5, 32GB CORSAIR DOMINATOR TITANUM RGB DDR5 (2x16GB) 6000MT/s, 1200W SHIFT
[5:06:45] notmorbos: @Turaxyy not necessarily true, quite a few of my friends loved to watch it with me and some of them never even pvpd - mop/wod times that is
[5:06:46] pipebomblive: I remember watching the AWC my first time and the stream had over 200k in MoP
[5:06:54] pipebomblive: er, Blizzcon
[5:07:03] drsnugglemuppet: arena is like a mini game inside the game itself... not enough focus to arena from the start
[5:07:04] Xeckslol: The issue with WoW itself is how much game knowledge you need to have to understand all the little things the players do that sets them apart from normal players
[5:07:09] drsnugglemuppet: i dno if its too late
[5:07:15] junqueirao: We cant see resto druid in high level PvP stream!! Pls, play as resto druid for us!!! What The best partness for resto druid? War? Rogue? Lock? Hunter? Pally?
[5:07:22] hophell_pal: <3
[5:07:26] Rhivnn: @Xeckslol I think this is ttue
[5:07:36] pipebomblive: not really, the casters are really good at what they do
[5:07:40] hophell_pal: always interesting streams <3
[5:07:51] Xeckslol: And arena is also not a great spectator sport for casual players/people who don't play the game
[5:07:59] Grimey_George: There is just games that have stood the sands of time. WoW happens to be one of those games.  They could retail / classic era tournaments together. Kinda how super smash bros does Melee / Ultimate tournaments.
[5:08:01] pipebomblive: neither is league
[5:08:10] mrbigpizza: thank you for streamin my boy <3
[5:08:13] drsnugglemuppet: thats because arena generic ui is rubbish u cant play without addons
[5:08:16] pipebomblive: it's just the amount of time spent to build up the community of the game
[5:08:17] hophell_pal: <3
[5:08:33] Xeckslol: League and Dota heroes only have like 4 skills, so there is way less to keep track of
[5:08:36] Xeckslol: And way easier to watch
[5:08:37] NurfMe206: judge heals shinta a heck ton, right?
[5:08:46] kooolzin: the idea that league is easy to watch is pure copium to me, its because most of us have played and because they do a great job at explaining whats going on during the games
[5:08:47] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream and the content? Consider supporting by Subscribing or Donating! This is what I do full-time and any amount is greatly appreciated but not expected. Subscribers also don't receive any ads!
[5:08:47] drsnugglemuppet: his using slow red judge
[5:08:50] pipebomblive: but when plays happen you have no idea what happened in league
[5:08:58] NurfMe206: @drsnugglemuppet why this be, for this match up
[5:09:03] drsnugglemuppet: @faithfulqt amen ROFL
[5:09:19] pipebomblive: or WHY they were plays
[5:09:20] NurfMe206: @NurfMe206 on review, thats healing judge
[5:09:22] Xeckslol: You definitely have way more of an idea than WoW. There is so much spell graphic clutter in wow that you don't even see cooldowns being used (especially defensives)
[5:09:32] pipebomblive: that's just wrong LOL
[5:09:41] pipebomblive: there's so much in League too bro thats WHY I can't tell what happened
[5:09:43] kooolzin: watch a korean team teamfighting and tell me you can see everything that's going on
[5:09:45] kooolzin: that's pure copium
[5:09:46] uninspire: yeah like prewalling a kidney is impossible for a spectator to see, flashing a skillshot is easy to understand idk
[5:09:49] uninspire: ur huge cope
[5:10:03] Nerzz: lmao
[5:10:16] Xeckslol: Maybe YOU see it. But newer players wouldn't. Like I said, there are way less spells in MOBAs, so there are only so many things to look out for
[5:10:17] pipebomblive: @uninspire which is why the casters are really important because they relay that information in the moment and describe why it was important
[5:10:29] uninspire: ya but in league you dont need caster explanations for hype most of the time
[5:10:35] Xeckslol: Exactly
[5:10:43] pipebomblive: wrong
[5:10:46] uninspire: lol..
[5:10:54] drsnugglemuppet: well this new league mmo better be good
[5:10:54] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[5:11:06] uninspire: yeah show this wow arena to someone whos never seen wow, theyll know 0% of whats happening. someone whos never played league will understand basics
[5:11:11] pipebomblive: bro I've played league casually with friends, Arams mostly, and I couldn't tell you shit on why anything happens
[5:11:13] Tupacx: Doesnt League have like big cluster fuck fights which is bad as a spectator sport? Kinda like why Overwatch never popped off either
[5:11:18] pipebomblive: yes ^
[5:11:21] drsnugglemuppet: we are all in our thirties are we gona play mmos in our 40s too?
[5:11:25] Xeckslol: @uninspire explained it perfectly when he was talking about pre-walling pivotal stuns
[5:11:34] Xeckslol: How is a new player going to understand that he did that?
[5:11:34] pipebomblive: and I countered that point ^
[5:11:35] uninspire: so ur own fault is not the typical experience lmao, theres a reason league is more widely watched
[5:11:35] letho_og: @drsnugglemuppet ofc
[5:11:37] drsnugglemuppet: mobile fone games make more then wow
[5:11:38] Honasii: !newpc
[5:11:38] StreamElements: 14900k, 4080, MSI MPG Z790 EDGE WiFi DDR5, 32GB CORSAIR DOMINATOR TITANUM RGB DDR5 (2x16GB) 6000MT/s, 1200W SHIFT
[5:11:44] uninspire: u didnt counter u just said u cant understand anything
[5:11:47] uninspire: ur not typical lol
[5:11:54] Xeckslol: Even casters miss things because of how much is going on. You can't expect them to be able to follow EVERY spell that is cast from 6 players
[5:12:05] kooolzin: @uninspire ofc there is a reason, that reason is millions of dollars in investment
[5:12:10] uninspire: correct
[5:12:14] pipebomblive: @uninspire you're arguing about people who don't know what's going on and I say I'm someone who isn't active in league but more casual and you're telling me, who's the demographic you're arguing FOR, that I'm wrong
[5:12:20] drsnugglemuppet: its true though ive been playin wow for 15 years, i watched retail arena i dno wtf is goin on
[5:12:25] uninspire: faith ur just plain wrong amn im sorry
[5:12:31] letho_og: @drsnugglemuppet fax
[5:12:35] pipebomblive: feeling is extraordinarily mutual
[5:12:37] uninspire: listen to every1 else, its not every1 wrong, its you lol
[5:12:42] pipebomblive: 1 other person
[5:12:52] pipebomblive: while 3 others have said its a cluster fuck and they dont know whats going on
[5:12:52] CozyKhayla: yo whats going on i was making breakfast
[5:12:54] CozyKhayla: u ok chat
[5:13:03] uninspire: ok does any human in this chat think a single person would find wow easier to understand as a spectator than league?
[5:13:12] Xeckslol: I guarantee you that Pojke does so many little things that go over your head too, and you're just watching his stream
[5:13:15] pipebomblive: again, not following my point
[5:13:17] letho_og: they're actually having a respectful disagreement from what it seems
[5:13:22] uninspire: nobody agrees man
[5:13:23] Tupacx: From personal view yes, I dont understand anything of league at all
[5:13:29] kooolzin: nobody has ever said wow is easier to watch than league, the point is that league isn't easy to watch either and it is successful
[5:13:29] pipebomblive: there you go
[5:13:33] uninspire: he plays WoW
[5:13:36] pipebomblive: exactly @kooolzin
[5:13:39] uninspire: hes not a no experience person lmao
[5:13:39] xarlivenow: u gonna go in voice with shinta today
[5:13:40] Apocolipz1: Highest 2s rating in Wotlk?
[5:13:47] peongod: What do u enjoy to do when ur not playing wow?
[5:14:05] nayumixkaizen: @kooolzin nothing is easy to watch as a newbie most ppl from high divisions when they watch they understand whats going  on
[5:14:18] dromed_xd: dramaaa dramaaa
[5:14:29] kooolzin: @kooolzin 99% of league players aren't high division
[5:14:30] ExehnTV: Wrath is hard to follow even for someone who plays if, retail is a clusterfuck that's too hard and unwatchable for the average
[5:14:52] pipebomblive: my point was that the casters in WoW are better than league to the point when something does happen in the moment are very good at explaining to new players
[5:14:52] notmorbos: i dont need to understand anything, i need some korean yelling in my ear and everythings hype
[5:15:02] scopemeup: scopemeup subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[5:15:09] scopemeup: I heard I missed some drama???
[5:15:19] pipebomblive: so they can relatively keep up even not having played WoW or understanding. I've experienced this first hand with several friends IRL who've barely touched WoW
[5:15:29] scopemeup: hurley... he got his taps on everything
[5:15:29] ekeenm: it's not accessible as other games as well
[5:15:33] Xeckslol: WoW is mainly a PVE game, and even a lot of pve players find arena way too hard to even care about
[5:15:35] uninspire: ya idk im just echoing the massive majority man u can think what u want faith
[5:15:46] peongod: Tbf tho, if there was like a visual effect when u death blind or somethinig like that
[5:15:52] peongod: would prolly make it mor fun to watch
[5:15:58] pipebomblive: several people here have disagreed with you and you just want to be right but yeah, I'm done here too
[5:16:20] drsnugglemuppet: class balancing is SO POORLY done... its based on a pve system
[5:16:24] kooolzin: i dont think wow is easy to watch, but neither is league
[5:16:27] drsnugglemuppet: this is why it fucks arena
[5:16:28] uninspire: yes the unbiased wow streamer chat can understand wow, guarantee u cant get a similar answer in any other chat but gt gt
[5:16:29] mrbigpizza: I am actually surprised PvPer still get their seasonal mounts and shit
[5:16:33] kooolzin: blizzard has done everything in their power to make wow esports NOT successful
[5:16:34] pipebomblive: I feel like solo shuffle killed retail queues
[5:16:36] hjathemage: Hayaaaa

[5:17:10] kooolzin: lol
[5:17:12] damndanielsctv: gained any rating at all?
[5:17:15] mrbigpizza: He is back poggers
[5:17:16] drsnugglemuppet: the prize money is dogshit why would u bother haha
[5:17:21] BroyWonder: the mens himself BatChest
[5:17:25] uninspire: poj going for 4k today
[5:17:25] drsnugglemuppet: be the best in the world and not get rewarded
[5:17:29] drsnugglemuppet: thankgod for twitch i guess
[5:17:36] pipebomblive: @kooolzin as I mentioned earlier, sometime in Cata or MoP Blizzard came out and said they never wanted WoW to be an esport
[5:17:40] hjathemage: Giggling 🫠
[5:18:00] CozyKhayla: i only watch the league championships every year
[5:18:02] pipebomblive: and this conversation started with me saying imagine if they funneled the same amount of love into the AWC as they do the MDI or RWF
[5:18:02] nayumixkaizen: @faithfulqt or they said it as an excuse
[5:18:07] CozyKhayla: idk how to play that game KEKW
[5:18:08] scopemeup: no voice coms today @Minpojke ???
[5:18:11] drsnugglemuppet: pojke does have the best wow trophy in existance though....
[5:18:21] drsnugglemuppet: look at that fkn hammer
[5:18:27] pipebomblive: @nayumixlol idk, their actions have kept true to the statements. Especially with that prize pool fiasco in BFA
[5:18:37] damndanielsctv: Juicy

[5:21:45] pipebomblive: to let his warrior connect easier
[5:21:50] Nextrkw: only boot enchant
