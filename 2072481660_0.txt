[0:17:38] Joneim: classic
[0:17:38] Polowy: Im that andy
[0:17:54] moistcoconut62: ye
[0:17:56] nerefwow: we just meme on classic, that’s it
[0:17:59] Dzor12: I don't think about it or talk about it. That's weird
[0:18:04] bergy101: nah retail only players dont stfu about classic
[0:18:07] pretlacik: started play retail so much things to do LOVE IT wotlk bored to me nothing to do more

[0:18:11] holymommades: That's me, i played classic when it was the thing, why go back
[0:18:11] Riot_Blacktimus: honestly I blame Reddit for the way classic players are viewed in the community, classicwow reddit is a fucking cesspool

[0:18:31] iamthegodcomplex: As a classic player, I agree
[0:18:33] xxMaverick: you have to shit on a game you're not playing. it's a way to destress
[0:18:34] xsinker: I don't go out of my way to clown on classic but if someone asks which one they should try, then I might a little
[0:18:45] pretlacik: in retail is so much things to do just love it ... look good
[0:18:45] SaintDeath: I am a retail andy, and don't ever think about classic cause I already played through it when it was...vanilla.
[0:18:47] TheLuo: NGL I was suuuuuper team #nofkingchanges for classic...then never played it. So I just don't care anymore. Ppl have fun so that's good.
[0:18:55] baelsebub: i loved classic back in 2005. Been there done that tho
[0:19:00] AbieCherry: kushiSith BALD kushiSith BANDITS
[0:19:01] Mr_Mattnificent: The only issue with classic or retail is that they are not separated into their own categories on Twitch.
[0:19:14] klappe92: If you think about it, classic is just retail but later
[0:19:19] Riot_Blacktimus: end of S2 was a drag
[0:19:27] thatfriggindude: I started playing WoW during the end of classic. Why would I go back to things I have already beaten?
[0:19:29] spampurge: for a new player i'd recc classic for sure, but if ur a returning WoW player retail is aight
[0:19:29] Salfriel: who's the 3rd guy?

[0:23:00] Boreall: Balatro
[0:23:01] femboy_fan: Wait. Did Max ever stream without his hat on, or am I crazy from too many bans due to posting cocks? cmonBruh
[0:23:02] gunsman: balatro goated on the steam deck
[0:23:16] xxMaverick: @Richthofen187 i never got into poe cuz i'm too dumb for that. last epoc is definitely a good middle ground
[0:23:16] SurelyBaked: frick black rook hold
[0:23:23] daevyfan: @femboy_fan first time ever
[0:23:25] fleks27: blackrookhold has been mostly boring because most matches were onesided change my mind
[0:23:34] frki_: ask jb for brh lore maybe that changes your opinion
[0:23:36] spiritcheese: BLUBBERS i like BRH
[0:23:51] smolderdaddyuwu: @maximum could I buy Balatro on the switch?
[0:24:00] tazimage: whats the mandatory DHT tech
[0:24:07] Richthofen187: @xxMaverick ill look more into it then but having to buy it is definitely a turn off for me tbh
[0:24:19] BigTrout3: KEKW
[0:24:19] DekkerDE: bro these rules
[0:24:35] Ddemonee: Tettles hair different again KEKW

[0:25:01] dharmist_2: HAIRGATE111111
[0:25:04] panacer: MDI exists for cool tech. patch it after and let the speedrunners break it
[0:25:05] nekitamocika: Who said it, if its not bannable on life, u should be allowed to do it
[0:25:07] fleks27: it was the only hype thing about the tourney and infinite reach LMAO
[0:25:10] Sanctos304: ea sports had it right 30 years ago
[0:25:13] AbieCherry: PLAGUEBORES KEKW
[0:25:13] Joneim: baseg
[0:25:18] Saahf: yea cheating should be legal if its cool baseg
[0:25:22] Fortybelow: Agree with JB lol
[0:25:23] brodiebrohan: tournaments are never for the players. It’s for spectators.
[0:25:23] Chanmander: JB is spitting
[0:25:30] TheRealTarrjue: cheating is cool
[0:25:34] locokute: jb wouldve flipped his desk twice if he lost to plagueborers
[0:25:35] TheRealTarrjue: and totally legal
[0:25:37] MBG_95: no class stacking is boring
[0:25:45] SkrrtRussel: Susge then why does it need to be removed
[0:25:49] Fortism: Just have the mentality of an "Any%-speedrun"
[0:25:51] taanzfour: tripple outlaw peeking in on TOTT 30

[0:25:57] Astralix_WoW: jpc the man
[0:26:00] TheLuo: I mean I feel like double mage would have been tits in S1
[0:26:00] Groodf: man, whats up with JB today? woke up and decided today was the day for goated takes
[0:26:03] AbieCherry: @Maximum there's literally a 3 year old reddit thread saying watching cheese like plagueborer was the best mdi ever looked lol
[0:26:06] MasotaTV: is that jpc?
[0:26:12] smolderdaddyuwu: Yes
[0:26:41] fleks27: GIGACHAD admin
[0:26:43] TheRealTarrjue: the rule prevents niche 2 stacks that could be cool. Otherwise it doesn't matter for recent seasons.
[0:26:57] MBG_95: I bet JB would encourage a rule to force 1 tank 3 dps 1 healer
[0:26:57] Dengen88: is his stream freezing for anyone else?
[0:26:58] Polowy: tf, if I was developing a game that had 13 classes, i wouldnt want stacking either
[0:27:05] Fortism: WRONG! 👉
[0:27:10] Evcon_: "Haha idiot" - some admin.
[0:27:21] dashwinsta: I wish they had class picks/bans so ppl HAVE to use different comps.
[0:27:35] vaerlyn: @MBG_95 he's agressively campaigning for that already
[0:27:39] NykolasRage: I wouldn't watch if they class stacked. It's boring. Id rather see more diversity in classes.
[0:27:39] taanzfour: @dashwinsta way to much practice required for hte money
[0:27:40] Zingerac: class pick bans would be aggressively dogshit
[0:27:44] BigTrout3: calling mythic+ a mini-game makes it sound like mario party

[0:28:29] fleks27: muting healers is a must
[0:28:31] ncckna: Have matches even started today? ICANT
[0:28:33] MBG_95: but JB wants exactly the opposite? he wants Healer required but wants class stacking? thats also small brain
[0:28:35] Groodf: Ngl, JB giving some good takes today, very un-charactaristic
[0:28:35] dashwinsta: is JB drunk?
[0:28:37] Joneim: @nalikael JB is peak, dont be a weirdo
[0:28:38] Curryz_: bro ne never stops KEKW
[0:28:39] Nipe____: does this work on JB
[0:28:41] SurelyBaked: DID SOMEONE SAY 4 DPS?! Madge
[0:28:45] Dengara: Why not 1 tank 1 support 1 healer and 2 dps then?
[0:28:46] flurp__: GoodTake
[0:28:47] Joneim: xdd
[0:28:47] smolderdaddyuwu: @dashwinsta you're not?
[0:28:48] DannyBoii614: JB makes me embarrassed to be an over 30 wow player lmao we are not all like this

[0:29:08] testosteronald: 2 roles but you chose healer or tank
[0:29:09] scorgie1994: just act like JB's cutting out whenever he malds over 4dps
[0:29:11] kluckadoodle: But what about 5dps :)
[0:29:14] KeepinItSurreal: @Maximum Please tell JB that they should also require a support class then role diversity could be increased 100% in one go. Numbers go up so it's a good thing.
[0:29:14] Defyin: that gets maxs juice flowing hell yea waycrest

[1:06:50] SurelyBaked: bruh using corona in that context in a conversation is like level 9999 speech OMEGALUL
[1:06:51] logicaltty: it's a C because the corona is thicker on the left side
[1:06:51] Teeraen: The sun is skewed in the logo making the sun a C in the left side of the eclipse. It's barely noticeable.

[1:11:49] Thamarian: Most right handed people choose to go left
[1:11:50] ludosquoo: ig so KEKW
[1:12:05] Raggu2: Going clockwise is less total movement for an increase in difficulty. Going counter is less difficulty for more movement.
[1:12:11] slappadabas5: boss is a nightmare for elemental yeah

[1:13:13] holymommades: It cracks me up that they all play alliance races in MDI and horde the rest of the time
[1:13:14] Raggu2: Also you run the risk if you commite to clockwise movement that it just doesnt make a space sometimes in the orbs.
[1:13:15] knersh_: @guynormally worst trash spawn ever

[1:13:35] Shroomztm: @Nox1o it completely depends on how hard the rest of the team focuses on boss damage or aoe
[1:13:37] thestoong: pet the dog
[1:13:43] parrti_: shouldn't the timer be on Boss 3 as both team killed Boss 2
[1:13:47] Sharrubo: @TiPera they are both part of the new mega dungeon, thats why they look similar
[1:13:49] musziszi_: @beardlessdwarff but demonfire is in destro tree dmg spell and shadofury in warlock tree cc

[2:05:30] mateusz777: @Maximum  wait, isnt every question and answer public ?
[2:05:47] zzzDai: @meken You really want to snap DQ someone instead of taking their time, discuss it and make sure, and then DQ them?
[2:05:47] Firenze32: Imagine if they just cancel the run and dq and later find out it was unjustified
[2:05:49] tempestyn: theres no way you just DQ them instantly without talking about it lmao
[2:05:50] nevotheless: the intermission was way too long they debated the dq for a long time though
[2:05:50] TheJamesDash: @maximum looool as someone who has worked behind the scenes in esports for the last decade. Whomever is talking is giving way too much credit to forethought of esports events

[2:06:29] meken: @zzzDai do you think it takes the entire dungeon to realize they did something banned? it's a pull on the first boss

[3:12:10] kuromebro: 25 min cd on ashen
[3:12:11] TheunGaming: cooldowns should probably be strong but need to be on longer CDs
[3:12:13] jannekvarnc: the most fun healing would be like pvp healing but in m+, where you gotta minmax your heal globals constantly and sometimes put out dam bursts, but that would be probably raise the skill floor pretty significantly
[3:12:14] GodKingMuninn: If button fun to hit, button good.
[3:12:14] Wolfdaddy: Ashen should've been 3 mins
[3:12:17] Heavydk: Would be cool with more classes that has "ultimate abilities" with giga long cds but super strong
[3:12:20] Esotraz: Dont give them ashen
[3:12:22] SomefinWicked: @sloppiione  that's what I just said, it's not implemented, they can add items to the game with no way to get them (look at the glasses that just became available in 10.2.5 that were added in cata)
[3:12:25] Gobbomb: Ashen weaker on 3 min cd
[3:12:29] x_Scy: ducks missing count?
[3:12:30] auby6: if people already want the game to be pruned, then healers aint getting dmg like they had n shadowlands
[3:12:31] paper_rose: @Maximum are there actually any worthwhile 4 min cds?
[3:12:34] captainnetz: Healer taking extra cooldowns in their talent tree is literally the problem lol
[3:12:48] x_Scy: nvm
[3:12:49] SomefinWicked: @x_Scy ducks missing count when at 100%, classic
[3:13:00] Kyocere: 1-2 min cds feel so much better in m+

[4:23:38] timmayb166: these convos were not happening last week kinda shows this cup has been trash
[4:23:38] kj01a: Buts very much an MMO in the way that retail is not anymore.
[4:23:42] nerefwow: BBoomer
[4:23:42] flurp__: HOLY BOOMER
[4:23:44] cassiahh: game 3 hype
[4:23:49] RazaDazza: getting gear for raids takes hundreds of hours to grind for hundreds of hours to get the gear from raids to grind hundreds of hours of other bosses for hundreds of hours @maximum
[4:23:50] Swinkyy7: bro i've been playing runescape for over 20 years and i have no idea what JPC is saying
[4:23:50] amazadin: in OSRS the journey is the destination
[4:23:51] Critmaw: Mu was the bomb
[4:23:52] ampliDude7: BBoomer ultimate online
[4:23:55] GabeJpp: Hell yeah mu!
[4:23:56] Baerhug_: love mu online
[4:23:57] jerkmcgee: jb got out boomered
[4:23:58] splashz0r: mu Pog
[4:23:59] fatescursed: Asheron's Call ftw
[4:24:03] Gobbomb: @Critmaw Rs3 has much much faster xp rates and generally can max in like a tenth the time of osrs
[4:24:03] Icy_Tree: MU was sick
[4:24:04] Sinergy_57: Think we lost max
[4:24:04] kj01a: Any y'all ever play ski free?
[4:24:04] kibaha: mu online sheeesh

[4:24:09] vhev1g: holyyy, Xyro with the classics
[4:24:09] MrOldero: Anarchy Online !
[4:24:10] maddershunt: kal online
[4:24:10] Defyin: rs3 is better if you ignore mtx but nostalgia baits people hard
[4:24:11] Nikeisha: elephant mud
[4:24:12] zuchii1: MU ONLINE BEST GAME EVER MADE
[4:24:12] flurp__: My god JB is old
[4:24:12] Icy_Tree: its just super buggy
[4:24:13] elsupergaga: any oregon trail enjoyers in chat ?
[4:24:14] Aranaevens: Metin enjoyer somewhere ?
[4:24:22] The_Frix: GM is 10x harder than HoF
[4:24:23] xDevDev: true
[4:24:26] Boreall: Warframe devs also dunk
[4:24:27] quarantedeux: wait is jb actually a dinosaur ?!
[4:24:34] Gobbomb: OSRS* devs
[4:24:42] lontaku: metin ALOO
[4:24:42] elliVVille: they're at the mercy of the players, of course we think they're great
[4:24:42] RazaDazza: Mod Ash GIGACHAD
[4:24:45] Nox1o: probably works way better if the community is that hold
[4:24:45] captainnetz: YES
[4:24:47] Boreall: He's not wrong though, OSRS devs are crazy transparent
[4:24:48] Nox1o: old*
[4:24:49] Hxwkins: yes thats rs3
[4:24:49] SurelyBaked: yeah the main reason OSRS was able to survive was because of the dev's responsiveness tbh
[4:24:55] Joneim: They needed to get goodwill back
[4:24:55] Ancine: ease to be a good dev when ur game is shit but still attracts players
[4:24:55] Gobbomb: RS3 devs are stuck with whatever hedgefund owns jagex atm
[4:24:56] Hxwkins: rs3 is exactly what everyone was mad about
[4:24:57] stando96_: @maddershunt Amen
[4:24:57] dumnerd: they literally almost killed their company by not doing it
[4:24:59] greener_73: they did it BECAUSE people were super mad about their changes
[4:24:59] xDevDev: yes the whole point of OSRS was to be community driven
[4:24:59] Rampo123: KEKW
[4:25:00] Sinergy_57: RS3 happened
[4:25:00] VariusVeritas: they had to make osrs because they fucked up so bad
[4:25:01] Boreall: @Maximum it's because 90% of changes that get made in the game are player voted
[4:25:06] Critmaw: @Gobbomb I've been thinking real hard about giving RS a shot. Might try out RS3
[4:25:08] greentechx: Like D4
[4:25:13] gascen: That's why OSRS was created initially
[4:25:14] captainnetz: Max, they were super not transparent and the game was in super downturn until one guy was transparent and game went back up as a result
[4:25:21] SurelyBaked: the fact OSRS was even a thing was a massive play, which is why people compare FF14 being redone to OSRS
[4:25:26] wobble_tv: when they released osrs to mobile devices the business model changed
[4:25:27] SurelyBaked: Aware 2007
[4:25:29] stando96_: @maddershunt full g56 archer
[4:25:30] greentechx: but they dont listen but say they do heh
[4:25:36] MaliciousDH: bad decisions like making rs3
[4:25:38] cixxay: @Critmaw If you play rs3 playing ironman is highly highly highly reccomended
[4:25:51] theDirtyon3: HOLY Xyro Lore
[4:25:58] SurelyBaked: jagex was too busy trying to chase blizzard that they literally sabotaged their own game and then released the old game again and saved it
[4:25:59] Critmaw: @cixxay Is ironman like non-trading? Why is that recommended?
[4:26:16] Boreall: SoD is still Vanilla
[4:26:17] theDirtyon3: SoD is great dont let James fool you
[4:26:22] TJKlaenn: SoD is lit
[4:26:23] RobbieFire: sod is why i play wow
[4:26:23] humblefred: sod is so fun what
[4:26:26] spiritcheese: xdd
[4:26:26] maddershunt: @stando96_ going sin in the starting zone and getting chased half way around the world
[4:26:28] Jumanjiqt: SoD is hot trash
[4:26:28] Benjg7: SoD is good
[4:26:29] justdavesadly: sod is a BANGER
[4:26:30] remli1991: enshrouded is doing the same they let the community vote on what they should add next and the things are only community ideas
[4:26:30] cixxay: @Critmaw RS3 progression is just unenjoyable as a player who can trade, the game is fast enough to make ironman the best
[4:26:31] SurelyBaked: Classic OMEGALUL
[4:26:32] MuffinCookie01: sod is lit indeed
[4:26:35] tobbs94: sod is awesome
[4:26:36] Swinkyy7: yea Jagex actually makes new content for the old game
[4:26:37] RazaDazza: sod does suck
[4:26:38] thereal_LG: it lets me enjoy classic without the insane time req. for lvl 60 end game
[4:26:38] elliVVille: aggrend is the goat
[4:26:42] Bajablastoislol: sod is great
[4:26:42] Boreall: SoD is definitely just cope
[4:26:42] tigerslap_ow: one thing I like about sod, is when you buff people, they buff you back
[4:26:43] SriveMyDoul: mod ash
[4:26:43] Wafzig: SOD devs are goated
[4:26:44] genovis1: phases feel good since you can take pretty nice breaks
[4:26:45] MaliciousDH: tarkov is the best mmo
[4:26:48] guynormally: SoD is just reskinned WotLK
[4:26:48] Sjintao: the dev in question is the worst pisslow casual tho
[4:26:56] louetv: chasing updates in tweet replys is so fucking fun
[4:26:58] MrTenebret: Aggrend is the best thing to happen to WoW in a while. He actually communicates changes. It's amazing
[4:27:00] Critmaw: @cixxay Is there a good amount of player population in ironman?
[4:27:00] fizzis_: SoD devs are 100% better than retail if they are different. We need SoD devs for retail
[4:27:03] stando96_: @maddershunt death run doggebi's in front of d1 to that main city and kill those lvl 20 ppl and they lose exp lol
[4:27:05] SlowboLaggins: sod sucks unless you have friends to mess around with
[4:27:08] theDirtyon3: HUH
[4:27:09] Nox1o: isnt that all of sod though?
[4:27:10] Boreall: Taking 15-20 gameplay hours to go from 25-40 is just horrendous
[4:27:15] cixxay: @Critmaw Yeah pretty much everyone plays ironman in endgame RS3
[4:27:20] ctg_dreamz: anyone playing SoD is a casual wtf
[4:27:21] fleks27: the sod devs arent giga elite but they turbo own with communication
[4:27:23] thereal_LG: nah retail is for try harding, classic should be more " fun"
[4:27:24] venyalorelei: Aggrend windmull dunks on previous devs with his communication. And it's note ven close
[4:27:26] reggiepowa: mike ybarra should make retail wow
[4:27:27] Sjintao: It is a problem when the dev in question removes every sweat/fun aspect of the journey
[4:27:28] Nox1o: 50 year old dad
[4:27:29] SurelyBaked: chat forgets that the MAJORITY of gamers are casuals
[4:27:29] MaliciousDH: i like how noone is even watching the match
[4:27:30] nightst314: uber-dads
[4:27:42] ThreesFG: SoD is when you took a ton of edibles and still want to game
[4:27:42] elliVVille: if you shit talk aggrend we're fighting square up
[4:27:42] RazaDazza: they’re JBs
[4:27:42] Critmaw: @cixxay cool, I think I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the advice bro
[4:27:45] Aemon__: if a dev is good at their game, they arent devving enough
[4:27:46] Wafzig: You don't want sweaty people designing classic.  The sweaties are toxic and annoying
[4:27:48] knersh_: elitism is so dumb
[4:27:48] kj01a: If a dev took the time to be a Good Player (tm), they'd be a terrible developer
[4:27:48] gormlessgordon: classic wow players cant look in the mirror
[4:27:49] djdragTv: did they allow to pull dryad tru wall ?
[4:27:53] Lunamhm: I think you need people on the team that are good, obivously all of them do not need to be super good
[4:27:54] wraghelm: For people to be insanely hardcore they need to do it for a living MOST of the time
[4:27:54] antipheonixna: mortdog got challenger in tft one time said it was when he was the worst dev
[4:27:58] SlowboLaggins: @thereal_LG in theory but in reality theres a lot more people sweating on classic lol
[4:28:05] Boreall: OSRS raids giga blow
[4:28:09] xDevDev: theyre improving pvm for sure
[4:28:10] Kochthesecondcoming: piss low casuals are the majoritylol
[4:28:17] MrChaCho: I don't play osrs, but i constantly hear from friends that do that the polls often strike down good shit because some youtuber doesn't like it and it gets brigaded.
[4:28:21] RazaDazza: OSRS raids should be soloable
[4:28:22] Scoops__: the wildstar raids looked so cool
[4:28:22] MaliciousDH: wildstar had amazing raids
[4:28:23] CorwenTTV: RIP WildStar
[4:28:24] Joneim: Problem with RS is thr obsession with making them soloable
[4:28:25] SurelyBaked: baseg wildstar
[4:28:26] werttit: the tick system in osrs just can't support good mechanics imo
[4:28:26] Covlol: Wildstar had so much potential :(
[4:28:30] vitaax13: ffxiv
[4:28:32] skeetic: it's in classic wow, of course the mechanics are meh
[4:28:33] prinqless: rift???
[4:28:33] justdavesadly: I am Hoping the Riot MMO is at least close to it.
[4:28:35] gloop1: rift was sick
[4:28:35] ponez: rip wildstar salute
[4:28:35] Moonrake: Several devs  from WildStar ending up working at Blizzard after it shut down
[4:28:36] prinqless: dude rift was epic
[4:28:37] wraghelm: Destiny raids
[4:28:37] PinkTaricFTW: FF14?
[4:28:37] ItHatWhat: rift
[4:28:39] Saahf: baseg
[4:28:39] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Rift Sadge
[4:28:40] Shakenbaked: ye Rift was insane, really nice
[4:28:41] fizzis_: Rift was probably the closest
[4:28:41] Boreall: @MrChaCho I wouldn't say often, it happens once in a while
[4:28:41] Swinkyy7: yea Rift was amazing for a little bit
[4:28:42] SurelyBaked: i enjoy destiny's raids ngl
[4:28:43] ampliDude7: wildstar literally died because it tried to be too hardcore like wow Sadge
[4:28:43] highcard2: rift was cool
[4:28:44] GodKingMuninn: Aggrenned is weird (the twitter dev for SoD) he very much has a 'spirit of classic' attitude, yet will not fix things in SoD that are objectively bad and only there because 'spirit of classic'
[4:28:44] emorej69: @RazaDazza they have all been soloed
[4:28:46] RetTV: GA Kreygasm
[4:28:47] MaliciousDH: for small team raiding, Destiny does it well
[4:28:47] therealfishstix: you think wildstar survives if they didn't try to revive 40m raiding?
[4:28:48] flurp__: What did they do wrong? @Maximum
[4:28:48] RazaDazza: @mrchacho nah, they just target pvp updates like that
[4:28:49] arzibi: rift was great
[4:28:50] fizzis_: rift was insane
[4:28:51] rudejerk: except rift's raids were bugged to hell and they just didn't care to fix it for months
[4:28:52] mezzery_: rift was really fun
[4:28:54] fizzis_: nop[e
[4:28:55] AqB_Live: xiv is not even compareable guys xD
[4:28:55] Tambutroll: gw2?
[4:28:56] sethomatic: did you play wildstar?
[4:28:57] gloop1: Rift had the dopest talent tree system ever made
[4:28:58] mozerra: peepoSad long long time ago
[4:29:00] Swinkyy7: you can still play it but no one does
[4:29:00] theDirtyon3: PauseChamp
[4:29:01] CorwenTTV: WildStar combat is still  the best MMO combat to date
[4:29:02] cixxay: RS3 endgame pvm is actual insanely difficult and super underappreciated, like 300+apm for 20+minutes straight
[4:29:02] Shakenbaked: if u played Rift you'd get more WF's than echo by now, surely
[4:29:03] キマロド: rift was fun until they dumpstered it
[4:29:04] Thamarian: Rift was always free to play
[4:29:10] みょせつ: rift launch was INSANELY good but F2p ruined it big time
[4:29:17] Thamarian: Wildstar was the one that was the closest to wow raids
[4:29:17] MamiAlex: will it be a RWF for S4?
[4:29:26] justdavesadly: @MamiAlex No
[4:29:26] wraghelm: Max you should play one of those private servers of WoW where you can make your own class
[4:29:28] metel7: @MamiAlex n0
[4:29:28] WowGrandma78: I played rift then people left
[4:29:29] flurp__: If wildstar raids were so good what went wrong??
[4:29:31] jakundai27: do we know if s4 pool will be just dragonflight dungeons yet?
[4:29:34] muffe100: I feel like wow PvE just clears all other mmo's PvE
[4:29:34] sorliee: RIFT is super dead tho. Check its steamcharts lol
[4:29:34] RazaDazza: @emorej69 yeah but cox takes 35+ minutes if you’re not a giga sweat and tob is not soloable for a normal human
[4:29:36] nudlerx: chat is this the last series of the day?
[4:29:43] fatescursed: feel like rift stole the dual class idea from RoM
[4:29:47] Surrillian: @maximum did you ever play Swtor? that game bangs with the story and raids were fun for a full on bit
[4:29:51] Thamarian: @flurp__ Thats all they had. The rest of the game was pretty bad
[4:29:54] fizzis_: like when i wasnt playing wow or subbed, i was playing rift. it was that close
[4:29:54] sednajoan: loved my time in rift...
[4:29:54] RazaDazza: @emorej69 they should all be scalable like toa
[4:29:59] genovis1: @wraghelm its against wow TOS so i doubt he will do it, blizz would ban for it
[4:30:00] jasonhamlin: bard in rift was super fun
[4:30:09] MrChaCho: @Boreall Could be survivorship bias. Since I don't play, I only end up hearing when polls go to shit.
[4:30:09] nalikael: did Sloth buy the name ?
[4:30:11] BLACKFOOT_TN: Piss low = Civilians. Civilians are the subscription base that allows giga chad gamers have a game to play. Giga chad gamers are such a tiny minority but also very vocal. But it's the Civilians who are the ones devs need to keep in the game or the game goes bust.
[4:30:17] cixxay: any PVME spreadsheeters in the chat?
[4:30:22] tobbs94: fitting name then
[4:30:23] ampliDude7: @flurp__ they were too difficult for the majority of players and end game had little else too offer, so a lot of people just ended up having no content
[4:30:44] duhworks: @flurp__  was super hard and long to reach max level and was very try hard
[4:30:49] Raisha_Delos: wern't people giga degenerate with their sleep though?
[4:30:53] PinkTaricFTW: MDI just needs higher prize pool
[4:30:53] Nox1o: then people would practice on retail but just in scuffed
[4:30:55] Thowarr: @ampliDude7 So they based an entire game around WoD
[4:31:00] OldManBel: Idk i've been having fun fucking around on FFXIV inbetween seasons

[4:31:53] nekitamocika: Someone said yesterday that Sloth all have new jobs and dont have time to practice, also that Spanish WoW scene is kinda dead
[4:31:53] Rhop: That's some white beast energy
[4:31:58] Selphious: need youngewr and fresh hungry for win blood
[4:32:01] Sjintao: @BLACKFOOT_TN agreed with all this but game devs should learn to ignore the civilian and their casual takes and not change the game around what they want
[4:32:04] MrChaCho: Make the MDI a hell hole and make the affixs a slot roll right before they start. Can't practice strats and just the gamiest gamers win.
[4:32:05] Defyin: need youngewr and fresh hungry for win blood

[4:40:27] knersh_: JPC WITH THE HARD HITTING FACTS
[4:40:32] Defyin: yea boomer
[4:40:34] Nox1o: we say that every tournament. "This is the time Echo wont win"
[4:40:59] taanzfour: what
[4:40:59] zipline321: bro what
[4:40:59] azusve: whats the difference between "effective DPS" and "DPS"? is effective dps only counting uptime? like Recound does?
[4:41:04] Hoshma46: This is the time Echo wont win xdd
[4:41:05] fleks27: people said that on the mandatory mdi where it was close
[4:41:06] BigRedBTW: i've said it
[4:41:07] swagggle: Echo isn't winning this weekend
[4:41:08] nalikael: This is probably the 1st time Echo can actually not win
[4:41:09] kj01a: This is the time Echo wont win!
[4:41:09] OldManBel: Why do people hate on echo so much. They are a good team
[4:41:10] fleks27: lots of people expected a echo L
[4:41:11] CommonJD: Who is gaslighting who?
[4:41:11] auby6: we say it in our dreams
[4:41:23] JohntheBarbarian: Bros arguing with ghosts
[4:41:25] nayrcraig: Bro, he's your mod
[4:41:26] Kyocere: echo has no shot against bone buds, calling it now
[4:41:27] ribosomes322: "echo could lose" is just a way of making conversation because odds are - they'll win
[4:41:28] ToxicLG: Echo fans gotta feel like they are cheering for an underdog OMEGALUL
[4:41:30] Jirofanboy: ??????
[4:41:34] zipline321: bro arguing with himself
[4:41:38] nekitamocika: 49ers were betting favourites xdd
[4:41:42] highcard2: blame dextus
[4:41:45] miraagex: @azusve no idea, but probably details dps = overall dps / total dungeon time, while effective dps = overall dps / total time in combat
[4:41:47] nerefwow: GoodTake
[4:41:48] Cheveyooo: 49ers were echo this year, and imagine echo losing.... lmao
[4:41:49] poppapump: echo is equivalent to the Detroit lions
[4:41:49] Thamarian: There is always a chance for anyone to lose
[4:41:51] fleks27: on day 2 in sl mdi lots of people favored mandatory
[4:41:51] Cower311: ppl saying that echo might lose this one is their way of saying they want them to lose
[4:41:54] ladden: i dont think echo win this group
[4:41:55] fleks27: echo had a weak day 2 there
[4:42:00] Sepiyat: That's how most teams in most sports hype themselves up
[4:42:05] Wafzig: It's the guy on Twitter saying "I Though they said Seth Curry couldn't shoot??"
[4:42:09] KewTroll: @OldManBel Because they are winning so much. Similar to people hating Max Verstappen and Redbull for beating everyone completely
[4:42:13] BigRedBTW: @fleks27 i also had a weak day 2 whenever that was and whatever it was for
[4:42:20] Hoshma46: people didnt think the chiefs were even gonna make it to the super bowl this year early in the season
[4:42:23] Karping: so sad if eclipe dont go to the global
[4:42:27] kj01a: do you think Bone Buds name was inspired by Bonebaby?
[4:42:31] Nox1o: mandatory not looking like a 1st seed atm
[4:42:34] Kyocere: no bone buds votes, what a shame
[4:42:42] Joneim: xdd
[4:42:47] taanzfour: 1st Seed
[4:42:51] MrGharr: wait what
[4:43:00] BigRedBTW: yeah those casters probably play ranged dps
[4:43:01] Korentice: i called bald bandits being a sleeper. ez call
[4:43:05] Cower311: did casters even know that bald bandits were made up of a dream team of gamrs
[4:43:10] vente97: dratnos got the tooth debuff affecting his judgement
[4:43:26] Thamarian: Move yourself
[4:43:29] MakzzTV: pointless to do 2 cups when theres only 8 relevant teams
[4:43:31] BigRedBTW: is one of the requirements to join bald bandits to shave your head
[4:43:32] Sepiyat: In predictions, history trumps recency bias
[4:43:37] Jesdawow: whats the story on dratnos tooth, is he doing like a pirate cosplay?
[4:43:37] Nox1o: @vente97 isnt that fixed by now? that was weeks ago or?
[4:43:44] fleks27: slioth was good enough to throw stuff off back with more weak teams, but with only 2 cups you can see the diffy imo
[4:44:05] vente97: @Nox1o old one is out, gonna take a month before new one is fully in
[4:44:13] jitsuttv: This is Yalnu
[4:44:31] Villalobos11: Why is growl not competing?

[4:46:38] Cower311: @auby6 he was you just cant see it
[4:46:47] taanzfour: tgp
[4:46:50] caveman2x: TGP > MDI
[4:46:52] Marsbar006: I agree with JB tbh
[4:46:52] taanzfour: relatable, thats it
[4:46:54] gretriku: TGP 10000% more fun than MDI
[4:46:58] iamsmurffyou: TGP is always more interesting
[4:46:58] buzwiteyer: disagree
[4:47:01] PersianWOW: tgp is so boring
[4:47:02] auby6: @Cower311 the john cena brick
[4:47:10] sLr_____: nah speed is cooler. But yeah, it's true
[4:47:13] Xaern: everyone wants to see the limit
[4:47:13] kj01a: what I do this pugs all the time
[4:47:14] spudink: its relatable because everyone tries to kill a new raid boss
[4:47:15] Hoshma46: max's guild is xdd
[4:47:18] Kyocere: mdi > tgp, no doubt. tgp is boring af
[4:47:20] nekitamocika: Actual JB good take
[4:47:21] meak3st: i have CE im same as Liquid YEP relatable
[4:47:21] SkunkTruck: I am still raiding tho
[4:47:27] Thamarian: TGP is a better format. MDI is still fun to watch to see how fast people can go
[4:47:29] Nox1o: he is kinda right
[4:47:31] buzwiteyer: everyone is doing that shit though, just not day one?
[4:47:31] Joneim: JB is spitting
[4:47:32] goranves: I prefer MDI
[4:47:32] HoodsUpGaming: bad take imo
[4:47:32] caveman2x: GoodTake
[4:47:33] taanzfour: jbs not cooking
[4:47:34] MasotaTV: ok ngl sometimes jb has good takes
[4:47:36] Arantog: he is based
[4:47:37] gotelto: tgp > mdi !!!!!!!
[4:47:38] despacito_hater: Jb cookin
[4:47:39] RazaDazza: that take is shit. we all prog raid
[4:47:42] DylanWRX: not everything has to be homogenous
[4:47:44] eazye503: JB kind of has ICE COLD TAKES lately
[4:47:45] nayrcraig: It's also literally not the same boss a lot
[4:47:48] Nox1o: tgp just has perma content and perma potential wipes
[4:47:51] boxytt: that's definitely not true. People look at strats,  comps, etc from race
[4:47:51] vente97: just cause heroic pugs are harder than mythic doesn't mean we can't watch the race
[4:47:55] HoodsUpGaming: race to world first is cool because the community is seeing thse bosses for the first time at this difficulty @Maximum
[4:47:58] daddyfrankee: daddyfrankee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[4:47:59] Kyocere: tgp is the same comps and same pulls every time always and forever. its a yawn fest
[4:47:59] Hylotras: i want to see stuff i cannot do, things i do just with other numbers is kinda boring (TGP)
[4:48:04] OXDOX: Idgaf about relatability i want to see teams perfectly smash a dungeon in one go
[4:48:05] despacito_hater: people love watching things they can't do it's like the olympics
[4:48:08] preev0luti0n: whats more relatable to a casual than wiping to a boss?
[4:48:10] erdls: these mdi pulls arentl relatable to anyone either
[4:48:11] tooonfish: rare JB good take
[4:48:16] bayazijr: JB always sound so mad though lol
[4:48:21] kj01a: You can do 3 second seeds, if you believe in yourself SeemsGood
[4:48:22] Thamarian: TGP has a ceiling
[4:48:22] ludosquoo: actually true tho
[4:48:24] holymommades: I don't know that anyone live could pull off the Echo strat in Rise
[4:48:24] simo7466: Butr of they gonna do MDI they better not tell them so much stuff the cant do, the fun pars is the speed running of it
[4:48:26] goranves: Watching them spam re run a key after wiping 10 times is boring af
[4:48:26] omgitssepe: i can't watch professional sports because it's not relatable 4Head
[4:48:30] Kamedosin: Speed running is better content
[4:48:32] justdavesadly: bro i dont even play the game and i watch the race and tgp. Only reason i am seeing MDI is cause you are co streaming it @Maximum
[4:48:40] Cower311: @bayazijr thats just classic dad voice
[4:48:43] MullbertXD: why is he saying "the tgp"??? the the great push??
[4:48:45] ludosquoo: but then u only watch echo
[4:48:50] tiyandh: JB’s persona is his grumpiness
[4:48:54] Nox1o: saturday was giga good content with their brackenhide though
[4:48:55] ithels: I hate the mdi compared to tgp for the sole reason of pugs and people thinking that's how ur supposed to do the runs which isn't the case for pugs
[4:48:56] Thamarian: @holymommades Mandatory did it yesterday
[4:48:57] bubbles105: I loved tgp echo was insane
[4:49:03] Nox1o: everyone flipping out. same as plagueborer
[4:49:15] auby6: shit to heavy to get up from chair sad
[4:49:17] Samaraner: I still liked watching it, didnt matter echo winning was locked in early
[4:49:21] BullDevil: The only thing worth watching this MDI was seeing Echo get out dps'd with a 4 dps comp to another team's 3 dps comp
[4:49:31] KewTroll: I loved watching MDI and how wild some strats go. MDI single handedly made me love Azure Vaults
[4:49:38] vente97: the na maths by the casters and the co stream was entertaining too
[4:49:39] dendebr: Last TGP when growl was sheeting about echos  bracken tec was top tier content!
[4:49:40] Phatori: MDI > TGP I don’t want relatable. I just want to watch the best ppl in the world do huge as mega pulls that I know I can’t do and won’t see
[4:49:41] holymommades: @Thamarian yeah I'm talking live keys
[4:49:45] kj01a: wtf I missed the digimon conversation?! Jebaited
[4:49:54] Cheezeits11: talking about water
[4:49:54] Cower311: in tgp echo gaps teams even harder than mdi tho. they won tgp on like day 2 or some shit last time and we were just watching to root for last hope to get 2nd
[4:50:25] Thamarian: @holymommades Noones even gonna bother with it. To much setup and learning
[4:50:45] Estehr: maybe some edited videos like “road to mdi”?
[4:50:55] holymommades: yeah that's why watching this is so cool
[4:50:55] Khobahi: @Maximum think a better format would be. dont get dungeons/affix until shit starts.. then give them 1-2 hours in a dungeon to cook. fastest time wins
[4:50:59] BanjoSilk: i would have loved to see echo practice that snapping, specifically how funny the mess ups were
[4:50:59] Zilvaan: A major part of watchin gpush keys on streams is also listening to the coms though - something that is not possible in tgp
[4:51:14] scope_elite_: more practice= higher quality game play ?
[4:51:17] Samaraner: so we need TGP with unanounced dungeons
[4:51:24] nekitamocika: Mandatory DHT PepeLaugh
[4:51:25] daiger5o: BONE BUDS TATOO HERE WE GO
[4:51:30] Seepferd1982: why is throne 24 wtf?
[4:51:32] Nox1o: what if they make the group stage for mdi old m+ dungeons in tgp style tournament for fastest time
[4:51:42] nekitamocika: Mandatory had scuffed rise
[4:51:44] SILMAMIES: BONE BUDSSS
[4:51:46] AqB_Live: bone buds & harmony
[4:51:51] Nox1o: and then we see cooks in global finals, no strat copies possible
[4:51:53] Sinergy_57: Yeah no way they win right Max so tattoo time
[4:52:03] Cower311: inc mandatory dq
[4:52:11] Cower311: is this the first time we have seen mandatory DHT since the dq
[4:52:22] Reznr: I feel like MDI just needs a much larger map pool
[4:52:36] LucasSterling_: can you move ur cursor max
[4:52:38] AuxiliusTV: @Cower311 nah, we saw it earlier today
[4:52:45] poopstain221: Well it was nice playing with you all. Last Epoch has lost another active player due to server incompetence. Don't take me the wrong way, you guys have something great going on here. It is just unfortunate that you can't fix the constant crashes on Online Play. At the end of the day I am at least glad this happened before I donated the $1000 I put aside to support this project. Oh well shit happens and life is not fair, cheers to all of you guys on Last Epoch and thanks for the cheese
[4:52:53] nerefwow: Chatting
[4:53:07] Raisha_Delos: Chatting
[4:53:08] ludosquoo: what i like about the higher keys also is that there's risk and more deaths unlike this where its just perfection most of the time
[4:53:12] nekitamocika: what are bone buds doing
[4:53:15] SILMAMIES: its joever
[4:53:18] Nox1o: bone buds wiht the weekly route

[4:58:59] fizzis_: the fact that dk hero talents put MORE emphasis on DnD is not a good sign for TWW
[4:59:15] Dberjerak823: Make a kiss/curse affix where you have to /kiss a teammate or you get a curse :)
[4:59:22] Arantog: I actually don't think we will see ww rework ever because there is no dev
[4:59:25] MakzzTV: the 2 guys working on season 4 for sure will revamp the affix system
[4:59:33] Frozty76: @Maximum Do we know the Season 4 dungeons yet? Are they planning on just doing 8 DF dungeons?
[4:59:57] nudlerx: @Frozty76 yes

[5:01:00] Varthar: df
[5:01:06] Hopefulx: shouldnt need to play safe big io if youre a contender to win
[5:01:11] Thamarian: Fated should get all of the season 1 -3 dungeons

[5:19:50] Team_Spanky: @Maximum Just a guess here, but Dratnos looks like the kind of person who smells good. Not in an over cologne way... just fresh... Like just showered with a modestly scented soap

[6:02:21] holdenwook: Kungen is living in the past, but he is such a goddam legend he sort of just gets a pass
[6:02:22] SILMAMIES: those hardcore death compilations were the best. Everytime kungen came up you knew it was going to be lit
[6:02:26] bigmeanbeefy: @guynormally So just like retail m+ where dps should wait atleast 2 globas after the tank pulls before using hard hitting abilites?

[6:05:33] Gobbomb: Why the fuck
[6:05:35] Sathyron: what really????
[6:05:37] nerefwow: RNG during MDI KEKW
[6:05:52] Thamarian: Going through the door changes your spawn point
[6:05:56] Thamarian: Thats why he jumped
[6:06:02] St0rmbr3ak3r: so I'm not crazy for thinking it takes longer sometimes. Good to know
[6:06:04] KDaily: is there a reason not to summon the priest?
[6:06:06] MrChaCho: I'm just chilling in BRH and I can not for the life of me figure out how they climb these walls for the skip
[6:06:12] auby6: and its clearly a mistake
[6:06:16] nerefwow: @KDaily he can release after they take the portal
[6:06:20] dango0n: rise is ass
[6:06:21] vente97: WoW story KEKW
[6:06:22] Churchtrill: DoTi as a 5 man raid on weekly lockout would be cooler than adding it to M+ pool
[6:06:23] gooseleee: chat is this the last match of the night?
[6:06:30] Zingerac: I don't think streets and gambit are they way
[6:06:31] gretriku: @gooseleee ye

[6:06:43] bollhoj: Nokhud m+ YEP
[6:06:45] yifors: tazavesh was pog tho
[6:06:53] CMTerp: I never play these before they become M+
[6:06:54] ruediruempel: yeah and that mega dungeon is done one time LUL
[6:06:56] TheAwesomePeter: this was supposed to be a mini raid, not a m+ dg
[6:06:57] OJ_MasterJuice: worked well with taza tbf
[6:07:00] auby6: scrap the mega dungeons, and give me 1 new dungeon per season
[6:07:11] lParaa: well spires of ascension had transport between areas like rise does
[6:07:12] Thamarian: I think Kara was designed with M+ in mind
[6:07:13] Primit1ve: Scrap the mega dungeon and give me a 10man raid
[6:07:26] Lorrdzik: @auby6 why not both? Legion has mega dungeon and 2 normal new dungeons
[6:07:26] CMTerp: half-ish
[6:07:37] the_bhagwan: ppl do heroics at max level 😮‍💨
[6:07:42] Ddemonee: adge
[6:07:42] kadashy1: why scrap it, just don't put it in m+ pool if it's not designed for m+
[6:07:50] Probab1e: There is an enormous amount of people that are strictly casual.
[6:07:57] Thamarian: Just don't break them in half
[6:07:57] heffdogga: wow not calling us normies today Gladge
[6:08:04] alejandro7com: Looks like the stream is discussing the topic of dungeons and raids in the game. Here's a clever and funny comment that you can make:
[6:08:12] certified86: they should make mega-dungeons a 10 man raid that lasts for the second half of the expansion
[6:08:13] RipThatGuySean: @heffdogga normie
[6:08:19] CMTerp: prior to this season, probably 95% of players never did a 20
[6:08:20] admok: I like the mega dungeon when it comes out and it feels like a small raid. But for m+ they are meh
[6:08:28] EggsDaddyLongLegs: How much of the playerbase does 18 and above then??
[6:08:31] nerefwow: Gambit is lit
[6:08:42] Lunamhm: I loved tazavesh
[6:08:44] Convection: Tazavesh Gambit took a lot of balancing to get to good
[6:08:45] vente97: wailing caverns(cata) m+ rework
[6:08:45] Ionized4: gambit LOGIN
[6:08:46] killabean4: tazavesh was a banger
[6:09:10] OmmyPlays: kara was the worst brought back in s4
[6:09:23] thasthebear: kara was garbage
[6:09:24] EnforcerGL: By the end of s4 Kara owned
[6:09:31] Thamarian: Mega Dungeons in M+ should be kept whole and have a decently long timer but only be available once a week as a 5 man raid lockout with higher ilvl gear
[6:09:36] nerefwow: Kara chess board LOS
[6:09:44] SILMAMIES: DRATTY
[6:09:44] antipheonixna: s1 war within have mists and maw pls Prayge

[6:09:53] Devastatedd: it's "Eclipse is"
[6:09:59] Laiken101: well today was ass
[6:09:59] yifors: why does the last phase of deios feel longer than first one everytime
[6:10:10] antipheonixna: it was a land orca fist fight today
[6:10:12] Zingerac: echo rise was 17:10 ?

[6:13:44] Dberjerak823: Higher seed from time trial I believe
[6:13:45] Jeliefysh: It shouldn't matter, they should both face the 1st seed from the other cup right?
[6:13:56] QQGamers: times vs other team in similar dungeons?
[6:13:57] wowsecretart: wouldnt it just be 1 from 1st and 4 from 2nd play
[6:14:07] KDaily: assign a score based on their map times from the tournament
[6:14:08] Foofie957: Either time trials or win/loss ratiofrom their respective brackets.
[6:14:10] beels189: Its just 1a v 4b, 1b v 4a etc
[6:14:11] Martinsmamma: no repeats ?
[6:14:18] KDaily: there should be a reason to go fast besides pass/fail

[6:14:53] Scoops__: do they not do another set of time trials for seeding?
[6:15:04] KillUAssie: you have to be strapped in to beat all teams at finals anyway
[6:15:05] LittleBigSteve: When is the grand finals?
[6:15:08] TommySeeker: what happened to sloth
[6:15:10] Boreall: I'm not sure why they don't just make MDI two different reward pools, the Experienced MDI players and the new MDI players, let the new players win something
[6:15:13] vente97: @LittleBigSteve 2 weeks from now
