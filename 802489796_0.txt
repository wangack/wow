[3:35:30] abracka_: morning peeps
[3:35:31] MrGattz: @Deadelus0 for one, if you lose a debit card your fucked. whoever finds it has full access to your direct bank account. 2, if someone swipes the numbers on something like a card reader in a gas station and uses the card to buy something, you cant dispute the claim with your bank. sometimes you can but with a credit card if someone steals the card you can dispute it easy and get your money back.
[3:35:31] Artivicii: nah not really
[3:35:53] Deadelus0: @lowilru so.. borrowing money increases a score... so you can borrow more?

[4:33:38] Ieetz0rR_: at least there seem to be a 32 slots bag drop from castle nathria PogChamp
[4:33:42] jeremykh1986: You know whats sad. Everyone is going nuts for the bag. Then shadowlands professions will just give bigger bags that replace that. So again, it's a waste. End up with like 42 slot bags being made lol
[4:33:43] Bugszy: i got it on my main 1st kill and its all i needed out there lol
[4:34:01] TheCliffyShow: I've killed him 5 times, no bag.

[4:36:57] Xarr614: @Sadisticmedic For sure. I like how the story changed after Cataclysm and added more lore. Definitely a great zone.
[4:36:58] Collected1: i dunno. i've seen too many people need repeat transplants to convince me i'm just going to accept what i got.
[4:36:58] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee always bragging about his hair.

[4:42:25] tr4ncetv: against roy? fuck yeah it will
[4:42:28] portmanteau99: that would still sit you down
[4:42:48] portmanteau99: it would still be like being hit be a truck at 30mph
[4:42:49] jure__: they are 3 years of each other, age plays no role in that fight
[4:42:50] Eshel: I’m sure it’s still got the factor - it wasn’t just the power it was the delivery
[4:42:54] PvtHudson093: the treasure being 11 herbs and spices
[4:42:57] tr4ncetv: look at the videos of tyson hitting the bag, he still has so much power.
[4:43:00] potatolisk: WHAT?
[4:43:14] TheCliffyShow: I thought it was DeNiro and Pachino
[4:43:14] jeremykh1986: @Towelliee Old dudes? I wouldn't get in the ring with Tyson even NOW
[4:43:14] Eshel: He was able to sneak that uppercut in when you didn’t expect it
[4:43:22] potatolisk: i would lay down on the floor if he looked mad at me LUL
[4:43:39] BadXo: get that money
[4:43:48] Grizzlies: I think Tyson still has the power he just doesn’t have the spedd and stamina
[4:43:48] grimmbladex: 10 minutes til bag boss
[4:43:50] Collected1: i wouldnt get in the same room as him
[4:43:59] jeremykh1986: @Towelliee Have you watched Tyson's training vidoes? He's back in shape. He doesn't have the stamina, he never did. But he's FAST and he's still got his shit. He will fuck you up fast.
[4:44:02] TheCliffyShow: Mike Tyson could be 90 in a wheelchair and I still wouldn't fight him.
[4:44:04] kcrackatoaa: Dude when did you get the onyx ?!?!?
[4:44:06] Skizzurp: i seen tyson on youtube training tho and he still looks likea killer

[4:44:22] chrslp: He's done more movies than fights for the past many years LUL
[4:44:28] Eshel: I ageee - if it’s not over in about 4 rounds ... Tyson is done
[4:44:47] jeremykh1986: Yeah it was for the hype but still. If he did what he did in those videos to Roy it's over.
[4:44:50] icemanj99: More importantly, are Tyson's teeth still sharp enough to take a chunk out of an ear? Kappa
[4:44:53] Tautrollet: There one rule about fight club
[4:44:53] Lockrocker: probably closer to aluminum mike, than iron mike
[4:44:53] Skizzurp: id def be afraid to take a tyson punch still
[4:45:07] rydae: During the filming of their fight scene in Ip Man 3 Tyson clipped Donnie Yen with a punch and Donnie said it almost put him on his ass. Really rattle his brains and Donnie can take a hit too.
[4:45:19] Eshel: @icemanj99 I mean - if he’s not getting bras butted he won’t have to :)

[4:50:59] SyWr: this bag has a high chance
[4:51:13] doomester: @Towelliee even if you bought the music, doesnt that means you own them?
[4:51:18] Eshel: Like your mom saying “go ahead, put that fork in the toaster...see what happens” lmfao
[4:51:28] kranztheman: such a high chance ive killed this guy four times and havnt gotten it...
[4:51:34] Zolnay: in Hungary you cannot watch any hungarian movies online because of copyright

[4:52:20] jeremykh1986: When you go the store and buy music. Or buy it online. You don't buy the rights to the music or to own it. All you did was buy the right to listen to it personally yourself.

[4:55:21] kranztheman: Dude better give me the bag
[4:55:24] Kromede: gl
[4:55:26] Xarr614: All raids in the game in 1 day is time consuming more than Challenging, a speedrun would be cool.
[4:55:30] Federaldemon: Bro catJAM
[4:55:31] MrGattz: @HumanityDH how is what different? macys paid for the license to play that music in their stores
[4:55:42] Fruicer: 32.5

[4:55:45] fistofnature: @Soddah i think there isnt a level gap anymore because you can party sync together
[4:55:45] kimmo_gaming: BrooooJam my man Kappa
[4:55:46] blade_killa: yea about 22%
[4:55:49] s_t_o_r_m__: twitch should get spotify integration, only people with spotify can hear the music or something..
[4:55:49] Kromede: got it for 1 toon, farmed for days
[4:55:55] Daggerdi3: Gimmie the loot!
[4:55:58] Eikus11: I got the bag on my second kill, wish I had that luck with mount drops haha

[4:56:04] shenson33: What up, morning everyone
[4:56:05] tr4ncetv: catJAM
[4:56:13] minael1: since this pre-launch event started i haven't got to see any fking rare in northrend. since when i have time to play, they all be 2-3 hours till respawn
[4:56:24] Kromede: bronJam Kappa
[4:56:24] Dwarfi: back in my day towelliee after dark was a thing
[4:56:35] s_t_o_r_m__: Oh shit my idea is great LUL
[4:56:57] jeremykh1986: @minael It's not 2 -3 hours. It's 21 mins to spaw and there are 21 rarespawns. Get Rare scanner addon and ask someone in chat to give you a location of the current one. After that it will tell you the next one in line to spawn.

[4:58:55] Xarr614: Just got it on my 3rd toon :) been farming these pretty hard for the Keepsake
[4:59:02] MrGattz: its a unique item bind on pick up. you cant have more than 1 per character anywhere
[4:59:05] refluxuations: what's the drop rate on 110 ilvl epics from these event rares? Trying to farm these on an alt and havent seen one piece drop in 3 hours doing all of them every 20 min
[4:59:13] Fenixzzz: lol Kromede it was a typo
[4:59:21] MrGattz: its lowish
[4:59:23] MrGattz: like 2%
[4:59:24] chrslp: @MrGattz Is there any way to give it to someone if you get a second?
[4:59:26] FUNKz: @UncleShanst wow head has drop rates
[4:59:27] kaylis_hayasei: damn, 3 people got the bag where i was at. Bro gave my mage gloves, cant complain too much

[4:59:35] rydae: I've gotten a rare about 1 in 3 kills.
[4:59:42] Secondbreakfasttt: havent touched any rare with my main, still dont bother with 34 slotbag. 30 is more then enough for me
[4:59:42] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: single digit %. But you can get multiple itemss from the rares
[4:59:57] Xarr614: @UncleShanst you can look on wowhead at the Icecrown Rares Loot Tables
[5:00:14] TheCliffyShow: I'm one dungeon away from 50 and you seem to be good luck with these.
[5:00:17] refluxuations: Ty chat, i'll look it up :)

[5:16:10] Dwarfi: Is that a new plater profile Towelliee?
[5:16:13] jeremykh1986: Yep hunters. Auto attack + button 1 and button 2 top damage.
[5:16:13] kjdocs: LOL@ mages.

[5:16:57] Khalio23: its really not that complicated. Its just the other dps thats a derp fest tbh
[5:16:59] cruzeal: current rotation for bloodtalons is shit
[5:17:01] chory_hydraulik: For me feral is less complicated than rougue
[5:17:18] jeremykh1986: Rogue is definitely more complicated than feral
[5:17:24] MrGattz: what are you smoking LUL feral is the most complex dps in the game
[5:17:25] baard90: I dont like the new bloodtalons either
[5:17:33] jeremykh1986: Rogue is maintaining dots and managing combo points. Feral is just maintain dots.
[5:17:33] dalaraz: rogue is feral without talents lol

[5:19:55] jeremykh1986: Like if you had to choose a feral druid or survival hunter you'd take the feral druid every time
[5:19:55] itsAAMONbruhh: if they gave feral more energy regen it would feel a lot better, right now after opener it just feels bad

I downloaded it because I find it really amazing, but the party/raid frame next to the actionbars, when I click a player, it doesn't target that player, if you get what I'm trying to say. Is that a bug or is that intentional for like mouse-over spells and stuff? I hope you can help me out :D

[7:16:15] whoisqnx: whats wrong with asmongold? @Aquadriel
[7:16:15] zaalgor: Hey man how is life Treating you????
[7:16:18] syncacide: @Towelliee ya @asmongold is gonna get burried

[7:16:28] AcidAbyss: asmon is a true believer
[7:16:30] ChiefBeard: Homeboy has a WoW chip in his arm.
[7:16:36] coachingpotatoes: if only he didn't get everything boosted/given for him
[7:16:36] TheFuriyon: Didn't you stream wrath on xfire?
[7:16:38] kriticoal: people hate asmongolds chat, not him personally.
[7:16:39] Aquadriel: whoisqnx nothing i am memeing jeez
[7:16:40] onikid89: asmongold belives in wow more than blizz belives in wow
[7:16:42] no_case: remember meadowlands 2009 hotel room number 106
[7:16:48] rurounijosh: we cant even have server discords cuz people are so fucking toxic
[7:16:57] Bl4ckSauce: He is a true Neckbeard
[7:17:02] coachingpotatoes: asmon tried darksouls and his viewer numbers dropped to gutter though
[7:17:04] cyb3rpan1c: sold out
[7:17:11] dalaraz: toxicity is the 2020 meta,everyone is looking for something to complain over
[7:17:14] kriticoal: just like soda, his chat is toxic af, but soda is funny to watch.
[7:17:21] DrewShing: he watches youtube with WoW pulled up
[7:17:23] sevens777s: @Towelliee asmondgold actually played demonsouls yesterday on hi s main channel
[7:17:24] ChiefBeard: @coachingpotatoes But those numbers are still VERY strong.
[7:17:27] ticma94: Asmon is a legend
[7:17:27] PAX1US: @coachingpotatoes did you watch his demon's souls stream two days ago? LUL
[7:17:35] Eikus11: Asmond is annoying but Zack is a cool guy
[7:17:38] BjornOtter: so crazy to me that Asmon still has such a shitty setup in his moms attic
[7:17:40] sorli_: @kriticoal He's way too sarcastic and snidy for me, can't ever tell if he's serious for even a second lol
[7:17:44] StoicTaurus: He recently have shown his played .. even with all the classic, he had 200d 'played on this level" on his character
[7:17:44] syncacide: @PAX1US i did
[7:17:45] cyb3rpan1c: true
[7:17:47] AngryAussie365: @dalaraz This is true, However loook @ 2020 what isn't there really 2 whinge about.
[7:17:55] coachingpotatoes: @ChiefBeard, oh yeah, but compared to. even then though, if we he went variety, he could've upped them numbers again, but yeah
[7:17:57] syphergod89: asmon was peaking 80k viewers on demon souls
[7:17:58] ManneehFresh: Would wow ever come out for ps5 or Xbox x?
[7:18:00] MILESkg21: love the late streams :)
[7:18:02] kBumky: hes playing more today
[7:18:03] jerseyfive: asmon is not a gamer, just a wow addict
[7:18:15] sorli_: He did that with Metro too i think
[7:18:15] jeeslouise: that says alot bout wow atm :D
[7:18:17] othraerir: asmon or zack?
[7:18:18] LolitaAldea: he really like the souls games
[7:18:31] sevens777s: its good for him though because if he doesnt wanna play wow he has proof that he doesnt have to
[7:18:32] Bogjaw: @Towelliee Asmon seems to play other games on his other channel more
[7:18:34] kBumky: now is the time for him to try other games, gunna be shadowlands for the next couple months/years
[7:18:35] TheFuriyon: I think he did that with Dark Souls 3?
[7:18:44] AcidAbyss: he got hooked on the souls games like an addict not surprised
[7:18:47] pedrodepacas1: yea fair he usually logs into wow for 2h to complain about store transmog and no endgame content that he doesnt do anyway before doing something else ;)
[7:18:52] domnero: farming mounts is both great and frustating
[7:19:10] whoisqnx: agreed
[7:19:15] TheFuriyon: It's either farm mounts, level alts or wait 6h 40m for a 34 slot bag
[7:19:15] ssjw1337: doubt it
[7:19:19] TheFuriyon: pick your poison
[7:19:19] DrewShing: it's kinda like you said earlier tho..people are taking a break before the real expansion grind begins
[7:19:20] dalaraz: i wish so
[7:19:21] necowarrant: shadowlands is huge
[7:19:21] Staksor: at least it won't be worse than BfA LUL
[7:19:22] coachingpotatoes: @pedrodepacas1, hey! not fair! he also slowwalks to that pandaria boss to never get his transmog for 3 hours of the stream
[7:19:23] sorli_: It won't,
[7:19:25] no_case: best pre patch youve ever played?
[7:19:26] fraris: i liked even BFA so.. shadowlands will be crazy
[7:19:28] 5gz_5g: Keyword "Could" Right? Kapp
[7:19:34] ChiefBeard: I feel it bruh. I think SL is gonna be good and im a hating fanboy.
[7:19:47] MOLAR305: as long as they find a way for the systems to stay relevant, and not have to introduce new systems as content @towelliee
[7:19:49] CrowCommando: @fraris same
[7:20:05] SsenkradDesruc: @Towelliee a few months age I asked you whether you thought SL could become the best expansion so far and you said no. What made you change your mind?
[7:20:05] dalaraz: rip nax,people will jsut raidlog,thats classic anyway @Towelliee
[7:20:08] Slimbo82: And diablo new seson on 22
[7:20:10] sevens777s: I think shadowlands will be at the same level of legion in terms of people liking it
[7:20:16] coachingpotatoes: @ChiefBeard, maw and torghast isn't getting u worried at all?
[7:20:16] othraerir: why didn't they push naxx back to jan?
[7:20:17] Staksor: "race"
[7:20:21] pedrodepacas1: 2h is overestimating it
[7:20:22] necowarrant: :)))
[7:20:29] sorli_: Who tf cares about wf naxx LULW
[7:20:31] FatChase: Naxx out? PogChamp
[7:20:32] TheFuriyon: Isn't SL moreso weekly based compared to BFA and legions daily farm?
[7:20:33] griffinjj: bfa was the first xpac i didnt play on launch and playing it the last 2 months has been pretty fun
[7:20:39] BjornOtter: @Towelliee What juice you got in there ?
[7:20:44] VIRUSplw: 2h with gathering world buffs LUL
[7:20:45] Bayne77: you think they will be able to figure out naxx strats that quickly? Kappa
[7:20:45] DrewShing: it will or it wont lol
[7:20:45] MILESkg21: already forgot classic was a thing KEKW
[7:20:49] ChiefBeard: @coachingpotatoes I literally cannot be worse than BFA.
[7:20:50] sorli_: Did you say that about bfa too or
[7:20:59] ChiefBeard: @coachingpotatoes It*
[7:20:59] dalaraz: if 50% is to be the best,wahts ist the other 50 ? :p @Towelliee
[7:21:00] MOLAR305: yesterday's beta test gave me an itch I cant scratch for 9 days....
[7:21:03] coachingpotatoes: @griffinl27, u have all the catchup mechanics now though, which makes the experience quite different
[7:21:07] sevens777s: @ towelliee did bfa have that chance prelaunch
[7:21:07] Seerated: Blizz is almost competing with themselves, not sure if that was the best move. Many Classic-players will prio Naxx over retail, thinking they'll "catch up leveling" after
[7:21:22] janaparks: i liked the scourge event
[7:21:25] BjornOtter: @Towelliee was talking about the vape juice LUL
[7:21:39] TheFuriyon: On top of that, there's a new season of diablo 3 coming out in 6 days too, so yea blizz kinda shot themselves in the foot with overlapping releases
[7:21:45] griffinjj: @coachingpotatoes thats actually what has made it fun. A bit more of a casual now so now being able to play as much it is nice to always have somethign to login looking forward to
[7:21:46] coachingpotatoes: @chiefbeard, well maw and torghast are 2x visions from the start
[7:21:46] domnero: 8.2 was the shit
[7:21:55] necowarrant: and alts
[7:21:56] Lazyloa: So true
[7:21:57] Staksor: I enjoyed 8.2 a lot
[7:21:57] VIRUSplw: damn exacly
[7:22:02] apexmind: its not alt friendly
[7:22:03] Lazyloa: Catchup was awful
[7:22:03] Dayn_tm: BoD was legti one of the best raids ever.
[7:22:11] Kreech: Not being alt friendly hurt
[7:22:13] Quimby54: bfa was alright, only took a break when i got carpal tunnel
[7:22:17] cronymahoney: Islands ftw LUL
[7:22:21] DrewShing: do you think 60 is cap max level now? or they gonna start the climb back to 120 again?
[7:22:22] AngryAussie365: The Last part of BFA, ruined it.. The first part was nice till we ran out of content
[7:22:24] EggwithEdges: That happened to me, sadly
[7:22:24] faulen: There are to many systems and things to keep track of it make it a good expansion. It will have to change to much to make it good.
[7:22:26] rurounijosh: ya that 2 month gate was dumb as fuck
[7:22:27] Aquadriel: lol imagine taking breaks from wow, noobs Kappa
[7:22:29] Kin_: I could handle Artifact power, but Azerite/Corruption was too much
[7:22:31] VIRUSplw: 3 months of cathing up just to get another grind
[7:22:32] terribalgamer: my main only has the essence given to you at the beginning...
[7:22:37] janaparks: i stopped playing wow after wrath and started again in legion and loved it BFA was such a disappointment
[7:22:37] DonVladdy: 100% @Towelliee , coming back made me wanna leave again lmao
[7:22:37] AngryAussie365: @Aquadriel I quit during it lol.
[7:22:41] coachingpotatoes: @griffinl27, oh i get that, but it's not the "real expansion experience". people got burned out by all the timegating, too much to grind per week etc.
[7:22:43] necowarrant: yeah thats great
[7:22:57] VIRUSplw: i hope so
[7:23:06] deathclassique: I just wonder if MMOs can really bring in new players by the droves
[7:23:06] ChiefBeard: @coachingpotatoes I liked visions -_- I only played patch 8.1 and 8.3 skipped 8.2 because of the obvious. 8.3 was great for me. Came in farmed and my stuff and then I was out.
[7:23:07] Shamwise: This is how SWG went to hell
[7:23:09] cronymahoney: sounds good
[7:23:09] prismo5: basically the people who got screwed by bfa
[7:23:10] Seerated: @KerradiN94 Sure, it'll interfere with either playerbase.
[7:23:11] necowarrant: play the game
[7:23:12] FatChase: Kapp
[7:23:13] janaparks: Clap
[7:23:13] SaDos: @Towelliee in my opinion the worst part of bfa was that you couldnt get azerite gear from dungeons and you had to pay insane amounts of residum to get the ones you want
[7:23:21] maalow: this is how you keep a game alive
[7:23:22] PAX1US: I hope it's not the "Kapp" KEKW
[7:23:37] faulen: There are too many things with a cap to make it good
[7:23:38] Bl4ckSauce: that's nice
[7:23:43] haydong2020: Casuals rule WoW
[7:23:50] mrdragonroar: give plebs two mouth and they will start complaing of how boring SL is
[7:23:56] Lazyloa: Thank god lol funny how BiS will make me play more versus titanforging/warforging rng
[7:23:58] Sweetzer81: thats a bold stategy Cotton, I wonder how it'll work out for them in the end
[7:24:01] necowarrant: cap is good
[7:24:07] whoisqnx: I will be busy looking at the beautiful zones after i am done with everything for the week, no time for other games KEKW
[7:24:12] TheFuriyon: So items can't roll with tertiary stats any more? (Leech, socket, speed etc)
[7:24:14] whoisqnx: the zones are so goood
[7:24:14] DrewShing: shadowlands has to happen for the future of the game i think. gotta bring people in. even cash cows slowly leave.
[7:24:28] sevens777s: I rather a cap then wow feeling like a mindless grind fest slash job
[7:24:28] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/-eGBUXg0d_A BEST PROT PALADIN COVENANT FOR M+
[7:24:30] EggwithEdges: First people say no cap is bad then it's cap is bad, heh
[7:24:30] parlangua89: Renown is the only thing you really have to worry about
[7:24:38] griffinjj: @coachingpotatoes ya i loved grinding and raiding just cant do it anymore so at least for me as a casual now it has been nice especially with lockdowns
[7:24:45] Aquadriel: @Towelliee thing is many players now want to log on and immediately jump into heroic raiding, ranked arena or rbgs lol. that's not how a mmo works
[7:24:46] parlangua89: And that’s weekly capped so yeah
[7:24:47] ssjw1337: I'd be lucky to finish it on 0 characters
[7:24:53] ticma94: Imma do it on my Ret main and finish mythic Nathria and thats it
[7:24:54] oopatwow: what about WQs towlliee am I gonna swamped in them
[7:25:04] TheRukis: is it possible to cap it with one character with a 9-5? LOL
[7:25:11] MILESkg21: Styga or something
[7:25:12] parlangua89: Yeah what I meant was that’s they only thing you don’t want to fall behind on.
[7:25:12] feherlofia123: remember the guy who said you wouldnt hit 50 on all toons before launch
[7:25:16] mionbre: towPalm
[7:25:22] purpleshadow1: collect lots of anima per week
[7:25:23] dalaraz: soul ash ? @Towelliee
[7:25:23] othraerir: so what are wq's? just rep?
[7:25:33] mionbre: !watchtime
[7:25:34] TheFuriyon: RIP there's a hunter
[7:25:35] haydong2020: Flappy Bird WQ in Bastion lol
[7:25:41] dracullus: @Towelliee Preach made good video what is optional and what's not for people coming back
[7:25:52] MrClaudeSeaburn: @Towelliee How was the beta experience so far? is it fun so far
[7:26:12] ShowDUH: there's like 20 total ish
[7:26:21] ShowDUH: like 5 per zone
[7:26:21] AngryAussie365: there is maybe 5 per zone
[7:26:22] Aquadriel: dont understand idiots who say old dailies were better than wqs lol
[7:26:24] dalaraz: plus wq dont really give something
[7:26:24] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee 3 or 4 per sone for WQs?
[7:26:25] parlangua89: No man wqs are not required cause there is other ways to get rep now
[7:26:26] Vuhnylla: No Stygia weekly cap (35k overall), just the 5 Tier maw system where you’ll die when you hit 5.
[7:26:31] Aidler: MOP was daylie heaven
[7:26:38] Quimby54: @Aquadriel basically the same thing, you just dont need to pick up or hand in lol
[7:26:49] Aquadriel: Quimby54 exactly
[7:27:02] Meshindale: dont you have to grind alot to fill in the vault weekly?
[7:27:12] tarabibble: nnorman111 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[7:27:12] Moobot: Thanks @NNORMAN111 for subbing for 5 months! towHAMUP
[7:27:14] parlangua89: @meshindale Not really
[7:27:14] Aquadriel: but wqs you can pick the 4 you want and get a good reward
[7:27:15] Vuhnylla: Vault is awesome, once they fix the duplicate items, it’ll be so perfect!
[7:27:22] Sieldme1: Wait, this isn't out yet.. right? Is this still beta or something?
[7:27:23] TheCliffyShow: Gamers have to work more to get more. They are not gonna like that.
[7:27:35] zmr44: @Towelliee do you know how to set stacking nameplates with plater ?
[7:27:38] alexowhy: HYPERS this thing is amazing
[7:27:43] haydong2020: so dope
[7:27:56] dalaraz: y up to 0 choices is good
[7:27:56] Aidler: most of the things in the vault I can't even do towLul . don't pvp, don't m+ only lfr raid
[7:27:57] dalaraz: 9*
[7:27:59] Clicklesly: But you always only get one loot for all of them, right?
[7:27:59] zmr44: @Towelliee it wont let me click the option for some reason
[7:28:00] haydong2020: so no Chests ??
[7:28:04] cyb3rpan1c: chance
[7:28:07] ArroArroArro: only 1 of those 9, not 1 from each row, before someone asks
[7:28:08] Lazyloa: These are the chests
[7:28:10] dalaraz: yy its 9 choices to get 1
[7:28:11] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP
[7:28:11] Lazyloa: right?
[7:28:16] othraerir: you get to choose 1 option
[7:28:16] TheKwolve: How does the ilvl on that work? Is it the same across the board?
[7:28:20] Vuhnylla: This takes the place of chests.
[7:28:24] Malexand6742: @Towelliee Is M+ capped at 10 for the first season?
[7:28:28] dracullus: @Towelliee but Raids row is only from Castle Nathria loot table, right?
[7:28:30] AP__Simps: what makes the ilvl difference @Towelliee
[7:28:30] janaparks: im a casual and i can do mythic plus
[7:28:37] haydong2020: thats pretty ez
[7:28:38] chubby_ch4ser: I like that system!
[7:28:39] SaDos: @Towelliee but the ilvl of the gear depends on the diffuculty of the content you did
[7:28:40] chavodk: thats seems like fine to me
[7:28:41] ryanmoss35: such a better system
[7:28:43] poop__2_: that is awesome
[7:28:51] blackgio789: That's amazing
[7:28:56] Snurrekanin123: Gonna be horrible to sim :D But i agree its way better than current :)
[7:28:58] ShadoodHD: oh no more chores Kappa
[7:28:58] Davedaman26: does it work if you defeat the boss in lfr?
[7:29:01] MrEvilRex: so if you complete all 9 slots u still only get 1 gear?
[7:29:02] Tigerklaue: and you still get 4 boots LUL
[7:29:03] dalaraz: gear ilvl scales with the diffifulty you fill those requirements so its good too
[7:29:04] Eshel: Is the pvp slots only pvp gear ?
[7:29:04] logic970: wow, thats a much better system
[7:29:06] janaparks: oh wow
[7:29:07] MILESkg21: POGGERS
[7:29:11] Tysaur: thats actually kinda sick
[7:29:11] s_t_o_r_m__: Looks goods
[7:29:11] Artivicii: wait what is this
[7:29:11] idenkaz_: i like that
[7:29:14] ulamog7: so you pick 1 item out of 9 potentially? right?
[7:29:16] griffinjj: wow this is awesome
[7:29:21] janaparks: so you can pick between 9 at most
[7:29:23] ryanmoss35: @ShadoodHD Not really a chore, its playing the game
[7:29:24] parlangua89: @mrevilrex Yes but you have the option of what gear piece you want or need
[7:29:35] zigzugg: didn't they say the vault wouldn't contain weapons or something?
[7:29:39] Fluxifys: is there going to be a diffrence in ilvl or all the same?
[7:29:39] Just_Jaybles: is that lfr as well?
[7:29:40] Syprus1: constant 9ms... dam im constant 35 which aint bad but daum 9 is virtually zero latency
[7:29:44] Just_Jaybles: for the raid
[7:29:44] lekkahdh: So you can do everything, and just pick ONE piece? towOof
[7:29:46] dalaraz: 3 is pvp 3 is raid and 3 is m+ so you dont really need all nine,4 or 5 will come naturally
[7:29:47] FutileDiploma: @Towelliee should i be pushing for top gear now or just wait for shadowlands because it will get replaced
[7:29:50] AngryAussie365: @zigzugg Prob they love 2 gate weapons
[7:29:55] shmurcules: I’ll have your stream on while I level
[7:29:56] parlangua89: Instead of getting a random pice out of a chest
[7:30:01] Artivicii: so we have raiders, pvpers, and now m+ players? PogChamp
[7:30:10] Eshel: Anyone? Is the PvP slots PvP gear only ?
[7:30:22] asbringers: FutileDiploma free 100 & 110 i lvl gear with event
[7:30:23] sevens777s: @FutileDiploma do the prepatch dailies for gear
[7:30:31] idenkaz_: you cant get the same item Ion said. or something like that
[7:30:37] othraerir: imagine that hahah
[7:30:37] TheFuriyon: So the best thing to do is to do 10 +15s?
[7:30:39] Aidler: unless it's bugged
[7:30:40] IiveviI: goood i got x13 weeks of 130 ilvl rings on my rogue....
[7:30:42] Shrandamar: 9 cloaks DansGame
[7:30:44] Codeiyna: @Towelliee In BFA i have received 3 weeks in a row gloves :|
[7:30:44] Tzarvahl: Has anyone in here leveled as affliction warlock in legion using chromie?? I'm trying to do the affliction artifact quest and it's making me use demonic gateway, but im not high enough level? lol
[7:30:44] Eshel: As a PvE player am I wasting my time unlocking the PvP slots?
[7:31:09] TheGraminator: Kappa
[7:31:10] Artivicii: BEST PogChamp
[7:31:11] parlangua89: @thestankybeard You don’t need to do the artifact quests
[7:31:12] deno568: As someone thinking of buying WoW, is it better to wait until Shadowland drops? Or do you have access to some expansion contents beforehand?
[7:31:13] dalaraz: @FutileDiploma gather some 100ilvl loot through t he vendor with scourgestones in icc atm,dont rally bother for more imo
[7:31:19] sorli_: Did you say that about BFA too? LULW
[7:31:20] adamfrost81: whats been your favorite expansion so far?
[7:31:27] OmegaWave77: OmegaWave77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[7:31:36] othraerir: 226
[7:31:40] Horuseternal69: @nobac0n you have access to every expansion before hand then get access to SL when it launches too
[7:31:43] Toranrato: Which Portal did you take? i know that you get alot of options to choose from @Towelliee
[7:31:46] Artivicii: ima be farming m+ zbtvDay
[7:31:48] GeoMachinaX: im a solo player for the most part so im lowkey loving it lol
[7:31:58] Tigerklaue: but no bonusrolls in shadowlands so its less loot
[7:31:59] Vannkier: @sorli_ nobody did, the reception of bfa since beta was overwhelmingly bad
[7:32:02] ShowDUH: @sorli_ nobody said that about BFA XD we knew what we were going into coming from the legion grind XD
[7:32:14] dracullus: I think very quickly people doing M+ will just pick "2 choices" option
[7:32:16] Eshel: Are the PvP slots going to be PvP gear only ? Anyone know?
[7:32:20] girthyderps: Haven't played the beta and I really hope for SL to be great. The only thing that worries me, is the best xpacs (imo) did not cater to casual players/ alts. The xpacs that did (WoD) were terrible (imo again). Not trolling.
[7:32:21] Morduuh: good
[7:32:23] dalaraz: @Tigerklaue but no titanforge so you dont care
[7:32:25] Codeiyna: I'm happy that they have removed all the systems from BFA it was really annoying and you would go behind very fast if you lack
[7:32:32] ShowDUH: @Eshel should be pvp gear, m+ gear and raid gear
[7:32:34] flyingmachin3: LUL
[7:32:43] Artivicii: @Towelliee are you maining horde paladin for SL?
[7:32:56] oopatwow: how long u think its gonna take your average Joe to get to max level

[7:32:57] Tzarvahl: @parlangua89 so how do I unlock the class orderhall to start questing?
[7:33:07] Aquadriel: fucking company wanting to make money HotPokket
[7:33:12] Eshel: @showderpy Thank you !! Now I know I can skip doing the PvP challenges altogether
[7:33:16] haydong2020: Keep us addicted
[7:33:35] dracullus: @Towelliee I don't know if Ion want this, but many people was very vocal about it last 6+ years, so let's see how this loot system will work
[7:33:36] gotdatpiff420: even if im not playing i always leave my sub on
[7:33:38] Vuhnylla: My only worry for SL from playing Beta is the linear leveling. ALL players in the same zones at the same time is scary. Yesterday’s “stress test” was pretty rough

[7:33:41] RonJeremyyz: i mean thats fine, its more exciting to farm BIS then azerite
[7:33:48] yeaahyeah: Ide rather have goals to work twords, rather than having Wod where youre just done
[7:33:50] deno568: @horuseternal69 I see. I thought there was some SL contents after seeing max lvl changes.
[7:33:51] dalaraz: its way better than bfa true
[7:34:05] 420fortnitefan: Just saw a scourge Ghoul in Org. I thought that wasnt until Tuesday?
[7:34:05] rauch_: rauch_ subscribed with Prime. 
[7:34:07] Aidler: SL will probably be the expansion with the least things to do for me with my playstyle. time to do other games..
[7:34:15] unholyhoit: at least we don't need 6 sets of gear anymore
[7:34:18] Artivicii: legion PogChamp
[7:34:21] dalaraz: titanforge remvoed make it better already,no matter what
[7:34:23] Goat_Lord_NoahTF: W OMEGALUL D

[7:34:39] anacronz: legenderies in sl is same with traits on bfa :P
[7:34:41] girthyderps: One (good) thing about titan forging was the chance to build something that was not bis, but was (possibly) as good, or better.
[7:34:46] unholyhoit: @Artivicii if you forget the first patch
[7:34:47] EggwithEdges: I hated Legion at the beginning so much
[7:34:49] dalaraz: legion whould be the best if you could aquire legendaries properly
[7:34:50] Moobot: we use Luxthos's WeakAuras! You can find all his WAs at https://wago.io/search/luxthos || For the green leveling exp WA, you can find that our !discord under the #ui-and-wa-info channel!
[7:34:55] FatChase: And the fact you can target the slot, stats and effects @Towelliee
[7:35:20] idenkaz_: I think what will keep me playing in the first tier is to level characters and try covernants and get the mounts and tmogs. I dont raid first tier so i have more time for solo stuff.
[7:35:24] sorli_: All this sounds good but i will never preorder again after BFA, going to wait and see how streamers/community reacts to see if i'll get SL

[7:36:38] haydong2020: TBC ??
[7:36:39] sjodyssey01: it's starcraft and Warcraft
[7:36:43] Djfarmville: even more than legion?
[7:36:46] idenkaz_: big plus for SL
[7:36:50] danskenntv: Thats why you've to power lvl without 8 hours :o
[7:36:50] WhoSaidObeya: more than TBC?
[7:36:51] Fptlol: tbc had a tonne on launch
[7:36:58] danskenntv: within**
[7:36:59] Fptlol: all those raids
[7:37:04] quakegoogl: @Towelliee Squid1 grubL
[7:37:07] Tigerklaue: at least everything has a weekly cap
[7:37:28] RobinDePoppin: What is your prediction for 9.1 & 9.2 @Towelliee
[7:37:30] unholyhoit: "as expected" that's a horrible way to look at it
[7:37:33] anacronz: you can get legenderies before raid any m+ starts?
[7:37:35] TIny_Rrick: tbc will save wow just like classic saved wow
[7:37:40] fooxytv: this is it
[7:37:43] espasona1: login que times are going to be crazy for the first couple weeks
[7:37:44] haydong2020: TBC goated
[7:37:44] Aidler: hmm I'm sceptical
[7:37:55] NA_Mus: watch them pull a bc and make jailor a mid boss ;)
[7:37:55] Tigerklaue: naxx 3.0 with kt again LUL
[7:38:01] nullifie: The front loading would confuse a lot of people, they would probably have problem with casuals this time around.
[7:38:02] Codeiyna: Jaina becomes the new Lich King :D as in Hearthstone Jaina DK :D
[7:38:03] zigzugg: so is slyvannas not an end raid boss?
[7:38:09] Aquadriel: things that will make me hate SL: 1) sylvannas redemption. 2) arthas redemption.
[7:38:14] dracullus: @Towelliee lets stop you here, we have ton of returning players that will leave shortly after release no matter what cause they are not really interested in max level grinds
[7:38:30] dalaraz: 1 raid per lore story makes sense
[7:38:30] RobinDePoppin: I hope it will be something that's completely unknown to us
[7:38:42] whoisqnx: new naxx with updated graphics Kreygasm
[7:38:42] idenkaz_: Our fav Bear PepeHands
[7:38:48] jure__: they already said before BFA that Sylvanas wont be a raid boss
[7:38:50] simoensays: You doing 24h stream on releaseday?
[7:38:51] othraerir: naxx 3.0
[7:39:05] whoisqnx: i would be so happy with a new naxx with updated graphics
[7:39:06] zigzugg: SoO 2.0
[7:39:08] MetalManGG: @drdunkas 240h marathon
[7:39:10] Trailerhitch: sure you've answered b4... what are channel points gonna be labeled?
[7:39:12] ArroArroArro: @drdunkas oonly 24 hours? its gonna be like 9 straight days
[7:39:12] Artivicii: big big big
[7:39:16] NA_Mus: silvannas will end up like magatha grimtotem. Exiled and forgotten about after the expac
[7:39:19] dracullus: @Towelliee imo 9.1 focused on Sylvanas, 9.2 Arthas (but not as boss), 9.3 Jailer
[7:39:20] d1stract10n: what if Jailer isnt the final raid of the xpac
[7:39:20] RobinDePoppin: That sounds fun! :D
[7:39:24] Aquadriel: @Towelliee do you think they will make a series of cgi cinematics again, like with saurfang?
[7:39:30] tonixx619: man i would fucken love a necrolords raid that is like naxx
[7:39:33] Dwarfi: Bertybert

[7:39:47] idenkaz_: nice enjoy those days off
[7:39:49] TheCliffyShow: We will fight the most deadilest entity in all of WoW...Millhouse Manastorm.
[7:39:52] DennisTried: anima or enema?

[7:39:59] sevens777s: can we vote on what points do ?
[7:40:03] wreckshoptv: i have like 115k points :P
[7:40:11] Tigerklaue: quin has cool point rewards
[7:40:11] MrEvilRex: so what you are saying is I should spend my points now?
[7:40:14] Trailerhitch: We'll miss you
[7:40:18] dalaraz: rest to go all in is the plan
[7:40:18] jokkzie: Rest from playing games :)
[7:40:20] xhaven: So time to use these? LUL
[7:40:22] Eshel: I have a theory on Sylvanas that would kinda loophole that statement - I think the real Sylvanas has been a prisoner of the Jailer since the end of WotLK ... the current Sylvanas is a dread lord working for the Jailer that we’ll kill
[7:40:23] flyingmachin3: anymore lego streams before xpac
[7:40:29] yeaahyeah: I have 135k I hope they dont reset
[7:40:32] Aquadriel: do you think they will make a series of cgi cinematics again, like with saurfang?
[7:40:40] RobinDePoppin: I like to be able to time people out with my points LUL
[7:40:40] Dwarfi: hydrate, stretch is the most i see
[7:40:41] AngryAussie365: I Vote there needs 2 be a shot button especially during the Marathon
[7:40:47] zigzugg: that one was my favorite :(
[7:40:49] ShadoodHD: do you still get money from ads?
[7:40:49] mmrghost7: bring heal the woons back
