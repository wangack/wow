[0:05:04] Driix6: bjpDriix 📣 Gay fact 1: Like the world of sports, the gaming world has been slow and resistant to addressing homophobia or including gay content. Early efforts to include gay characters have often been deemed stereotypical or derogatory but there have been experimental efforts made to try and change that. Gayge Stay tuned for more Gay facts!

[1:02:04] DoppeLDouble: bigger number better
[1:02:10] gil910: @4RealBrah actually, it's more about the average dmg per swing. Speed in itself is technically irrelevant but obviously impacts the damage per hit
[1:02:10] BlixzO: alot of sta & good wep
[1:02:13] gayforcandy: wouldnt the ideal levelling build just be something that can swap between 1-h and 2-h

[1:03:12] ihopeyourehappynow: fury is worse with more than 2 mobs
