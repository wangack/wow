[3:10:41] a_noob_is__: hey @swifty  is it raining there?
[3:10:46] MoonChocolates: The ban only happens if u continous do nothing every round
[3:10:51] JokerJK_: Swifty did you ever try FF14?
[3:10:52] zaetemira: people that are afra.d are süthe
[3:10:57] zaetemira: usual suspects of afks

[3:11:03] SSD511_: Because they used to afk
[3:11:08] ItsDerpDiggler: @Swifty Scared of trolls getting you banned for simply defending a base and Blizz is doing a bad job and finding a better solution.
[3:11:12] PermaGrinnn: cause blue literally said doing stuff like defending alone is not participating
[3:11:16] PermaGrinnn: blue post*
[3:11:17] ItsDerpDiggler: at*

[3:13:12] Chrimz_: 15 sec
[3:13:20] drdishwasher: holy has exorcism too
[3:13:22] JokerJK_: 15 secs normally
[3:13:27] CasualTwitchLurker: low CD? 15 sec is long for a rotation spell XD
[3:13:34] ItsDerpDiggler: @PermaGrinnn Yeah but people aren't getting banned for JUST defending. There are trolls reporting players for standing in a base for 2mins while it caps and the people are still getting banned. Blizz needs to actually investigate these claims instead of automating bans after a few reports.
[3:13:36] conkersbadfurday: isnt it a cast?
[3:13:36] khal0x: are you a paladin preg?
[3:13:58] Dwchico: android no dub option if anyone knows how to prime sub

[3:15:21] nashonatorrr: at lvl 72 you can get art of war and holyshocks
[3:15:37] KodiakJedi: You hit the sub button...and then there's an option to select prime instead of the normal sub if it's available and not already in use.
[3:15:38] Jlsfromdk: danLUL danLUL
[3:15:43] elliot0915: I haven’t been able to prime sub on mobile in forever

[4:42:11] mything696: mage is counter for paly
[4:42:13] LieutenantSnail: Are you going into wotlk with Paladin or Warrior first?
[4:42:13] fowlentv: why cant you bubble?
[4:42:16] azgarth18: So mage can block but pally cant bubble LOL!
[4:42:31] mrezwider: Bubble is fine it’s a 5 min cd
[4:42:43] fowlentv: thats like saying rogues cant stealth @Swifty lol
[4:42:45] bry114: naw what who says its cheating? weirdos ?
[4:42:46] rainraira: @mrezwider agree
[4:42:46] bearlore1: Thats BS
[4:42:48] yasashiikemen: lol..its part of the toolkit
[4:42:48] mrezwider: Just dual again and you don’t have bubble if you want results without bubble
[4:42:49] donniemark: That's kinda dumb... bubble is essential part of paladin gameplay...
[4:42:55] yasashiikemen: bubble for life:D
[4:43:00] LieutenantSnail: They just allowed Lay on Hands to be used in Dragonflight!

[4:43:19] bry114: lol
[4:43:19] bearlore1: mage has a bubble plus block
[4:43:21] skylynx06: its cause pallies can heal themselves while bubble without getting interrupted
[4:43:29] Stalefos: is AV still broken?
[4:43:30] GriggerMonster: if they use the bubble that means they already lost and now the person they're dueling has to try to kill them again
[4:43:37] GriggerMonster: imo
[4:43:50] fowlentv: yes @Stalefos
[4:43:51] peanutgnome: not using bubble is like giving them the illusion of winning LUL
[4:43:56] bilboslappins: we all know the real reason why people say bubble is cheating and it has nothing to do with the paladin using it
[4:44:03] mrezwider: Ok again they just dual again right after
[4:44:08] mrezwider: And they have no bubble
[4:44:15] juuhabach: this music Kreygasm
[4:44:16] bry114: thats the whole point of over skilling a pally. u burst till they bubble and reset.
[4:44:17] bearlore1: Bubble is part of pally package
[4:44:20] XamusTV: did blizzard actually ninja nerf the sheild slam build?
[4:44:26] XamusTV: was gonna try it
[4:44:28] bry114: if u can't kill a pally who bubbles thats on u.
[4:44:32] Niko_CS: is av stll broken?
[4:44:41] mrezwider: So you can’t use bubble in arena right ??????? No you can I remember now
