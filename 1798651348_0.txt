[4:44:24] freetherocktv: @mavericks312 a lot of major repeatable news networks large and small use twitter along with sports news like adam shefter where you hear stuff first over anything else. Not saying its all true there is a lot of BS noise out there unfortunately. Not defending twitter just saying its where people get their news now.

[5:22:48] c0mmander_starscream: Pepperoni pie from Benny Todino's in Hoboken
[5:23:00] Sollice: Colts would be better off trading for Trevor Lance from SF
[5:23:10] Sollice: If they arent going to pick one up from draft
[5:23:13] mavericks312: And if they trade up it‚Äôs gonna cost at the least 2 1st rd picks
[5:23:13] bloodgulch_survivor: trade the best defensive player for someone that might not be good in the nfl. Smart
[5:23:33] mavericks312: Texans aren‚Äôt sold on qb at 2
[5:23:40] PigPenLen: defensive coach
[5:23:43] c0mmander_starscream: Colts would just be better off and move to another city

[5:24:19] mavericks312: Texans could tank for Williams next year

[5:26:41] mavericks312: Honestly I wanted the falcons to get lamar
[5:26:41] OpiumHC: as classic inspired some retail changes, do you think hardcore will have an impact in retail changes too?
[5:26:44] phocho: Lamar
[5:26:44] RocketvanPersie: theyre thinking since the ravens signed OBJ hes gonna stay
[5:26:53] Sollice: Any team can offer whatever, I believe Colts have first matching rights but if they dont he is free agent
[5:26:53] phocho: Lamar's greedy ass still wants 230 guaranteed
[5:26:58] Jango_: Will Levis is a surer bet than richardson, imo if your looking for a day 1 starter

[5:27:11] JakloomGaming770: he wants a deshaun watson money and isnt going to get it
[5:27:18] Jango_: Richardson is going to have to sit for a year
[5:27:28] LimpyMcGee1: Joe Burrow is just sitting back loving these high signings.
[5:27:32] Shugaze: maybe he got to redridge
[5:27:34] Sollice: I dunno that its greed. Deshawn got 250 million guranteed and he had....issues. Everyone should be blaming Cleavland
[5:27:35] mavericks312: @jakloomgaming770 tbf he is worth Watson money more then watson
[5:27:35] butt3r_gaming: the A's are a minor league team anyway
[5:27:45] OpiumHC: antonio is going from goldshire, to westfall, then duskwoof and redridge
[5:27:46] phocho: Watson money is stupid, Browns are nuts for giving him all that guarantee money
[5:27:47] Jango_: @LimpyMcGee1 he will be paid
[5:27:54] Goncalvo: I think he travels to redridge and back
[5:27:54] OpiumHC: duskwood*
[5:27:55] gfield2k: The problem is. The owners don't want to set a market full of guaranteed QB contracts, For that amount of money @Towelliee
[5:27:58] RocketvanPersie: if all the best defensive players are somehow taken by 6, i wouldnt mind the lions taking will levis
[5:28:06] Sollice: @phocho This is truth. Browns are dumb

[5:28:41] phocho: it's not about having or not having, you just dont give 200+ mil guarantee
[5:28:41] Alienfromger: does that count for asking for help? LUL
[5:28:49] mavericks312: Having it and wanting to give it is 2 different things
[5:28:55] gfield2k: You don't stay rich. By doing things you don't want to do. lol
[5:28:58] Sollice: @Towelliee The problem with guranteed money is the players. Owners will give them 5 years 250 million guranteed, and then the players on YEAR 3 want to renegotiate their contracts and threaten to sit out
[5:28:59] OpiumHC: he can be in westfall and duskwood too

[6:18:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: I still want to hear more about the Blizzard survival MMO, that could happen at Blizzcon this year
[6:18:11] Sollice: @Sollice Yeah exactly
[6:18:16] Dred_Scythe: 2019

[6:20:28] Keyastaron_: or something
[6:20:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: last thing you want is for everyone to get bored of your endgame for free
[6:20:42] Sollice: It serves zero purpose for them to do anymore betas. The hype is crazy right now. What happens if they release a beta and something sucks. It could kill their sales
[6:21:04] firewalltwitch: diablo endgame is always short in terms of content
[6:21:19] kryhavokk: @Keyastaron_ NDA...
[6:21:24] tylive52: yeah thats true wow has proven that since wrath
[6:21:28] WoW_StandalonE: D4 endgame is grinding same dungeons over and over, like D3

[6:21:45] spatiboy411: EU SERVER?

[6:22:48] nitroe: I love when games do that spontaneous stuff, APex Legends just came out one day with barely any announcements before
[6:22:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: wasp gonna one shot you
[6:22:53] Aquadriel: In d2, nobody likes act 3
[6:22:57] Sollice: What new the desert zone in D3 was the shit
[6:23:01] Lionheart_Swe: Chapter 3 sucked in d2
[6:23:01] Sollice: and the music was the best
[6:23:07] Keyastaron_: yea D2 and D3 did it LUL
[6:23:17] lithium364: remember the oneshot wasps in the desert

[6:23:25] Keyastaron_: i only played those games for trophies on the PS
[6:23:34] Aquadriel: Desert act 2 is basically a stapple of Diablo franchise at this point
[6:23:34] Sollice: Just wait and be excited
[6:23:45] Sollice: Thats why I dont like playing PTR for WOW everything gets spoiled
[6:23:59] Keyastaron_: loss in sales they already got our money to play the beta LUL
[6:24:28] Sollice: Yeah
[6:24:38] AnimalCrackers_19: Since Diablo IV has mmo aspect, we most likely have weekly maintenance. Sad
[6:24:39] PvtHudson093: LUL
[6:24:42] drmabusee: i just hope they dont release earlier.. i already planned everything
[6:24:47] Sollice: Its off

[6:25:04] Keglett: Will you be playing Wayfinder tow?
[6:25:11] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  have you seen the "trailer" for unrecord?

[6:26:21] Sollice: @ZeusDNA Several of the mods have been waiting literal years for D4
[6:26:24] Sollice: so we hyped
[6:27:19] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee you gonna play D2 - D3 to get ready for D4 ? :P
[6:27:28] Sayryn: World of Diablo Subathon
[6:27:31] ZeusDNA: @Sollice I remember picking up my D3 collectors box from gamestop with my buddy and heading back to our place to play and not getting into the game until like 4 am lmao
[6:27:35] Keyastaron_: i mean the story
[6:27:37] ZeusDNA: @Sollice Super stoked for this release
[6:27:54] Sollice: Yeah I hope the release is smooth, but if its not we will all be here chatting and hanging out

[6:29:37] firewalltwitch: raiding isnt popular in 2023, no way they add that
[6:29:38] Sollice: That could be cool @ZeusDNA Or Clan Halls
[6:29:55] Goncalvo: Where will the live stream for diablo iv be/
[6:30:00] firewalltwitch: raiding is the most dead game mode since WoW PvP @Towelliee
[6:30:03] Dred_Scythe: It's going to be more about details rather than broad stroke stuff, plus Season and Open Beta Learnings. So it won't be that much.
[6:30:09] Sollice: @firewalltwitch What? Weird take
[6:30:12] CobraKaifromHawaii: did they say when the first season is gonna start?
[6:30:12] AnimalCrackers_19: What is the best site for Diablo IV new? What time is this90min stream?
[6:30:21] ZeusDNA: @Sollice yeah I'm a solid fan of custom housing/guild/clan hall kind of things in games.

[6:30:40] PvtHudson093: Sure Jan
[6:30:54] firewalltwitch: im saying no way d4 adds raiding is all
[6:31:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the raiding Hall of Fame just picks random guilds to make it look like its real LUL
[6:31:17] Sollice: @firewalltwitch No what you said was raiding was a dead game mode
[6:31:25] Sollice: And thats 100% not correct
[6:31:29] 24sevn: please no raiding :(
[6:31:30] hearth__: @Towelliee Do you have a WoW playlist playing in the background?
[6:31:33] Sayryn: 8 man raids like Lost Ark would be sick
[6:31:37] PotbellyGoat: Trial of Style
[6:31:38] ZeusDNA: Yo Twitch's firewall be acting up. Someone made a weird policy. KEKW
[6:31:44] GatzuNL: do you want cola, fanta or sprite ?
[6:31:46] Aquadriel: i mean those mini raid events in diablo immortal were cool.. it was just other things that made the game dislikeable
[6:31:57] GatzuNL: same as you ask if someone likes raiding, m+ or achievements
[6:31:57] CloudPants8081: pvp Kappa
[6:32:00] firewalltwitch: it is @Sollice, barely any1 raids retail, so why would they waste time on it is all
[6:32:04] WoW_StandalonE: maybe they add raiding next seasons but not for season 1
[6:32:09] Zansteh: more classes :O
[6:32:14] Aquadriel: firewalltwitch who lied to you?
[6:32:31] peinen: @firewalltwitch any sources to back up this ridiculous claim?
[6:32:32] Sollice: @firewalltwitch What are you talking about? Where are you getting this from? Raiding RIGHT NOW may be slow in retail because the raid has been out for months
[6:32:36] veetz21: Endless waves arena mode , pinnacle bosses
[6:32:45] Lionheart_Swe: D4 are an arpg  for the first,  It aint an mmo,  just an open world
[6:32:58] PotbellyGoat: no, it's Trial of Style for real

[6:33:42] Wcvechten: Kappa
[6:33:49] 00joseph: they should create something new idk what tho
[6:33:49] Aquadriel: They should implement a mini vampire survivors in d4
[6:33:56] panterafan27: Guzu died on his warrior in ZF if you know who he is
[6:33:57] GatzuNL: Battle Royale i guess!

[6:34:31] Phoxzy: @Towelliee just got here, Have you seen the Oakland A's are moving to just off the Vegas Strip?
[6:34:32] firewalltwitch: @peinen yea google, classic and retail raid logging numbers are public from addons//acheivs lmao
[6:34:36] LJimbox: are Lost Ark raids fun?
[6:34:39] patti221: pet battles! ;)
[6:34:40] MaximumSerg: Diablo 4 Boat overworld
[6:34:54] dannyis1337: diablo immortal sorta had raids lol
[6:34:55] coldarmorTBG: didnt DI have raids you could que for?
[6:35:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: The clown raid is epic
[6:35:13] Zansteh: lost ark raids are the only fun thing there is
[6:35:27] Sollice: @firewalltwitch Raid logging ALWAYS happens towards mid to end of raid tier. That is not a good indicator of raiding being a dead mode, it's an indication of people being tired of doing the same raid lol
[6:35:29] Aquadriel: firewalltwitch you know the majority of casual raiders dont bother on logging? what you see on wclogs is just a fraction of total population raiding.
[6:35:31] Krazie_J: As someone who‚Äôs never touched WOW. I‚Äôd like raids in D4
[6:36:14] panterafan27: he was like 44
[6:36:27] killswiitch: Raids with no "holy trinity" is just weird.
[6:36:30] HaxzorJimDuggan: you won't find me in the pvp zone
[6:36:33] BobbyBones: @Towelliee look at all the hunter deaths in a row
[6:36:45] Xirmak: d3 had it and it didnt catch on

[6:36:59] Sollice: @killswiitch Yeah I agree. I am long time gamer though and trinity is my normal
[6:36:59] drmabusee: but d4 pvp has loot sooo
[6:37:04] butt3r_gaming: division 1 darkzone was amazing.
[6:37:21] 00joseph: lol
[6:37:23] Meliea_EU: D4 is in 2 hours?
[6:37:24] firewalltwitch: @Sollice total raiders is still small, i liek raiding, but most wow players dont raid, who lied to u
[6:37:30] falldrgn: and he didn't respect the 1v1.. report him

[6:39:02] firewalltwitch: @Aquadriel for WoW, not diablo is what im saying, i like raids, relax, but its player base is tiny, casuals dotn raid
[6:39:12] Meliea_EU: D4 devs sure know about the importance of "endgame"
[6:39:13] epiczplz: why does every game that comes out have to have pvp i dont it?
[6:39:18] Keglett: division 3 announcement?
[6:39:54] HeavyMetta: Well the numbers of raid/dungs are also not that high so why no pvp ...wows strength is being a all people show..
[6:40:04] Aquadriel: firewalltwitch if they develop it like wow mythic difficulty is DoA, but a more accessible difficulty has the potential to be another pillar for the game.
[6:40:08] firewalltwitch: most popular games are all pvp, MMORPG games are the exceptions
[6:40:13] ZeusDNA: I played a game way back when called Conquer Online that had a decent PvP system. You could kill other players anywhere other than one location. Killing players would give PK points. At a certain threshold you could be attacked by other players and killed with a chance to drop gear. The players who attacked the PKer wouldn't get PK points.
[6:40:16] kajun_predator: i wish i had the same willpower to play any form of classic rn :(
[6:40:21] rbgdev: I only PvP in games
[6:40:32] Mecabeast: I think generally dev time for pvp is cheaper than pve which is probably why alot of companies go for some pvp to fill gap between pve content
[6:40:32] Sayryn: If people want PvP go play Dark and Darker...oh wait LOL
[6:40:37] adxx: there are games that are just better for pvp content. battle royales, Rust, survival games, etc.
[6:40:40] Aquadriel: Ajaexx thank god, IRL PvP sucks.

[6:41:08] epiczplz: i have played since release and have pvp only handful of times
[6:41:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's hard to know for sure about the participation numbers for raiding and PvP, but they are both not large percentages
[6:41:15] Meliea_EU: i went from playing alot pvp in wow to playing none anymore, im done^^
[6:41:16] CloudPants8081: wintergrasp was fun xd
[6:41:17] dannyis1337: thats being generous
[6:41:17] falldrgn: PVP is the feral druid of content..
[6:41:25] Moose184: BFA open world pvp assaults were fire though
[6:41:31] HonestPhilosophy: makes up a bigger part of viewership though
[6:41:42] OpiumHC: pet battle might be more popular than pvp
[6:41:42] futomara01: pvp is for mark of honor to buy transmog
[6:41:43] JakloomGaming770: 95% of what i do in retail is pvp lol, im def the minority though
[6:41:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: The highest PvP participation in recent times was the start of Shadowlands when PvE people were doing it for better gear, that's over
[6:41:55] firewalltwitch: in legion they publicly showed every1 who got 1550 achievs, only like 17k people had it in NA, including alts lol
[6:42:00] robbo1010: robbo1010 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[6:42:13] firewalltwitch: wow pvp is nothing, i love solo shuffle though
[6:42:13] 00joseph: man but that pvp gear looking better than most pve gear
[6:42:13] mavericks312: PvP is basically dead on retail
[6:42:18] L__E__A__F: wow pvp just feels clunky, if i wanna pvp i'm just gonna play a moba or an fps
[6:42:20] HonestPhilosophy: I mean more viewership % then player
[6:42:41] rbgdev: To be fair this is a pve stream, it‚Äôs not fully objective
[6:42:43] obesekid: !warrior
[6:42:44] Moobot: @obesekid https://t.co/VggfVNqVhU
[6:42:50] HonestPhilosophy: I mean Xaryu is popping off, but he is doing hardcore so no pvp lol
[6:43:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: Venruki is a great streamer for PvP
[6:43:19] TheUnknowing: pvp is definitely more fun to watch than actually play lol
[6:43:31] Sayryn: Baj is super funny to watch/listen too
[6:43:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ziqo is great, too
[6:43:42] kajun_predator: but even those guys have maybe 1/4 of the viewership as any mediocre raider who has solid content
[6:43:46] WoW_StandalonE: he is straeming each day
[6:43:58] BoldrinXX: Ven streams everyday lmao
[6:44:04] falldrgn: but hes good.. lol
[6:44:12] 00joseph: lol true

[6:44:42] Meliea_EU: in the end its a matter of taste we all got different, im full into crafting and wow offers too little vs other mmo
[6:45:23] kajun_predator: after leveling 3 toons in retail in a week from 1-70, def cant do that sht in wow classic. way too slow for me
[6:45:37] Keglett: cdew a family man
[6:45:41] Mueller_Gaming: @Towelliee get the addon leatrix maps bro i promise you'll love it

[6:50:11] buffkenobi: retail > classic. not even close
[6:50:31] FreeMont: the problem of retail is a toxic community IMHO
[6:50:35] WoW_StandalonE: @buffkenobi not at the moment
[6:50:40] L__E__A__F: yes LUL
[6:50:40] Brodih_: its just a fresh way to play a game they love
[6:50:41] FreeMont: on EU, dunno on NA
[6:50:42] MackPlays: It‚Äôs literally the same game just added content. WoW players are dumb being split
[6:50:50] Sayryn: LIke going to the races to see the crashes
[6:50:50] Aidler: that‚Äôs true
[6:50:55] L__E__A__F: hardcore is nascar for nerds
[6:51:02] falldrgn: so its like watching jack ass.. were waiting on them to die?
[6:51:04] firewalltwitch: leveling is the best part of a MMO for a casual, its easy to watch
[6:51:07] Epicsapphire1988: yup
[6:51:08] Gr4nger: classic content is less sleeper then retail
[6:51:19] Aidler: Quin is a prime example‚Ä¶ lol
[6:51:19] 00joseph: lmao sounds kinda messed up

[6:51:34] EnterPlayerX: Story of my life
[6:51:39] Jukatax: I wouldn't, I do watch you because of you not the game twist
[6:51:41] Tsheridan05: I think more people watch classic because they can RELATE to it
[6:51:43] adxx: Xaryu also attracts an audience because of his clips doing risky shit. He does a lot of Elite quests and otherwise NON-soloable content that only a mage can probably pull off. @Towelliee
[6:51:43] firewalltwitch: i dont watch wow content anymore, i just watch @Towelliee
[6:51:45] L__E__A__F: hardcore is interesting because the worse a streamer is at classic, the better the stream is LUL

[6:51:55] BubblePriest: For me, it's less about the death, and more about the decisions made near death. Where careful skill meets panic.
[6:51:58] Gengisman: Its a bit like the rocket. You want them to succeed. But if it blows up then thats interesting too
[6:52:00] Keyastaron_: WoW should have HC like D3 does
[6:52:19] butt3r_gaming: i made it first character to almost 22 and i was lucky at best not to die a few times
[6:52:22] DhioGaming: Towellie you hear Guzu RIP his 44 warrior
[6:52:27] FreeMont: below the stairs

[6:52:39] Keyastaron_: 4Head you passed it
[6:52:42] BubblePriest: basement in kitchen behind table
[6:52:45] drmabusee: @Keyastaron_ i think wow should have several gamemodes
[6:52:59] Aidler: I have no illusions there. people like to see the streamer die in game and rage

[6:53:44] Gengisman: You need to give him some ale i think and as he moves away then you loot the barrel
[6:53:46] abracka_: talk to the innkeeper, buy the thunder brew, give it to the NPC and then loot the barrel behind him
[6:53:52] Kinetikx1315: So does that mean you cant die in a dungeon and be rezzed by your grp member?
[6:53:53] Brodih_: buy the ale from vendor and give it to him
[6:53:53] Richezdude: in basement
