[0:34:52] Motivess: since WoD each expansion has only had one, maybe two good lvling zones, but shadowlands is definitely one of the worst lvling experiences in the game, hence why they're not using it for the new player 10 to 60 experience lol

[2:10:19] Evoca85: @Elson_Vi the hyper competitive RWF, AWC, MDI players have a reason to complain when balance is broken. They have loud voices and it leaks into the community. But I agree, I enjoy the break/fix cycle as long as it's fast.

[2:11:57] FranciscoTheMage: yes m+ does remind me of diablo
[2:11:59] Subjektive: some people got some crazy takes lol
[2:12:09] im_your_innerdemon: @Motivess you dont need to do m+  wdym
[2:12:15] CasualTryhrd: @fractaleyes it can be. a good healer is a great asset. I was a great healer in Wrath on Paladin, but as soon as they introduced Holy Power and more mechanics my smol brain got fried.
[2:12:19] Llamatude: if M+ goes away 90% of the player base goes with it
[2:12:19] Naethix: when is Alpha?
[2:12:28] SilkeySmooth: all m+ needs is a queue system for the lower m0-m5 to bring more players in
[2:12:34] FranciscoTheMage: apparently it started yesterday
[2:12:41] Tuturs: lets see how this m+ "bring back oldies" will do
[2:12:48] ar_melol: @CasualTryhrd i liked it until they forced paladins to become melee healers and removed holy radiance lol

[2:13:05] DogShep: @FranciscoTheMage someone is lying to you ;)
[2:13:05] 91Niki: Now we‚Äôre just pulling numbers out of our asses LUL
[2:13:06] Suzuyuh: I wouldnt really call Mythic plus being dungeon relevancy.
[2:13:12] smashwow: @Tuturs agreed. i'm not a fan of the split they're wanting to do
[2:13:13] Motivess: but dungeons have never been fun enough to run 100+ times
[2:13:14] echoingtruth: what about a mythic + without the timer? just higher difficulty each level?
[2:13:19] FranciscoTheMage: huh
[2:13:19] mario32: how come Planet Calypso game is not popular you can make real money if u play it but u need to spend real money to play it
[2:13:22] CasualTryhrd: @Cazapx it just kept getting more and more complicated and "fit" into a role. I just wanted to make HP bars stay green.
[2:13:27] goosejamss: watching towelliee makes me want to start a new toon
[2:13:29] ForeverCarried: I got an invite to come back to WoW... It's been awhile.  Where is the best and safe way to get your addons now?
[2:13:30] Niksen_99: Only way blizzard would lose 90% of their playerbase is if they only made fresh servers for Dragonflight/wotlk lol
[2:13:33] ar_melol: 22@cas
[2:13:34] TompsonX: @echoingtruth You can already do it without the timer
[2:13:38] Thoreya: i think the pool of 8 dungeons is not enough
[2:13:39] ar_melol: @CasualTryhrd yep lol
[2:13:44] FranciscoTheMage: @DogShep read @Towelliee !alpha command
[2:13:48] smashwow: exactly S1 is new dungeons for the xpac. S2+ is a mix i definitely could get behind that
[2:13:54] Llamatude: @91Niki of course! lol i mean i was being conservative. The real number is closer to 110%.. but i figured 90 was a good number :P
[2:14:10] Subjektive: fresh wotlk servers make sense though, the economy on some servers is borked
[2:14:13] CasualTryhrd: I will say the best WoW players I've ever played with have been Healers though.
[2:14:16] FranciscoTheMage: the more i keep seeing of D4 gameplay im loving it
[2:14:25] FranciscoTheMage: i want that game out like tomorrow
[2:14:26] Suzuyuh: I feel like they could do twelve other things to make "dungeon relevancy" better, mythic plus is kinda helpful but idk Its all kinda just gimped with the way they approach world building as a whole.
[2:14:49] Oriion_: What are the requirements for timewalking?
[2:15:07] JayGodd: @ForeverCarried Cursed forge is a good place
[2:15:17] justi_86: They just need to make mythic 0-4 not timed for those who want more challenge than heroics but not deal with the time dungeon.
[2:15:18] smashwow: @suzuyuh not sure M+ is suppose to be a world building tool
[2:15:20] Tuturs: @smashwow yeah, im not a fan aswell, but we know that the m+ becomes kinda too repetitive, its nice to have a rotation of some sort
[2:15:20] ForeverCarried: @JayGodd Thanks

[2:16:30] WhiteU: @Towelliee what are those dragons wings?
[2:16:37] Suzuyuh: @smashwow I really just mean by the fact dungeons a whole are story based usually, so i figure outside of replaying them there should be a better way.
[2:16:40] Kinghorn: eventually you run out of use for badges
[2:16:41] FranciscoTheMage: alliance scum?????
[2:16:48] Subjektive: <--- alliance scum
[2:16:59] BunnyMountain: i was so happy for the cross faction now i'm infesting my alliance guild with vulpera :)
[2:17:02] Niksen_99: Towellie was once a dwarf scum FeelsBadMan
[2:17:06] smashwow: let's be honest here. when we play RPGs for the story. we play on a lower difficulty setting. max difficulty setting is meant as a challenge. M+ is kinda like that difficulty setting
[2:17:08] Lasidor: LFR being gone would be awesome lol
[2:17:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: I just want to see the mythic keys be less punishing, those things don't need to deplete

[2:17:31] FranciscoTheMage: how quickly we forget where we came from
[2:17:37] grimginder: LOS em
[2:17:42] Naethix: The timed aspect killed it for a lot of people. At least socially its always a friction thing
[2:17:43] grimginder: Down by where you came in
[2:17:50] ObsidianHealer: You CC'd one and LOS'd the others iirc

[2:17:53] FranciscoTheMage: Something CALLED CC which no one seems to know how to do anymore
[2:18:01] Motivess: @smashwow but that didn't usually involve running the same thing over and over and over ad nauseum
[2:18:06] BE3njo: @weirdo_dude dude u just get - 1 if u dont do it in time, legion was rough when your whole key got fcked up this is good now
[2:18:21] grimginder: The next group you can LOS at the top of the stairs
[2:18:41] Velashen: I think the barrier for entry should be a little easier in the beginning. Zero through five probably shouldn‚Äôt have a timer. Maybe even make it Queued

[2:24:21] fat_european0: Ngl, I miss the super speedrunning aspect of Challenge Modes, but there wasn't much variety
[2:24:37] smashwow: @Motivess then by that standard it's the same. you're running a pool of dungeons or killing a pool of bosses. same thing.

[2:28:34] Mr_Hasselhoff: I like cata dungeons and the first few raids
[2:28:34] Motivess: wrath dungs are not easy when you first hit 80 and starting heroics,  also the 3 released pre ICC were well designed, fun, and challenging
[2:28:47] Lasidor: That air one you just did was intense, there was SO much CC going on in that dungeon.

[4:26:19] smashwow: @NieIas 1 year**
[4:26:22] mario32: you guys  know whats up someone from a game bought something for 300k you can make rela mmoney by playing it
[4:26:24] Frenaris: DF not even close, it's next year for sure
[4:26:26] mario32: real money
[4:26:28] Gingerprimer: ppl still seems to think DF is this year
[4:26:38] Exxcar: I'm just surprised they haven't opened pre-orders yet
[4:26:40] Mecabeast: max was thinking about 4-6 weeks till alpha
[4:26:54] Exxcar: @Mecabeast No way
[4:27:02] Exxcar: Oh wait, TILL alpha
[4:27:06] Exxcar: I misread that XD
[4:27:06] smashwow: you can go look at the timelines from announcement to launch. it's an avg of like 300 days from the announcement
[4:27:11] ErosnPsyche: " i dont know" = i know but i dont wanna say
[4:27:29] Gingerprimer: @Exxcar if launch of full game in July that shit would suck so hard
[4:27:32] Kaoticc1: It was annoying how they released Shadowlands and Classic Naxx at the same time, so I'm hoping they space it a bit this time between Wotlk and DF
[4:27:47] Exxcar: @Gingerprimer Huh?
[4:27:52] NieIas: i mean bfa alpha started in feb 2018 and it launched 6 months later in august
[4:27:57] NieIas: it could happen
[4:28:34] Exxcar: At the end of the day, if they can I think the dev team wants to take their time with DF
[4:28:36] Mecabeast: sl was what april alpha into November release?
[4:28:45] croppeast: Naxx has gotten shafted on all its releases. OG Naxx got released a bit to close to Outland, and the in classic it released with Shadow Lands. Poor Naxx :(
[4:29:23] smashwow: @NieIas it was announced on Nov3 2017, release in Aug of 2018. that's more than 6 months
[4:29:46] croppeast: True. You can polish a turd over a long time.. its shiny, but its just a shiny turd
[4:29:46] Barret: it depends on scope i suppose
[4:29:50] KeidooTV: trueeee
[4:29:51] Gingerprimer: Yeha like ppl gave feedback on covenants not like that changed
[4:30:08] Daarksyde: wise words from the Towel
