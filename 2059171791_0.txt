[0:20:52] Wujoh: one of these days he has to put in the wrong day
[0:20:56] alejandro7com: Nice stream! It's like a virtual party, but with better snacks and no awkward small talk.
[0:20:57] LemmingsOCE: Uber uber elder would be a good watch if you want to see one of the bosses ben killed
[0:21:18] antipheonixna: put (shame) when u feel shame
[0:21:24] Kalamazi: @devz_5 <3

[0:22:31] Archmage_Michael: so you aren't get up at 9 and prepare the stream for 4-5 hours?  now I'm disillusioned
[0:22:38] ghwosttoast: hey whats the best rogue spec
[0:22:39] Hoaw: "guys is x spec meta"? @Maximum
[0:22:42] Warfreak4: Hey Max! What tream do you play for?
[0:22:46] taanzfour: is this mythic
[0:22:53] riba000: max what do you think of the current state of wow?
[0:23:16] sirch1: we're getting flying around veldraken
[0:23:20] dustin_handsupdb: The fact that it happens when your hand isn't touching the mic indicates it's a capacitance thing. Have you tried turning off one of your monitors, or another machine in the room? Something inside them could've shorted and been making mad noise. It could be as simple as swapping plugs for the device causing the problem. I mean everything on a UPS though would probably do a lot if it's not too much load...
[0:23:23] alejandro7com: Hey Max, your stream is so lit, it's like a disco party in here! üï∫üíÉ
[0:23:25] LuciFeariUm: best stats to heal vdh spriest fury warr arms warr in a +3 205 ilvl?
[0:23:26] its_WiKeD: its a good time with a squad
[0:23:26] Wheva: Actually Max your brain is an enigma and I have no clue what to expect each stream
[0:23:28] SirScizor2020: Yea, WoW flavored just chatting stream
[0:23:32] slickrazor2: @Hoaw honestly i dont want meta I just wanna know if people will want me in their group Sadge
[0:23:32] guynormally: the game looks sick
[0:23:33] its_WiKeD: its like 40k war feels
[0:23:36] SirScizor2020: what i come for
[0:23:52] LemmingsOCE: Can you watch one of Bens boss kills and try to figure out the mechanics?
[0:24:02] its_WiKeD: you guys will have a good time
[0:24:10] yama_class: Skull and Bones on TUE?
[0:24:10] its_WiKeD: it can get crazy with higher difficulties.
[0:24:11] kelly_mac06: it's very Starship Troopers feel
[0:24:14] castorlyte: I only watch Max during RWF usually, but your youtube content has convinced me here on this fine saturday
[0:24:14] kelly_mac06: tons of fun
[0:24:27] its_WiKeD: i dont think we are done, i was thinking of playing today possibly
[0:24:51] ciggyman: fronk stonks
[0:25:05] Zarroe: yo
[0:25:22] Lego17: yes
[0:25:24] TimNanook: incognito tabs save lives :)
[0:25:28] cyberklinos: yes
[0:25:37] Archmage_Michael: @castorlyte only here because Adin Ross is offline atm
[0:25:40] alejandro7com: Hey, this stream is so entertaining, it's like watching a group of penguins trying to dance ballet! üòÑ
[0:25:49] slowdkay: my sleep number only warms the feet area
[0:25:56] LemmingsOCE: Warm bed is crazy, cold bed is bis
[0:26:02] Lego17: did you know the optimal temp for sleeping though is 65 degrees
[0:26:06] sirch1: man i need my shit super cold to sleep
[0:26:09] Powzoar: @Maximum Are you going to play Helldivers 2? I feel like you and Shroud would be great in it
[0:26:11] jitsuttv: Cold bed is 100% bis
[0:26:16] fat_european0: Isn't it bad for your balls?
[0:26:23] oresties: show me a price
[0:26:44] fkboibob: i have a gel cool memory foam bed. its amazing
[0:26:44] minikori: right, an alarm
[0:26:50] riba000: so even if you die in sleep it keeps you warm
[0:26:52] lol_dante_: max how do i become a professional singer like you?
[0:26:52] greyst: I would make that bitch so cold and wrap up in 3 blankets
[0:27:01] LemmingsOCE: Slam on one of Bens boss kills
[0:27:04] jitsuttv: holy shit, 2g's for that thing? Yeah no way
[0:27:06] sirch1: warm up your body for the zombies
[0:27:11] lostcol0ny: It tracks your sleep patterns and stuff too right?
[0:27:27] LemmingsOCE: Last Epoch?
[0:27:30] LemmingsOCE: its a banger
[0:27:33] Joneim: Last epoch Home cooked builds are great
[0:27:36] its_WiKeD: i thought it didn't have multiplayer?
[0:27:40] its_WiKeD: am i just out of the loop
[0:27:41] alejandro7com: If I had a dollar for every time I got distracted, I wish I had a puppy.
[0:27:46] Joneim: @its_WiKeD It got it last year
[0:27:48] minikori: it has multiplayer
[0:27:50] zolito5: it does
[0:27:51] LemmingsOCE: It does
[0:27:51] elefnot: w
[0:27:54] Joneim: It got Multiplayer last year
[0:27:56] its_WiKeD: @Joneim oh dang, that's sick
[0:27:57] Dowson91: it does
[0:27:57] boosisme: it does
[0:28:00] m_dep: last epoch is really good, almost as good as PoE
[0:28:00] or3g: ima play last epoche
[0:28:09] Joneim: 4 i think
[0:28:09] LemmingsOCE: 4 man
[0:28:13] GelatoSquid: 4 player
[0:28:23] its_WiKeD: i just haven't followed in a minute, heard really good things about LE though
[0:28:31] Joneim: HOLY
[0:28:46] Archmage_Michael: I installed a separate AC/Heating for my bedroom to control the temp independently from the rest of the house. that helps also a lot
[0:28:51] LemmingsOCE: The Last Epoch trade system is really nice approach to trading
[0:29:00] GelatoSquid: it's pretty fun tbh, good middleground between d4 and POE
[0:29:03] Im_anDe: when and why did you swap to calling people by their irl name instead of their gamer name? @Maximum
[0:29:05] Zizonyx: eavLurk
[0:29:20] harrybps: I have 100 hours into last epoch and I'm not even a big ARPG fan, it's great
[0:29:24] Tuoppa: the devs seem pretty Based
[0:29:34] LemmingsOCE: For sure a middle ground
[0:29:39] harrybps: it's definitely like that
[0:29:43] m_dep: its nearly as good as PoE
[0:29:46] Joneim: Last epoch self cooked build creation + self finding items is fantastic
[0:29:47] br3v4n: It 100% fills that gap
[0:29:50] downdard: does the game have a solid  endgame?
[0:29:55] totemic_: xdding
[0:30:01] totemic_: i play a lot of both
[0:30:02] MrAndersen_: that wasnt my impression it just seems to have a way better learning curve than poe
[0:30:12] Icydeadppl23: i do like my jingly keys...
[0:30:15] its_WiKeD: we need a middle child
[0:30:22] GelatoSquid: I'd say it's still complex but less punishing
[0:30:46] Wakeuphate: the older i get the more i want jingly keys games LUL
[0:30:55] GelatoSquid: you can watch the ziz video on Falconer it's awesome
[0:31:15] JackOfAllApocalypses: I mean it sounds like an insult
[0:31:24] BigSatchel: Not meant bad
[0:31:29] BigSatchel: Don't take it bad
[0:31:32] LemmingsOCE: Slam a Ben boss kill video from the PoE event
[0:31:34] Joneim: how dare u RAGEY
[0:31:39] alejandro7com: Nice stream, Maximum! Did you switch to using real names because you're tired of people hiding behind their gamer names? üòÑ
[0:31:43] riba000: can poe be played on consoles?
[0:31:45] its_WiKeD: PoE is the goat in my mind but it takes a certain of level of commitment every season.
[0:31:53] skar4317: you are not you just have to try it
[0:31:55] BigTheTank: D4s really good when i just wanna vibe for like 2 hours
[0:32:06] thoromyr19: been playing d3 alot lately actually
[0:32:13] totemic_: the combat in d4 feels incredible
[0:32:22] kiblinix: d3 was good for the weekend
[0:32:26] zysmos: They just like to shit on blizzard
[0:32:31] m_dep: items and gear in diablo is just so disapointing, that's the main reason poe owns. Gear is actually exciting.
[0:32:38] kitty0chi: d3 was/is the pinnacle of what we have as a fun game. like forget balance, forget sense, lets just have fun.
[0:32:51] taxiidk: ben won the guantlet today
[0:32:52] Joneim: "really good at that game" is maybe the understatement of the year
[0:32:52] GelatoSquid: oh did you see Ben won the Gauntlet last night?
[0:32:55] McFrumple: never loved how the gameplay feels in poe
[0:32:58] its_WiKeD: oh dude, mapping IS the game
[0:33:01] elirank9: Poe 2 to the rescue
[0:33:05] SavageFromSpace: yeah maps is where it is
[0:33:09] harrybps: relatable
[0:33:10] LucasSterling_: Ben is the PoE goat
[0:33:13] alejandro7com: Ben's boss kill video is so epic, it's like he's playing Path of Exile in real life! #POELife
[0:33:14] Muspel: I think most people take like six failed starts in different leagues before PoE clicks with them
[0:33:15] dubbyatt: garf
[0:33:15] DunzoCD: yeah PoE doesnt truely open up til you finish your atlas
[0:33:16] m_dep: just have Ben give you a build for some fun trickster shit and you'll have a blast
[0:33:17] its_WiKeD: you're not, you just need some help. There's nothing like a new season of PoE and racing to maps to get big money and funding for gear
[0:33:18] Joneim: I dont think anyone is too dumb for the game, but forcing it isnt gonna do you any favors either
[0:33:19] LemmingsOCE: Trying to learn everything at once in PoE doesnt work
[0:33:21] its_WiKeD: then crafting is just another level
[0:33:33] totemic_: maps is where it is, unless you specifically do all the endgame that isn't mapping xdd
[0:33:44] riba000: it takes like 3000 hours just to start playing poe, it's a very big commitment
[0:33:58] zolito5: Las tepoch has the best crafting and item trading/ssf ever
[0:33:58] LemmingsOCE: They want to slow the game down with PoE2 by the looks of it
[0:33:59] almostdps: PoE2 looks like a game i wont like, hopefully they actually keep updating PoE 1
[0:34:01] sirch1: The seasons are really fun in PoE
[0:34:04] klappe92: Mondays garf
[0:34:07] Wakeuphate: Yeah, i've like 350 hours in poe and I've barely done anything in it, i always peter out around maps
[0:34:07] its_WiKeD: PoE is like the tarkov of ARPGS
[0:34:42] kiblinix: factorio vibe
[0:34:43] yama_class: sound like WoW with extra steps
[0:34:44] drchemtutor: escape from tarkov
[0:34:49] GelatoSquid: POE, OSRS, Tarkov all have the same kinda vibe
[0:34:52] alejandro7com: Looks like you're having a blast in the stream! Just remember, in Path of Exile, the real endgame is trying to understand the game's skill tree!
[0:35:03] zysmos: PoE is bad at getting new players to understand how the game works
[0:35:03] reggiepowa: Aware
[0:35:05] DunzoCD: PoE is unapologetically complex, they like having that niche
[0:35:07] rngbtw_xd: and every raid is current so u need to clear those too
[0:35:10] riba000: good lord imagine all of that in one season
[0:35:11] Ionized4: LOGIN
[0:35:12] kitty0chi: sounds depressing
[0:35:19] TheHunter90: sup boys,just got my leggy on a random alt and i use it just for my main surv hunter tmog
[0:35:19] ThreesFG: Somewhere thd is excited
[0:35:20] MrAndersen_: yea imagine if Lost Ark had the borrowed power from WoW when it launched LUL maximum
[0:35:27] Archmage_Michael: That is THD's wet dream
[0:35:31] Joneim: The nice part about Poe now is you can just slam maps and ignore content you dont understand / dont wanna do
[0:35:39] LemmingsOCE: I think Rax and DM have got a lot of new people to play PoE
[0:35:43] SavageFromSpace: Kind of, but generally while it exists you dont have to interact with it
[0:35:43] riba000: imagine logging on and doing your chores from last 4 expansions
[0:35:56] dustin_handsupdb: @riba000 id shoot myself
[0:35:57] SavageFromSpace: if you try to engage with every mechanics straight away yeah the burden is huge
[0:35:59] LucasSterling_: in PoE u can customize the type of content u want to do
[0:36:02] Wakeuphate: @Joneim i hadnt played since they added that map tree and it's soooo nice
[0:36:08] Joneim: @Joneim Fuck yeah
[0:36:17] DunzoCD: its more like you get to pick your favorite mechanics and focus on those
[0:36:30] alejandro7com: If I had a dollar for every time I got distracted, I wish I had a puppy.
[0:36:38] its_WiKeD: i dont think that would happen tbh
[0:36:41] Joneim: Thats optimal though, hyper focusing on 1-3 mechanics is how people play
[0:36:47] LemmingsOCE: You have to drip feed yourself content when you are new in PoE
[0:36:52] Squats3: maps and uber bosses are kinda the whole game. everything else is just different methods to get or craft gear
[0:36:52] dustin_handsupdb: @Maximum shouldn't you change your category to cooking? It's basically your stream at this point
[0:36:53] reggiepowa: only 3k years too late for chess
[0:36:58] guynormally: you'd have to study so fkn much for chess
[0:36:58] SavageFromSpace: The way they have it set  up now with the map is you tend to go all the way into certain mechanics, so you choose that you'd prefer your crucible or your legion legendary
[0:37:02] Joneim: The atlas tree rewards you for blocking mechanics you havent invested in
[0:37:04] its_WiKeD: like, finishing the campaign is just the start of the game. mapping has been made easier also
[0:37:05] riba000: yes you have to start at like 2 years old
[0:37:06] Brohdin: You have to start chess at age 5 basically
[0:37:14] miraagex: its fascinating how old chess is and still is a good game
[0:37:21] its_WiKeD: its not as bad as you think BUT it does require learning
[0:37:30] LemmingsOCE: One of your mates is the GOAT of poe, you have him to help you through it

[0:37:32] Gh0stiesEU: having someone play with you is extremely helpful
[0:37:34] DunzoCD: Max and Ben poe streams would be lit
[0:37:38] skar4317: you should try it when a new league starts I think its the perfect game for you
[0:37:40] Ionized4: theres like nothing going on in wow for a while this is the best time to learn poe
[0:37:40] LucasSterling_: first time playing HCSSF PoE and fighting a boss is fucking hype and so fun
[0:37:44] LemmingsOCE: PauseChamp
[0:37:52] riba000: imagine they drop like chess 2 with a 100 tier battle pass and seasonal changes to the board
[0:37:59] flabstv: who are you co-streaming MDI with?
[0:38:03] Kadlynn: Im cirrently playing LE its really good imo
[0:38:10] its_WiKeD: @LucasSterling_ that's just massive balls, Ive never done HC let alone SSF
[0:38:12] LemmingsOCE: Max can you watch Bens Uber Maven kill video, would be cool to see if you can figure out the fight
[0:38:15] reggiepowa: thats more stuff for casuals
[0:38:22] SavageFromSpace: we back to alpha dragonriding in dun morogh
[0:38:24] Joneim: BG3 full chaos angle
[0:38:39] nykkou55: is there a release date for 10.2.6? just got here
[0:38:44] dansthehunter: I'm so ready for Alpha. Gonna be hyped
[0:38:46] Squats3: prolly youtube
[0:38:47] Joneim: Oh god
[0:38:49] LemmingsOCE: Go on poe racing and hover over the points
[0:38:50] Joneim: With his reactions too
[0:38:51] kiblinix: itll be on racing site
[0:38:53] skar4317: you can go to poe racing and find it there
[0:38:55] LucasSterling_: @its_WiKeD SSF is so muh fun, even softcore, but it takes a lot of time
[0:38:59] LemmingsOCE: You can find it on Poe-racing
[0:38:59] Ionized4: Tink
[0:39:13] coleslam: coleslam subscribed with Prime. 
[0:39:15] LemmingsOCE: Thats it
[0:39:16] its_WiKeD: @LucasSterling_ always wanted to do SSF just never had the patience
[0:39:17] Joneim: Uber maven yeah
[0:39:25] GelatoSquid: his Feared kill is also psychotic
[0:39:30] Joneim: That sounds fun
[0:39:39] CladeusXE: did u know elon musk did a d4 stream
[0:39:53] Hred5: what the fuck was those talents
[0:39:53] LionButLeon: WAYTOODANK
[0:39:54] LucasSterling_: @its_WiKeD yeah, unless you're at Ben's level of knowledge, its gonna take u at least a month to get to endgame
[0:39:55] Hred5: ??????????????????????????????
[0:39:55] LemmingsOCE: Already so overwhelmed LMAO
[0:39:56] SavageFromSpace: oh god uber mavens mechanics are psychotic
[0:39:57] dubbyatt: garf check
[0:39:57] Shastoos: theres random map bosses that are in the fight
[0:39:58] pokirane: WAYTOODANK
[0:40:06] its_WiKeD: its not as bad at is looks I promise
[0:40:06] Squats3: the end points are the only parts that matterish
[0:40:08] Aosin_: just click life and damage
[0:40:12] Hred5: this just looks so overwhelming
[0:40:16] Joneim: You gotta take it one step at a time PepeLaugh
[0:40:17] thoromyr19: watching you play might finally get me to dive into this too
[0:40:25] m_dep: most of the nodes are just like "+5 strength" its really much mroe intuitive than you would think
[0:40:25] Vesamora: I would never play this game based on that skill tree alone
[0:40:29] Clox9: its not that bad tbh once you know a bit
[0:40:33] antipheonixna: its just every talent page on one tree
[0:40:43] GrimFandango: wait what did Ben do? just tuning in
[0:40:47] Hred5: WAYTOODANK
[0:40:49] GrimFandango: is this some sort of world first cook?
[0:40:49] pokirane: it's prokel Pog
[0:40:55] its_WiKeD: @LucasSterling_ i've played a ton of PoE but just normal PoE though. SSF is definitely knowing what works on a deep end i feel like
[0:40:56] Joneim: He is playing a poison build, so it ramps
[0:41:00] LucasSterling_: yeah dont think this is uber
[0:41:23] SavageFromSpace: @LucasSterling_ it is
[0:41:33] Themselves: degen doesnt go away , it's uber
[0:41:39] leubinator: the circles are gauntlet only mod
[0:41:40] m_dep: the gauntlet adds teh red circles, normally there are 0
[0:41:40] Squats3: what build is he playing here?
[0:41:40] Joneim: The Red circles and mechanics are Gauntlet speicific
[0:41:40] LemmingsOCE: Those red circles are ONLY on this POE event
[0:41:40] GelatoSquid: those fire red circles are exclusive to the gauntlet
[0:41:41] Gh0stiesEU: theres none in normal uber :)
[0:41:43] Shastoos: those red circles are a gauntlet mod
[0:41:53] harris01_: the heck is going on
[0:41:53] LemmingsOCE: Yeah
[0:41:55] GelatoSquid: yes
[0:41:56] Aosin_: GGG works with him to do it
[0:41:56] DunzoCD: YEP
[0:41:57] m_dep: YEP
[0:41:57] Joneim: Yes, GGG worked with him
[0:42:00] Seskass: yeah, gauntlet is made to be much harder
[0:42:00] Squats3: thats really sweet
[0:42:00] m_dep: maybe devs maybe Ziz idk
[0:42:01] SavageFromSpace: GGG helps him
[0:42:01] Shastoos: yes and ggg helps
[0:42:01] GelatoSquid: POE devs helped
[0:42:05] mega2g: yes
[0:42:15] its_WiKeD: max's PoE arc starts soon
[0:42:17] Squats3: brain
[0:42:21] LemmingsOCE: Kinda
[0:42:23] Joneim: There's 2 intermissions
[0:42:23] DunzoCD: its a big brain
[0:42:23] m_dep: YEP
[0:42:26] Squats3: yar
[0:42:31] Ionized4: @its_WiKeD the ubers will get him hooked for sure
[0:42:37] dubbyatt: ziz and ggg were pretty sure this would be impossible
[0:42:42] LemmingsOCE: Can he figure out the main mechanic
[0:42:43] its_WiKeD: @Ionized4 idk if he even knows how many there are
[0:42:48] its_WiKeD: @Ionized4 so many bosses that are sickkk
[0:43:06] Ionized4: max about to LOGIN
[0:43:06] LemmingsOCE: I think Simon would be really good at this mechanic
[0:43:09] Squats3: wait you have to kill shit while doing the memory game? no wonder quin isnt doing this
[0:43:10] pokirane: SCHIZO
[0:43:14] Shastoos: its a memory game
[0:43:27] Aosin_: simon says
[0:43:30] m_dep: simon says
[0:43:31] LucasSterling_: imagine max does all ubers before quin
[0:43:37] DunzoCD: Madge
[0:43:39] SavageFromSpace: no cheating chat :(
[0:43:39] mk__9: Chatting
[0:43:40] LemmingsOCE: No Spoilers Madge
[0:43:44] mega2g: @squats3 quin barely does normal memory game
[0:43:44] Lara_TV_: oh no, max doesn't like memory games?
[0:43:44] Joneim: RAGEY
[0:43:46] garynrex2: spoilers Sadge
[0:43:48] Lara_TV_: I plan to add that to mine :D
[0:44:02] Squats3: @mega2g he makes a build that can tank it lol
[0:44:12] LionButLeon: ICANT
[0:44:16] Hred5: Sadge
[0:44:17] deakalips: not 3, more
[0:44:27] Joneim: No
[0:44:27] GelatoSquid: those fireballs will instant one shot
[0:44:27] LemmingsOCE: Nah lmao
[0:44:28] SavageFromSpace: nah
[0:44:28] Squats3: newp
[0:44:31] m_dep: no poe doesnt really have fall off stuff
[0:44:40] LucasSterling_: quin the type of guy to make a build so tanky that he doesnt have to do mechanics
[0:45:05] Joneim: :)
[0:45:10] kitty0chi: the brain?
[0:45:23] brosciencegym: It is time to celebrate Chinese New Year's with Max
[0:45:53] leubinator: if u miss it u are dead too
[0:45:59] m_dep: almost all of them
[0:46:00] Hred5: all of them
[0:46:01] LemmingsOCE: The big red fireballs would
[0:46:02] Drukalnn: nearly all of it
[0:46:04] almostdps: memory game you die if you fail
[0:46:05] DunzoCD: almost everything
[0:46:06] GelatoSquid: the fireballs and the brain laser will one shot
[0:46:09] Shastoos: memory game fail would
[0:46:12] turd_master_69: Any normal character would get absolutely smoked by every single hit hes taking
[0:46:14] notcoffee_: did you watch the feared invitation yet? that shit was fucking crazy
[0:46:15] Drukalnn: he builds extremely tanky in the first place
[0:46:21] SavageFromSpace: he is absolutely stacked for this one
[0:46:22] dubbyatt: he has to use a pot for the white balls
[0:46:22] Squats3: memory game fail will 1 shot. the transition will also one shot if he doesnt get on the platform
[0:46:23] Leica_: nah not everything one shots him if he gets one shot by everything tis impossible
[0:46:23] LemmingsOCE: If he got shotgun by most of the projectiles he would die
[0:46:24] Amorags: If he doesnt have molten shell up almost everything
[0:46:25] Seskass: he is insanely tanky, most of the softcore players would get one shot by almost every projectile
[0:46:25] CladeusXE: no big numbers :( only thing makes me sad
[0:46:28] m_dep: most are 1hit if you dont pop a defensive
[0:46:31] Joneim: There are a handful of VERY telegraphed one shots
[0:46:35] LucasSterling_: keep in mind, this is god gamer himself Ben, and it still looks insane
[0:46:37] JakeParkbench: The big fireballs are bad, but with flash tech it needs to one shot or it wont kill him
[0:46:38] deakalips: he cant tank couple cascade, thats all, everything else  = oneshot
[0:46:48] JakeParkbench: Flask*
[0:46:51] leubinator: this is 8 days in instead of 2 days in
[0:46:53] taxiidk: ben said this gauntlet had the scaling that the things he should tank almost kill him and the things that should 1 shot him 1 shot him
[0:46:53] GelatoSquid: his character is so insanely zoote
[0:46:57] Voso505: who is ben in liquid?
[0:46:57] MrAndersen_: i assume hes done this boss a million times
[0:47:02] DunzoCD: GIGACHAD
[0:47:06] mandenmedanden: I need help clearing something up. Does Soul Thorns damage scale with boss stacks on second boss in waycrest?
[0:47:08] LionButLeon: GIGACHAD
[0:47:15] Line_0: For sure
[0:47:19] JakeParkbench: The feared fight it actual ultra instinct levels
[0:47:20] panser_nes: yeah but not with these affixes
[0:47:20] m_dep: yes
[0:47:21] Joneim: The Gauntlet mods make it a VERY different vibe
[0:47:24] thoromyr19: this looks really fun
[0:47:25] LemmingsOCE: Uber Exarch would be a fun one to watch as well
[0:47:30] DunzoCD: its also different everytime since she summons random bosses
[0:47:32] Squats3: @Maximum any mechanic that isnt purple here isnt part of the normal game. its.. all new
[0:47:36] vakaarian: @mandenmedanden Yeah it does
[0:47:39] GelatoSquid: those lasers turn off all regen
[0:47:52] m_dep: @Maximum the beams remove your healing and slow you if you touch them ever, so much precision
[0:47:53] Squats3: yes it is
[0:48:00] Joneim: The spinny beams disable ALL hp recovery, so stepping on one basically kills you
[0:48:01] Squats3: yup
[0:48:01] zysmos: my adhd brain can't to that
[0:48:02] LemmingsOCE: Yep
[0:48:02] GelatoSquid: YEP
[0:48:02] Alpha_Duck: to put it in perspective, imexile is the 2nd best player and gave up this event
[0:48:03] lolwhateverdog: is this lost ark or what
[0:48:03] DunzoCD: YEP
[0:48:03] JakeParkbench: You have to log
[0:48:04] Squats3: just poof
[0:48:11] saladbar19: holy shit
[0:48:12] LionButLeon: LEFT TOP RIGHT WAYTOODANK
[0:48:15] Squats3: yeah you can log out
[0:48:16] Caseman984: six is like maximum short term memory
[0:48:26] ement_: well, the middle beam spread faster if you fail
[0:48:31] mk__9: petri flask
[0:48:31] Alasacy: that expanding circle during the memory game is the timer for it
[0:48:33] LucasSterling_: nah, just make build that can tank it
[0:48:33] Aosin_: gauntlet requires you only use 3 portals though
[0:48:34] Aosin_: not 6
[0:48:39] reign__ttv: petri out
[0:48:40] DunzoCD: YEP logout macros
[0:48:43] LemmingsOCE: Shotgunning that proj is nasty
[0:48:44] Mindthemoons: @vakaarian U sure about Goliath, we're having a discord argument, I don't think thorns/fire scales
[0:48:45] kiblinix: his Feared fight was a clusterfuck
[0:48:52] aralta_: You get used to it. Memory game is simple
[0:48:56] donflamingofps: what game is that chat ?
[0:49:03] LuciFeariUm: @Mindthemoons fire scales, thorns doesnt
[0:49:05] harrybps: Death will not be an escape.
[0:49:09] lakris123: @donflamingofps path of exile
[0:49:14] illicitlol: you should watch quins version of this after LOL
[0:49:16] Themselves: please watch searing exarch after this
[0:49:17] Squats3: im like 99% sure max wouldnt even get to ubers.. he would get annoyed at farming the shards to get there
[0:49:26] Seskass: check Uber uber elder kill, even Ben said it was the hardest boss so he did it last
[0:49:28] Alpha_Duck: for his build to do any damage he needs to stand still near the boss for 1.5seconds so cant just run around constantly
[0:49:31] Mindthemoons: @LuciFeariUm We take that, 51% right then
[0:49:34] JakeParkbench: He would log
[0:49:36] LemmingsOCE: Uber Exarch would be a fun one to watch as well if you want
[0:49:41] DunzoCD: Sadge loot
[0:49:42] Themselves: watch searing exarch please
[0:49:42] GelatoSquid: watch his feared kill it's actually insane @Maximum
[0:49:49] Shastoos: feared one is really good
[0:49:50] Aosin_: feared and uber elder are probably the most nuts
[0:49:58] yuhhhhe: you would love seraing exarch max
[0:49:58] skar4317: feared is really cool
[0:50:00] LemmingsOCE: Yeah uber uber elder is nasty
[0:50:01] m_dep: feared is the hardest fight in the game
[0:50:01] CoffeeASAP: ALOO
[0:50:03] alarkin: I think maven is the most nuts
[0:50:05] m_dep: its all the hard bosses at the same time
[0:50:07] Aosin_: feared
[0:50:07] DunzoCD: feared is multiple bosses
[0:50:07] Themselves: exarch
[0:50:07] almostdps: feared
[0:50:08] Joneim: Searing exarch aka Painsmith
[0:50:08] skar4317: feared

[0:50:10] insa_1111: feared
[0:50:11] panser_nes: exarch
[0:50:12] JakeParkbench: Just watch the feared its impossible to even understand how much shit is going on
[0:50:13] yuhhhhe: exarch is like painsmit
[0:50:13] GelatoSquid: Feared
[0:50:14] m_dep: feared is all the hard ones at the same time
[0:50:14] aralta_: Feared
[0:50:15] Alasacy: feared
[0:50:17] kiblinix: his exarch was fast
[0:50:18] AP_MISXO: tutorial boss
[0:50:19] Seskass: feared
[0:50:19] dubbyatt: he owns exarch fast
[0:50:19] Squats3: yes
[0:50:19] TheGetCracked: Uber Uber Elder
[0:50:20] shook_red: Feared
[0:50:21] healqq: biggest points one
[0:50:21] SuckaFoo: feared
[0:50:28] LemmingsOCE: Yeah feared  is so nasty

[0:51:13] Joneim: No
[0:51:14] Muspel: Not ALL of them, but most of them. And it's not their uber versions
[0:51:17] mega2g: yes
[0:51:19] spiritcheese: wtf
[0:51:19] healqq: they are non-uber versions

[0:51:23] GelatoSquid: and they're giga juiced because gauntlet
[0:51:30] insa_1111: it should be uber versions
[0:51:40] Joneim: That would be psycho
[0:51:41] Nizenw: the normal game uber versions pretty much
[0:51:42] LemmingsOCE: Still has crazy mods from the Gauntlet
[0:51:42] m_dep: @Maximum shaper has a bullet hell phase and you normally get a shield, in this fight there's no shield
[0:51:47] m_dep: more mechanics
[0:51:48] Themselves: new mechanics too
[0:51:49] gama41: all
[0:51:50] Joneim: More mechanics, more hp

[0:51:59] jamyynn: wtf is going on
[0:51:59] its_WiKeD: so like this is tru endgame PoE now? because this is a specific thing with ziz?
[0:52:00] Birraga: Uber is the mythic version of the fight
[0:52:09] LemmingsOCE: Same gear
[0:52:11] UnheardGrace: what two wow raid bosses would be fun to fight simultaneously, assuming they were tuned to be killable?
[0:52:15] lolwhateverdog: no offense but i am not playing any game that calls a difficult 'uber'
[0:52:16] JakeParkbench: He knows what can hit him and what one shots
[0:52:21] bo0oly: this looks like a council boss ICANT
[0:52:23] healqq: it is same gear except some adjustments for the fight
[0:52:24] m_dep: hes not getting hit by any of the scary stuff
[0:52:25] blacklight_____: @UnheardGrace sennarth and razsageth :)
[0:52:28] m_dep: 6 portals
[0:52:30] LemmingsOCE: Yeah

[0:52:37] Leica_: not 6 portals
[0:52:39] GelatoSquid: he has 3 portals
[0:52:39] Alpha_Duck: you normaly get 6 chances, for the event he gets 3
[0:52:40] Joneim: Yes, THIS IS BEING FIXED IN POE 2 WICKED
[0:52:41] Leica_: 3 portals in this event
[0:52:42] Muspel: 3 portals (normally 6, but 3 for the gauntlet)
[0:52:44] JakeParkbench: its only 3 portals for the gauntlet
[0:52:44] Themselves: 3 portals because of the event
[0:52:51] Roelliee: Roelliee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 9 months POG
[0:53:05] LemmingsOCE: Those red circles will chuck him heaps
[0:53:11] Alpha_Duck: there is plenty in there that will 1shot him he just knows what he can tank
[0:53:18] LucasSterling_: theres almost nowhere safe to stand
[0:53:18] m_dep: the shaper bullet hell without the normal RP shield is fucking nuts
[0:53:18] healqq: he has a pretty OP neck that helps with a lot of small hits
[0:53:20] Brohdin: WAYTOODANK eating his bitrate so hard lol
[0:53:21] m_dep: hardest part of the feared imo
[0:53:22] panser_nes: exarch is pretty cool to watch
[0:53:35] Squats3: i feel like exarch would have been a better watch. its like ARPG painsmith so you could relate to the boss more. @Maximum
[0:53:36] DunzoCD: Chayula monkaS
[0:53:48] Xulu_: I've never played PoE, and I have absolutely no idea what's going on....
[0:53:49] LemmingsOCE: Yeah Exarch is more mechanics less shit on the screen
[0:53:53] turd_master_69: ben knows exactly what one shots him and doesnt
[0:53:54] Joneim: I think Uber Exarch is a more interesting fight
[0:53:55] chop_oog: Literally just make an armour stacker and you can facetank the entire game
[0:53:56] healqq: nobody will do it probably on this gauntlet
[0:53:57] troxleer: Kappa
[0:53:58] turd_master_69: bens knowledge is what carries him
[0:54:07] turd_master_69: and giga skill obvs
[0:54:10] chop_oog: @turd_master_69 100%
[0:54:11] ratgefingah: whats the plan 2day chief?
[0:54:16] kiblinix: exarch is watchabl
[0:54:16] GelatoSquid: I think this is the hardest fight in specifically this gauntlet
[0:54:17] Joneim: All of the invitations are Bullet hells, you beat them by having fat defense and dps
[0:54:17] Muspel: The problem with this is that there's a soft enrage
[0:54:18] Alasacy: this was the 2nd hardest part of the gauntlet, only uber uber elder was worse
[0:54:18] m_dep: Without gauntlet, the feared is more difficult than uber maven (I'm a shitter and I've killed both)
[0:54:20] skar4317: he did this 2nd to last because he was sure he was gonna die
[0:54:20] m_dep: usually
[0:54:21] gama41: for gauntlet there was a harder fight yea '
[0:54:22] Muspel: The platform is filling up with puddles
[0:54:24] spiritcheese: Feared with the modds , and attack speed is insanely hard
[0:54:24] Alpha_Duck: in this event some ubers are easier but in normal poe feared is easier
[0:54:25] gama41: per ben said
[0:54:26] illicitlol: you should play it
[0:54:27] Alpha_Duck: with how the mods scale
[0:54:29] healqq: this is harder, a lot of one-shots and you can't really see things
[0:54:29] mytherel: mytherel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[0:54:36] Aosin_: he saved uber elder for last
[0:54:37] LucasSterling_: uber uber elder is crazy
[0:54:39] ham_hands_: this is NOT world of warcraft
[0:54:45] gama41: uber uber elder
[0:54:45] LemmingsOCE: Uber Uber elder
[0:54:46] Leica_: theres a lot of one shots you cant really see (slams mostly)
[0:54:46] Devir0: Uber Uber Elder was harder mathemathicly,he said it after event
[0:54:46] Shastoos: uber uber elder
[0:54:47] almostdps: uber uber elder
[0:54:47] LemmingsOCE: Uber uber
[0:54:49] m_dep: uber uber elder
[0:54:50] Aosin_: uber uber*
[0:54:53] xhriiis: uber uber elder
[0:54:53] LucasSterling_: uber ubder
[0:54:55] JakeParkbench: Yeah he cant clear the adds in Uber Elder so its a pure dps race
[0:54:57] LemmingsOCE: Uber uber Û†ÄÄ
[0:55:00] copterskates: lmao
[0:55:00] Joneim: uber uber
[0:55:01] leubinator: uba uba
[0:55:01] garynrex2: uber uber KEKW
[0:55:01] LionButLeon: UBER UBER xdd
[0:55:01] Themselves: uber uber yea
[0:55:02] skar4317: uber uber elder yes
[0:55:02] Muspel: Uber uber elder, yeah
[0:55:04] DunzoCD: uber uber YEP
[0:55:06] LucasSterling_: ooba ooba xdd
[0:55:07] mega2g: yes
[0:55:08] Tobylicious96: Ooba OOba YEP
[0:55:08] panser_nes: uba uba
[0:55:09] gama41: old naming schemes
[0:55:10] Joneim: Uber elder is a OLD fight
[0:55:11] ement_: uber uber elde when shaper and elder are there
[0:55:12] Alasacy: shaper + elder
[0:55:13] healqq: that's just a historical reason
[0:55:14] Joneim: Uber uber is the modern one
[0:55:15] almostdps: cause uber elder was the first uber and not hard enough
[0:55:15] NotD4k: why not
[0:55:15] Alpha_Duck: he gave himself 10% chance to beat uber uber edler
[0:55:16] Shastoos: 2 uber bosses in one
[0:55:17] surpriseparty20: Ubeareats elder
[0:55:17] m_dep: uber elder is "Elder + Shaper", and is an old school fight. Uber uber is the uber of that fight.,
[0:55:20] Squats3: two story bosses put together
[0:55:20] Pumaska: versions clashing
[0:55:20] ililillllllil: 2 boss
[0:55:22] GelatoSquid: original uber elder is 5 years old, so they gave it another when they added the ubers @Maximum
[0:55:28] Themselves: this one
[0:55:29] Muspel: Originally there was just elder and uber elder. In a later patch they added super versions of each boss, and Elder got one, so that became uber uber elder
[0:55:29] DunzoCD: the elder/shaper joint fight is called uber elder then they added an uber version
[0:55:30] Themselves: is insane
[0:55:30] cinBishop: they found a way to fit more uber in
[0:55:38] spiritcheese: √úberelder ist shaper with elder, and Uber Uber ist Uber version of it
[0:55:39] nitrogsen: nitrogsen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! maximumHelpme
[0:55:39] Leica_: watch his health on this fight
[0:55:43] leubinator: thounsands
[0:55:43] Joneim: 100-200?
[0:55:44] GelatoSquid: 1000+
[0:55:46] almostdps: thousands
[0:55:46] LucasSterling_: 1000+
[0:55:48] Alasacy: thousands
[0:55:49] DunzoCD: alot its been around awhile
[0:55:49] healqq: > 1000
[0:55:49] gama41: 10s of thousands
[0:55:51] atamdev: legit thousands
[0:55:53] dknamey: 3
[0:55:54] Squats3: thousands. this is a old fight
[0:55:56] Teeemosh: atleast 2
[0:55:56] Trizle: around 10 practice runs on standdard today
[0:55:57] LucasSterling_: he can practice in softcore
[0:55:57] iCresp: man I dont even know what the fuck is going on lol
[0:55:58] m_dep: uber elder is like 5 years old +, used to be the main end game boss to grind
[0:56:18] Teeemosh: hp moved monkaS
[0:56:22] Leica_: the fucked part here is adds for him
[0:56:24] Alpha_Duck: ben used to purely boss for profit before these events existed
[0:56:25] LemmingsOCE: I dont think people realize how deliberate his movement is
[0:56:33] Alpha_Duck: was known for hitting 100 doing nothing but farming one of them
[0:56:33] xhriiis: it‚Äôs an add that drops void zones
[0:56:35] spiritcheese: wtf
[0:56:37] GelatoSquid: propogator spits degens on the floor that last forever
[0:56:38] xhriiis: which is the problem
[0:56:41] Joneim: The propigators Drop a permanent Degen zone on a cooldown
[0:56:43] saladbar19: Ben is a monster
[0:56:59] Leica_: the hard part is you run out of room if you play this badly
[0:57:01] lowhealthbg: There might not be another poe player in the world who could kill this
[0:57:02] Aosin_: flask
[0:57:03] m_dep: yeah
[0:57:05] LemmingsOCE: Goat man goat man there he is Bahhh bahhh üêê
[0:57:05] gama41: bunch of dmg reduction yea
[0:57:06] Joneim: Big defensive
[0:57:08] friday_exe: bes has to be the most skillfull not just poe, but gamer in general, man he rocks
[0:57:09] Muspel: The ring doesn't do damage until it expires
[0:57:12] twitchracha: Will he ever get back to rading?
[0:57:14] Pumaska: Ben was the only one to kill these this gauntlet right?
[0:57:20] gama41: all of the ubers yea
[0:57:22] SerasVallo: I understand so little of what I'm seeing lol
[0:57:24] gama41: others may push alter
[0:57:26] gama41: later
[0:58:17] SgtBigCactus: I just tuned in. what game is this? looks cool
[0:58:18] reggiepowa: diablo looks pretty good I'd say
[0:58:27] LemmingsOCE: @SgtBigCactus PoE, watching ben kill bosses
[0:58:38] Joneim: Posting beta Screenshots PepeLaugh
[0:58:45] totemic_: xdding
[0:58:53] spiritcheese: RageyBoom
[0:59:05] Joneim: Jungroan did 1 other uber
[0:59:07] GelatoSquid: nobody's even close to ben right now
[0:59:12] Alpha_Duck: 1 has kileld 2 ubers and a few have killed some normal
[0:59:19] imnevergoodatanything: Normal bosses. only jungroan did ubers and only managed 2
[0:59:20] Archmage_Michael: POE main in Twitter bio probably goes hard
[0:59:25] Joneim: Jung died to Uber maven Sadge
[0:59:27] copterskates: it was basically a gauntlet to see if ben could beat the most ridiculous shit possible
[0:59:33] lowhealthbg: There is only one other player who killed any ubers at all
[0:59:44] LemmingsOCE: Its just insane what hes doing rn
[0:59:47] illicitlol: Did Ben win?
[0:59:47] qt_girl_gamer: just avoid dmg and kill boss doesnt sound too hard
[0:59:49] DunzoCD: this is wild
[0:59:50] Squats3: where are all the stream at
[0:59:51] metel7: what is the gap between every1 else?
[0:59:51] leubinator: the ben retirement fund gauntlet
[0:59:54] theDirtyon3: Built diff
[0:59:55] m_dep: For context, the big circles are safe in the center circle our outside everything. Middle is dangerous.
[1:00:02] BiblibobEUWest: pretty sure I could do that, I beat d4 in hardcore
[1:00:03] healqq: dedication
[1:00:04] PJs_Banana: he doesn't need sleep
[1:00:04] EQR_Aiphaton: as someone who watched Bens "rize" in poe from a few years ago ... its actually insane the way he plays
[1:00:04] almostdps: just built dif
[1:00:05] Alpha_Duck: his approach is much more professional
[1:00:13] Brohdin: game knowledge OP
[1:00:14] Aqinog: imexile was pretty close last gauntlet but he died early this one @Maximum
[1:00:17] SuckaFoo: he know the most efficient ways to farm, craft and overall game knowledge is nuts
[1:00:20] tofusunrise: hes just faker of poe idk
[1:00:24] SerasVallo: some people's brains are just built diffy, they have a natural talent at it plus they practice a ton
[1:00:25] zysmos: he's played the game for ever
[1:00:25] Alpha_Duck: does much more planning and math and nothgin he does is for the sake of it
[1:00:34] misran: most people with Ben‚Äôs skill probably end up in more lucrative games
[1:00:37] Joneim: There are others with comparable mechanical skill, but he is great at EVERYTHING, from crafting to progression to sanctum +++
[1:00:37] bananomon_: he is just cracked on PoE honestly
[1:00:38] Alpha_Duck: won't just map to elvel he'll always be doing something
[1:00:39] LemmingsOCE: He doesnt fuck around, plus it takes all the knowledge plus skill to do what he does
[1:00:40] Seskass: there are close 2nds, but in this gauntlet they died early and gave up
[1:00:45] m_dep: Its too fast / reflexive compared to WoW. Not everyone meets the physical requirements.
[1:00:46] aidan_pryde: Lots of good plaayers left over the years
[1:00:53] Xavoro: Imexile is close and won some aswell
[1:01:07] twitchracha: @Maximum will ben ever get back to raiding?
[1:01:08] fateggnogg: what did ben play in wow?
[1:01:10] LemmingsOCE: Exile is pretty damn close to Ben
[1:01:20] theDirtyon3: @fateggnogg anything he wanted
[1:01:21] mattchewk: @fateggnogg tank warrior anything you ever needed
[1:01:24] pokirane: yea but can he get a nuke in a call of duty lobby
[1:01:28] EQR_Aiphaton: Bens best attribut is understanding and his anticipation i think ... pure mechanicly he is not the best
[1:01:29] Renny_S: difference is in wow individual skill doesnt matter if ur team sucks, whereas poe he can go hard and its likely to be more profitable
[1:01:33] father_tito: well yeah he does that too
[1:01:34] m_dep: i mean he basically does mostly
[1:01:35] shook_red: Exile
[1:01:39] XazzidTV: he does completely windmill dunk everyone
[1:01:42] GelatoSquid: he windmill dunked everyone this time for sure but he's lost gauntelts before
[1:01:43] lowhealthbg: for racing as a singular disciplin there is a player similarly dominant as ben for this stuff
[1:01:44] XazzidTV: imexile is the only person close
[1:01:45] SuckaFoo: he windmill dunks 99.9%
[1:01:47] greatangelsanguinius: why do u think Ben is so much ahead of others?
[1:01:50] Deatheran: @Maximum id say hes the best but there are a few that are up there with him.
[1:01:51] Shastoos: it kinds goes ben..exile.....rest
[1:01:52] healqq: @Renny_S lol
[1:01:59] bergy101: hes cold blooded
[1:02:02] brunaine: his approach from day 1 to day of bossing is really really well planned, he knows what he's gonna be doing in day X before it even started, he doesn't waste time on anything really effective with his time
[1:02:05] kanonkasper: You¬¥re saying that firedup isnt the best wow player on earth?
[1:02:07] Renny_S: @healqq ?
[1:02:08] father_tito: exile i would say is a faster player than ben, but death is the great equalizer
[1:02:09] Mtngs: Is he leaving the zone to avoid something?
[1:02:10] malevolentww: RP
[1:02:11] spiritcheese: YEP he won
[1:02:16] DunzoCD: grace period with immunity
[1:02:20] leubinator: hands of keyboard GIGACHAD
[1:02:32] LemmingsOCE: You can see bounties at the top
[1:02:34] gama41: should be a tab for bounties
[1:02:37] Trizle: at the top
[1:02:38] Alpha_Duck: top right
[1:02:41] Trizle: bounty board
[1:02:43] LemmingsOCE: Full screen it
[1:02:46] Joneim: Full screen it
[1:02:50] mentoku: get out of mobile view
[1:02:52] Joneim: Bad website
[1:02:52] cinBishop: make the window bigger, that site has an aggressive mobile layout
[1:03:02] Renny_S: u had a nav bar on the left
[1:03:09] Alpha_Duck: you can filter unclaimed
[1:03:14] aidan_pryde: @maximum imo lots of good players just rmt without streamer imo.
[1:03:14] pokirane: üíÖ slay
[1:03:20] Hili_chen: "Unclaimed" on the top right
[1:03:26] bananomon_: There is also the argument that he is not afraid of playing meta builds, a lot of good PoE players end up playing their favourite builds (like Alkaizer with melee)
[1:03:29] brunaine: about ben, his approach from day 1 to day of bossing is really really well planned, he knows what he's gonna be doing in day X before it even started, he doesn't waste time on anything really effective with his time
[1:03:30] Aosin_: flame blast is the big red circle that you saw the boss do
[1:03:31] aidan_pryde: Streams*
[1:03:36] Joneim: ??????????
[1:03:36] Teeemosh: xdx
[1:03:38] DunzoCD: HUH

[1:03:46] Line_0: Lol
[1:03:47] ham_hands_: HUH
[1:03:52] LemmingsOCE: Most sane poe chatter
[1:03:53] Joneim: Sure you can fucking RMT in SOLO SELF FOUND
[1:03:57] Joneim: xdd
[1:04:00] notcoffee_: check conditions for the one at the top
[1:04:00] spiritcheese: HUH RMT in SSF?
[1:04:00] theDirtyon3: no shot someone said that
[1:04:01] garynrex2: xdd
[1:04:01] aidan_pryde: Yes in poe
[1:04:01] dubbyatt: Chatting
[1:04:03] Teeemosh: classic ssf rmt
[1:04:04] syku1: absolute 3head
[1:04:06] SuckaFoo: this is SSF were talking about not sc trade
[1:04:06] father_tito: poe ran by the soviet mafia facts
[1:04:06] malevolentww: rmt does not matter in this bracket
[1:04:09] JohntheBarbarian: hes tal;king to the ghosts
[1:04:09] LemmingsOCE: RMT in SSF xdd
[1:04:10] DunzoCD: SSF rmter ICANT
[1:04:10] malevolentww: lol wtf
[1:04:11] Deatheran: @Maximum there was a HUUUGE drama with a discord RMTing tons and tons of money
[1:04:13] J_a_m_e_s_bond: J_a_m_e_s_bond subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:04:14] pokirane: oneguy
[1:04:14] illicitlol: that is just a dumb take
[1:04:18] toique: you cant RMT SSF
[1:04:18] Themselves: anyone who is the best at a game and doesn't stream is just missing out on money. the best will always stream
[1:04:19] pokirane: xdd
[1:04:23] Themselves: xdd
[1:04:24] EQR_Aiphaton: yes .. they RMT sell currency / items.
[1:04:28] turd_master_69: being a top trader does not mean u are good at the game ur just a degenerate
[1:04:32] LemmingsOCE: Yeah in trade league, it was like a gallywix situation
[1:04:33] Barborsa: Mic is all good now ?
[1:04:34] Leica_: the discord rmt is completely unrelated to the gauntlet
[1:04:34] spiritcheese: YEP TfT Drama
[1:04:42] sednajoan: just got here... clueless... what are we up to?
[1:04:42] malevolentww: RMT does not matter in this gauntlet though, it's an entirely different bracket
[1:04:43] imnevergoodatanything: thats just tft they dont really care about that
[1:04:46] LemmingsOCE: It was pretty much a gallywix situation
[1:04:48] father_tito: filter bounties by unclaimed btw, top right
[1:04:48] Joneim: Stay clear of TFT drama, those people are not ok
[1:04:49] IamBadSry: @spiritcheese oh lord it's spreading.
[1:05:06] Hoshma46: the end of WoD they really started cracking down
[1:05:09] Line_0: The rmt wasn't even the focus of that drama
[1:05:09] Themselves: oh ben hasn't done uber cortex yet?
[1:05:11] Themselves: monakS
[1:05:15] toique: I know a turkish guild who makes a living entirely based on RMT
[1:05:38] Squats3: i cannot find where to see the kill vods on this shit website
[1:05:45] aidan_pryde: Im not talking about rmt in this gauntlet, they just dont care about it as they rmt.
[1:05:50] LemmingsOCE: Well thats the nuts thing right? Earning USD in a low value dollar country
[1:05:54] Duranasaur: @Squats3 click on people's points
[1:05:56] Themselves: @Squats3 user error
[1:05:56] zysmos: in eastern europe yeah for sure
[1:05:58] Prezerpro: @Squats3 hover the points and click the icon
[1:05:59] malevolentww: yeah, where rent is like $300usd
[1:05:59] imnevergoodatanything: its like made by one guy i think Sadge
[1:06:01] mega2g: Venezuela runescape gold farm
[1:06:02] turd_master_69: u sell a mirror and thats ur rent in asia
[1:06:06] malevolentww: just farming bags
[1:06:10] pokirane: knew a lotta dudes in eastern eu selling carries and making a more than livable wage
[1:06:10] brunaine: @Maximum about ben, his approach from day 1 to day of bossing is really really well planned, he knows what he's gonna be doing in day X before it even started, he doesn't waste time on anything that shouldn't be done, really effective with his time
[1:06:10] Mtngs: venezuelans earn quite a bit with rmt in runescape iirc
[1:06:12] spiritcheese: @IamBadSry classic can¬¥t more spread asmon made a vid 2 weeks ago
[1:06:16] SerasVallo: any like second world country that has really bad inflation, like Argentina, any job you get that pays in dollars is gold compared to working a job there
[1:06:21] Themselves: yes
[1:06:21] Onyo1337: so many people in EU communties RMT
[1:06:23] Aosin_: tft is a poe discord
[1:06:24] Aosin_: not the game
[1:06:26] Joneim: BEYOND degens
[1:06:26] malevolentww: i belive they mean the TFT trading discord
[1:06:27] malevolentww: for Poe
[1:06:28] LemmingsOCE: TFT is a discord
[1:06:28] syku1: stay clear of the drama he says while mentioning the drama
[1:06:31] daiger5o: 1m gold goes for 15%  of the minimun monthly wage in my country
[1:06:32] imnevergoodatanything: tft as in the forbidden trove poe discord
[1:06:40] LemmingsOCE: TFT drama was pretty much like the Gallywix situation
[1:06:43] m_dep: for all of the reasons
[1:06:45] father_tito: PepeLaugh
[1:06:48] Themselves: PepeLaugh
[1:06:51] Line_0: Just because they banned a ton of people
[1:06:53] Themselves: ü§°
[1:06:53] Joneim: They wanted a full monopoly
[1:06:54] Muspel: Think of TFT as being like the most insane insular class discord, but for PoE trading
[1:06:58] mcfireCH: @Onyo1337 eeeem no, def not
[1:06:58] Prezerpro: @LemmingsOCE tft has way more power in the game than gallywix ever had
[1:06:59] xhriiis: oh lord don‚Äôt ask max it‚Äôs too much
[1:07:10] IamBadSry: PepeLaugh  here we go
[1:07:12] LemmingsOCE: @LemmingsOCE True, but i think its a decent similarity
[1:07:16] imnevergoodatanything: People can sell in trade items in bulk but the leaders there ban people left and right for small reasons and theres rmt aswell
[1:07:17] GelatoSquid: TFT = Gallywix @Maximum
[1:07:21] misran: ‚Äústay clear of this drama you would‚Äôve been completely unaware of til I mentioned it‚Äù
[1:07:21] Alpha_Duck: power tripping neckbeards is the tldr of the drama

[1:07:33] Onyo1337: @Onyo1337 surely not. all the persians just make millions of gold for mounts Kappa
[1:07:37] Aosin_: because the tft owner has power over the entire bulk trading market
[1:07:40] DunzoCD: it was more about them controlling the game market for certain items
[1:07:41] Lam_69: 9 ads LET ME IN ! >:(
[1:07:48] Themselves: @Maximum it's like if gallywix was ran by a self-described antisocial schizo who constantly banned people from the service if they didn't follow his trade etiquette. guy would @everyone to flame streamers if they said something bad about him
[1:07:50] Celynae: This is why Minecraft has such a strict EULA, servers were making more money than Mojang wanted to allow by selling in-game boosts :P
[1:08:01] Joneim: They would doxx and spew garbage at competitors
[1:08:04] Joneim: +++
[1:08:11] spiritcheese: Asmon made a vid over the Trading Drama
[1:08:12] Alpha_Duck: the problem with tft is it is required for some things because the base game doesn't allow for some trade situations

[1:08:21] Themselves: yes
[1:08:27] DunzoCD: very similar
[1:08:27] Joneim: Oh yes
[1:08:28] LemmingsOCE: Thats 100% it
[1:08:41] aidan_pryde: @maximum they try to enforce craft prices, sell prices and monopoly everything
[1:08:47] father_tito: report, harass, black mail, etc
[1:08:47] soapthelord: based
[1:08:48] Deatheran: @Maximum 1000% nailed it
[1:08:49] Themselves: yea exactly. they would have mirror items that people would pay to copy. they would ban people who didnt work with them
[1:08:50] LemmingsOCE: Pretty much man
[1:08:50] JustVoIta: @Celynae and still there are way to many money server
[1:08:50] bananomon_: yes pretty much
[1:08:52] DunzoCD: YEP
[1:09:00] XxZagixX: TFT was the ONLY way to trade in bulk efficiently and they were being cringe lol

[1:09:12] father_tito: but they started to ban streamers who wouldnt work with them and it blew up on reddit
[1:09:15] imnevergoodatanything: theres rmt and they also ban people for small reasons
[1:09:16] xhriiis: kind of but people rely on them for bulk sales so it‚Äôs all messed up
[1:09:21] Themselves: @Maximum owner of the server would call himself antisocial and a schizo to excuse his shitty behavior
[1:09:32] spiritcheese: But as a High LvL player you need to use tft for some Crafts
[1:09:37] LemmingsOCE: They would ban people who called them out
[1:09:38] Teeemosh: velcuzTom
[1:09:40] father_tito: Anyone who spoke negative about them, yes
[1:09:40] Prezerpro: banning anyone who had any critique whatsoever
[1:09:41] DunzoCD: if you said anything against them you got banned
[1:09:43] imnevergoodatanything: on their discord which people trade alot in
[1:09:44] Aosin_: they banned the guy who makes PoB
[1:09:45] Lam_69: TFT would ban you if you interacting with a banned streamers discord lol.
[1:09:47] Alasacy: They also banned the creator of PoB, what everyone uses to make builds
[1:09:48] LemmingsOCE: They would ban ANYONE who called them out
[1:10:08] Joneim: They also kept banning tool devs like the Path of building dev
[1:10:16] soapthelord: wowgrandma banned because of cartel cucks FeelsBadMan
[1:10:16] reggiepowa: redditors hate streamers though
[1:10:19] GelatoSquid: they banned the guy who maintains POB aka one of the biggest GIGACHAD  in the scene
[1:10:22] Alpha_Duck: the ban is from their discord not the game and the discord is needed for a lot of types of trades/services
[1:10:22] payloon: this guys were power triping , they ban the pob guy
[1:10:26] LemmingsOCE: It didnt even start with a streamer, it started with them banning the guy who made Path of Building, a tool used by everyone
[1:10:28] Ionized4: i cared about lariatboi
[1:10:32] spiritcheese: ICANT
[1:10:44] Lam_69: if max was banned, and you were in his discord server, youd be banned from tft as well lol
[1:10:50] Themselves: the guy "stepped down" from the tft community
[1:10:58] DunzoCD: the dude stepped down
[1:11:00] Themselves: the one people were mad at
[1:11:04] kiblinix: dev gonna make changes so ppl need to use it less
[1:11:07] Aqinog: they made a PR post and changed nothing and it cooled down @Maximum
[1:11:08] xhriiis: their leader got stepped down
[1:11:08] Joneim: They actually got called out by GGG indirectly, GGG will be taking steps to make their services less desirable
[1:11:09] Aosin_: TFT owned doesnt care because he makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a league
[1:11:09] Docaan: The people wanted attention on TFT so GGG can take a stance
[1:11:10] leubinator: @Maximum it was peak the season is already going on for 2 months drama
[1:11:18] IzzyNZ: They banned for ü§° emoji reactions
[1:11:18] LemmingsOCE: The devs even acknowledged it
[1:11:25] Joneim: Nah
[1:11:25] Line_0: Oh there was drama
[1:11:26] spiritcheese: YEP
[1:11:27] DunzoCD: YEP
[1:11:28] LionButLeon: Corpa
[1:11:34] GelatoSquid: there's a couple new counter discords that are popping out
[1:11:35] Alpha_Duck: the discord is currently required they can get away with anything
[1:11:38] father_tito: GGG just wont do anything really. it all comes down to the devs
[1:11:38] Lam_69: i got a 2 week ban for reacting to a post with an emoji
[1:11:41] aidan_pryde: @maximum real problem is that ggg ignored auction, so ppl created discord version of it. And there is hope that for poe2 they would finally fix it so that tft would go away.
[1:11:48] GelatoSquid: Ziz is working on a new discord for people to use instead
[1:11:52] Xavoro: They just have too much power to take down
[1:12:04] illicitlol: The zombie apocalypse has started: ***
[1:12:09] Alpha_Duck: it would be more like if in wow you couldn't m+ without a discord in wow
[1:12:12] GelatoSquid: GGG has also said they're adding in game functionality for some of the stuff TFT offered
[1:12:14] LemmingsOCE: the TFT discord kinda acted like an auction house
[1:12:29] Line_0: I mean the devs acknowledged it so
[1:12:33] Prezerpro: the problem was it was run under powertripping people
[1:12:45] Themselves: there are in game services that require you to trust people. the solution was to create a community discord that ran on a reputation system. because there was no in-game solution it gave the people who offered a solution complete control to do whatever they wanted. led to owners of the community thinking they could get away with anything
[1:12:46] Themselves: Chatting
[1:13:01] imnevergoodatanything: They did a announce a auction system for poe2
[1:13:02] payloon: my friends were baned from that discord because they were "new" to the game. they played for 2 leagues and are still banned
[1:13:19] Joneim: GGG is litterarily taking steps to address this for what its worth
[1:13:22] LifeofSlayer77: KEK2
[1:13:22] aidan_pryde: @maximum now imagine, tft discord is 500k players wide.. And power influx it adds
[1:13:24] LifeofSlayer77: KEKW
[1:13:30] father_tito: ***
[1:13:37] father_tito: if youree looking for entertainment from comments
[1:14:12] Themselves: not really. they had reddit mods defending them who used to be apart of the tft mod team
[1:14:13] Prezerpro: issue is theres no other option, so no choice but to bend the knee
[1:14:21] antipheonixna: the smarter thing to ask for is games to prop up those communities that end up adding to their game
[1:14:22] brighadoon: weak auras are bad for the game and I would love to see it banned.
[1:14:29] DunzoCD: its still a necessary evil to use if you want to bulk trade
[1:14:30] Joneim: xdd
[1:14:31] Themselves: it was a couple weeks ago
[1:14:32] UnheardGrace: reddit is such garbage
[1:14:33] spiritcheese: there are good videos about it ;)
[1:14:34] father_tito: its countless stories of people coming out against them testifying their shitty actions
[1:14:36] SpeedyMcD: kinda off topic but what healer do you think is the most fun? wanna try different roles
[1:14:37] copterskates: huge mistake incoming
[1:14:39] xhriiis: @brighadoon L take
[1:14:57] LemmingsOCE: Yeah they had inside people on reddit helping them push adgenda's for them
[1:15:00] father_tito: ***
[1:15:01] Joneim: Nah
[1:15:03] Themselves: not the original one
[1:15:06] Line_0: just random post
[1:15:13] payloon: mafia shit
[1:15:19] father_tito: it is KEKW
[1:15:20] Joneim: yes
[1:15:20] DunzoCD: pretty much
[1:15:21] TheBuzzhunteR: Dont even get involved in this drama, not worth it man LUL
[1:15:22] spiritcheese: YEP
[1:15:28] LemmingsOCE: One of the quotes from the people involved "He RMT
[1:15:32] Alpha_Duck: the guys making money are making six figures doing it
[1:15:34] L8R_Ajay: THE PROPAGANGDAS!?
[1:15:36] imnevergoodatanything: theres a moderator who worked for them in the poe reddit
[1:15:36] Docaan: they got the money
[1:15:38] TsvDorn: i mean money was involved. lots of it- sure it was some mafia shit LuL
[1:15:40] IamBadSry: I mean they are like the poe trade mafia...
[1:15:42] LemmingsOCE: "He RMT'd so much he was able to buy 10 appartments"
[1:15:46] imnevergoodatanything: or helped them or something
[1:15:47] Celynae: @SpeedyMcD As a lifelong healer 1 trick, Mist Monk is definitely the most fun, and easy to pick up to someone new to healing.
[1:15:48] Aosin_: 6 figures a league*
[1:16:03] aidan_pryde: @maximum they earn alot, and by lot its way more than you can rmt in wow right now
[1:16:14] Naemesis: rat azor
[1:16:36] copterskates: lmao i thought you were gonna say billions of dollars
[1:16:44] pokirane: pull up the reckful vid
[1:16:59] Drenwow: thats 15 CE boosts
[1:17:09] Drenwow: nevermind
[1:17:10] castorlyte: The difference between 1 million and 1 billion is insane. 1 million seconds is 11.5 days and 1 billion seconds is 31.5 YEARS
[1:17:12] Drenwow: thats 150 ce boosts
[1:17:15] Drenwow: jesus

[1:17:40] imabirdhaww: 6bil gold, like 500,000 usd
[1:17:46] LemmingsOCE: "He RMT'd so much he was able to buy 10 appartments" Was a quote from one of the guys who exposed them
[1:18:17] theskot: what else you doing with that money lol
[1:18:37] Deatheran: @Maximum i dont want to even look it up, but im SURE POE currency and items have a huuuuuge RMT potential
[1:18:47] xhriiis: boosting communities have gotten so much worse since the gallywix downfall
[1:18:57] Lam_69: i mean thats sick tho no? I dont see that being a bad thing
[1:19:16] Prezerpro: @Deatheran yep
[1:19:18] Themselves: @Lam_69 games aren't meant to be influenced by people's irl "power"
[1:19:27] soapthelord: @Maximum dont forget about blazing boost who sponsored literally half the wow section at the time (atleast for pvp)
[1:20:13] Camelbak21: reckful had that sponsor pretty sure
[1:20:17] Hoaw: ngl buying gold is peak. that shit costs half as much as wow tokens
[1:20:31] LemmingsOCE: Blizzard are actually coming down HARD on RMT in Classic SOD, lots of accounts getting banned
[1:20:32] soapthelord: @Camelbak21 everyone did
[1:20:34] Lam_69: @Lam_69 I mean I can't think of a time where this actually negatively impacted a game I was playing to be honest. It happens regardless.

[1:21:42] SkirsdagTv: The lead they have for SoD is a real gem; dudes very vocal on twitter and has been pushing out of lot of desired changes
[1:21:45] Squats3: @Maximum RMT is phase 1 of sod destroyed the economy worse than ive ever seen in wow.
[1:21:51] Drukalnn: mopre gold sellers makes no difference
[1:21:54] Gamerhcp: bro what an insane game

[1:22:36] TheFamilyHorde: They want Classic Andies $15 per month so they don't go to pservers.
[1:22:38] Hoaw: augment runes cost 1k a pop, each crafted item requires like 70k gold. i was literally forced to RWT if i wanted to mythic raid cause i had 0 gold
[1:22:42] b1azzuris: gdkps were getting out of hand in SoD even at the end of P1
[1:22:48] LemmingsOCE: The iindustrialization of Classic wow is what kills the game
[1:22:51] b1azzuris: i participated and saw pots rise exponentially
[1:22:52] Boreall: They're also going to lose 40% of the playerbase in classic
[1:22:59] zysmos: it makes the game look bad i think that's why they tackle it
[1:23:04] nellfin: @Lam_69 it's bad for the vast amount of the playerbase
[1:23:07] bananomon_: rmt is never good
[1:23:12] alqallafi: the gdkp leaders make tons of money , they 100% resell it with RMT
[1:23:13] ottermatic69: buying gold kinda fucks the game in classic
[1:23:16] aidan_pryde: @maximum you can put it this way, lets use dorki as example, but reverse one. Rmt players in poe dont play gauntlet cause they would lose way too much to earn nothing, like dorki lose money when he is not streaming for mdi. Wich is why poe has more shadowie players working behid the spotlight. Imo
[1:23:28] Boreall: Indonesian and Venezuelan typically
[1:23:29] Lam_69: @Lam_69 whats the reasoning? because I cant think of it if there is one.
[1:23:30] Sohen: its pinoys now LUL
[1:23:37] Brohdin: in theory it's better for blizz to have to money no?
[1:23:47] LemmingsOCE: It Effects the entire market in Classic
[1:23:51] Archmage_Michael: @Maximum This tweet might be worth talking about : ***
[1:23:55] Squats3: @Maximum well seeing as you couldnt get into a group that wasnt a GDKP run... it had an effect on everything
[1:23:57] pokirane: its crazy how much people rmt in lost ark and nothing happens
[1:23:58] nellfin: @Lam_69 economy inflation for one
[1:23:59] LionButLeon: @Archmage_Michael cant link
[1:24:01] Joneim: xdd
[1:24:06] LifeofSlayer77: xdd
[1:24:08] Hoaw: it doesnt matter though, if that rich guy didnt RMT, he would just get the gold through tokens @Maximum
[1:24:18] Lam_69: wow tokens are capped
[1:24:19] LemmingsOCE: RMT Effects the entire market in Classic, everything costs a shit ton because gold is worthless
[1:24:22] TirrinWoW: thats wrath rn
[1:24:26] Pallyex53: classic wrath was like that
[1:24:38] theskot: id say 80% of ICC runs were GDKPs, and 98% of the runs clearing heroic
[1:24:38] zF_Killswitch: thats what killed Classic for me
[1:24:41] reymargera: BBoomer

[1:25:05] soapthelord: @Maximum more splits maybe?
[1:25:05] Squats3: @Pallyex53 i didnt know gdkp was a thing in wrath till the very end
[1:25:07] BlazinHurricane: Game harder

[1:25:43] ottermatic69: probably because the best gdkps in retail couldnt compete with guilds
[1:25:50] alqallafi: @Squats3 it is insane on wrath , really insane , so much gdkp and gold selling
[1:26:08] Icydeadppl23: was that the Pirate Software guy?
[1:26:10] garynrex2: Aware
[1:26:12] greatangelsanguinius: This leaving blizz is fake
[1:26:12] LemmingsOCE: GDKP's in retail are just buying mythic bosses right?
[1:26:14] LionButLeon: holy Aware
[1:26:19] Squats3: @Squats3 oh wrath as in wrath classic. yeah. back in og wrath, it was a thing but.. not huge
[1:26:20] greatangelsanguinius: it has no proof dont waste ur time

[1:27:37] TheEyeVII: alot of tech companies are laying people off rn in NA it's 5-10% of the work-force, they always over hire
[1:27:37] Lam_69: the west loves to overhire
[1:27:37] Squats3: because stock number must go up

[1:28:15] TheEyeVII: imagine when Ai is gonna come in bud, the laying off now is nothing
[1:28:18] greatangelsanguinius: WOAHHHH NOOOO cant diss riot they have the future wow killer they OWNNN
[1:28:20] antipheonixna: werent the riot layoffs with good severence too at least?
[1:28:20] SigmaIsGreater: PREACH COMRADE MAX
[1:28:22] kelly_mac06: Workers of the world UNITE
[1:28:26] spookylock: You use the word pathetic pretty liberally but you're on point with this one
[1:28:27] Beach2k18: What hapend to Riot MMORPG? it was hyped and now we havent heard a shit
[1:28:28] ctg_dreamz: both riot and blizz will go on a hiring spree again in a few months. Its the cycle of things
[1:28:32] Squats3: our boy qwik left blizzard saying "yeah ima go travel the fucking world and then come back and do this again"
[1:28:33] KaptinKazual: The craziest part is how these people are being fired in some of the most profitable years for these companies.  So it isn't even like they are minimizing loss, they just maximizing gains.  Kind of sickening.
[1:28:41] Stoopedfays: Also in other countries if you are laid off and the company gets back into a position to hire again, they have to offer the people laid off first opportunities
[1:28:47] Holyryze: was trash canned i heard
[1:28:49] Themselves: who in the gaming community is going to lose jobs to ai? Artists? lol
[1:28:50] nellfin: damn near impossible to get fired in most of scandinavia, worst you can get is basicly not getting your contract renewed
[1:28:54] garynrex2: riot had a pretty good severance package tbf
[1:28:56] TheEyeVII: in 2050 I believe
[1:29:01] mantooth11: Isn't Ghostcrawler working on the riot mmo?
[1:29:08] kelly_mac06: @mantooth11 nope
[1:29:08] LionButLeon: @mantooth11 he left long ago lol
[1:29:11] DunzoCD: @mantooth11 he left and is working on his own
[1:29:19] antipheonixna: ghostcrawler was vocal while he was on it, he left so its less vocal, all there is too it
[1:29:20] dansthehunter: @mantooth11 he left riot
[1:29:33] MedicineMan: Layoffs suck even more, when the people that care about the product/platform get hit.
[1:29:37] mfalc: yea ashes of creation has been coming out for 17 yearts
[1:29:42] Holyryze: i thought the MMO got trashed when GC left riot....
[1:29:59] TheEyeVII: riot's been good at "kid friendlying" an IP after they steal it like wc3>dota>league or cs:go>valorant, but mmo wise, idk dude LUL  see ya in 2040
[1:30:06] Veniman: max did u play ffxiv?
[1:30:11] Lam_69: can I make my character look like ahri
[1:30:12] SigmaIsGreater: Man, Ghostcrawler...THAT is a Blizzard throwback
[1:30:14] Joneim: xdd Û†ÄÄ
[1:30:17] LionButLeon: xdd
[1:30:20] Joneim: Any day now guys COPIUM
[1:30:20] ManoahMM: PepeLaugh
[1:30:21] greatangelsanguinius: riot MMO wont drop
[1:30:21] Arisolo: @Maximum the GC stuff was very very weird. He asked for full autonomy on the project and then left
[1:30:23] ottermatic69: surely
[1:30:23] Lara_TV_: Woah why the ashes hate
[1:30:28] Gamerhcp: barring any surprise, Liquid has a free grand final win tomorrow with The Move eliminated
[1:30:28] LionButLeon: ashes of 30 FPS previews
[1:30:31] LionButLeon: xdd
[1:30:32] antipheonixna: ghostcrawler is already spam talking about his new mmo, to show what kinda guy he is LOL
[1:30:36] Themselves: how is league kid friendly
[1:30:38] Themselves: HUH
[1:30:38] garynrex2: xdd "stealing"
[1:30:39] DunzoCD: riot mmo is coming out the year after Star Citizen i heard
[1:30:54] Icydeadppl23: "the ol yoink and twist" love it
[1:30:56] bigmeanbeefy: Palworld towards pokemon
[1:30:58] mfalc: palworld is a banger tho
[1:30:59] pseudo75: HUH pinch n twist
[1:30:59] Lam_69: league isnt kid friendly at all
[1:31:00] greatangelsanguinius: WOW just did the other mmos better
[1:31:03] TheEyeVII: @DunzoCD true
[1:31:04] Avekard: greeting from Poland ;)
[1:31:12] peanutbutterandpancakes: Easier to make super small iterative improvements than be completely new
[1:31:24] dansthehunter: Warcraft steals everything but they do it well so it's completely fine
[1:31:24] Nox1o: id be suprised if riot mmo is a banger right away. Large game companies just dont realese good games recently KEKW
[1:31:25] xpak___: just like the Palworld
[1:31:32] tofusunrise: give me better product thanks
[1:31:33] SigmaIsGreater: "nothing is new under the sun"
[1:31:33] LionButLeon: YEP
[1:31:40] NotDage: yea same as csgo players or vice versa hating on valorant
[1:31:42] arealcuteboy: competition is good
[1:31:43] Themselves: the idea that riot "stole" league after blizzard wasn't interested in making dota into a game is wild
[1:31:45] pokirane: baseg
[1:31:50] TheEyeVII: it's nice to understand the market regardless
[1:31:52] ShaggySummers: sunk cost
[1:32:11] TheEyeVII: @Themselves everyone "steals" to be fair
[1:32:15] dansthehunter: Warcraft stealing ideas got us Dragonriding from GW2 and Dragonriding is great so it's fine
[1:32:16] dorki: its for validation
[1:32:17] antipheonixna: @Nox1o i mean we already seen riot with val, drops+advertising and a decent game
[1:32:23] Icydeadppl23: damn thats deep
[1:32:24] unkkel3383: @dansthehunter I wouldn‚Äôt say well
[1:32:24] dorki: you wanna be playin the right game
[1:32:29] Aqinog: Aware
[1:32:30] thoromyr19: I feel that for sure
[1:32:33] Lam_69: riot absolutely yoinked tft from dota minigame but tft is better
[1:32:38] greatangelsanguinius: Nah i just hate ff online art style
[1:32:41] CoffeeASAP: I only hate the game I'm currently playing
[1:32:47] Rilix: thats what wow did to so many people that played other MMO's when it came out
[1:32:50] Goats48: !SPAM CHAT! Joel Small Indie Company can't inflate mmr. I am Hardstuck 1800 but I know I can be a Gladiator if @Blizzard Would just fix the mmr Joel !SPAM CHAT!
[1:32:56] Swindleditz: its also gameplay vs aesthetic. like wow gameplay vs fF14
[1:32:58] Goats48: sry that was warcraft chat
[1:32:58] LimeSLimeS: stealing ideas and doing them better in general got us warcraft and starcraft, it's just warhammer fantasy/40k done differently
[1:33:00] Goats48: shit
[1:33:00] Clush___: @Maximum yea but d4 bad poe good
[1:33:06] berchberkins: I'm the opposite, I'll go play a game to prove to myself it's ass once a year (league)
[1:33:15] TheEyeVII: @LimeSLimeS exactly
[1:33:17] Joneim: xdd
[1:33:18] Themselves: @berchberkins baseg
[1:33:19] greatangelsanguinius: Yeah thats weird
[1:33:20] garynrex2: d4 bad
[1:33:27] Themselves: d4 bad BASED
[1:33:30] Joneim: Tribalist andies need god
[1:33:36] LionButLeon: d4 bad baseg
[1:33:38] Clush___: d4 bad
[1:33:40] Lam_69: its like shitting on a food that someone said they like. its just weird
[1:33:47] Joneim: D4
[1:33:50] skar4317: d4 bad
[1:33:51] Boreall: Making disliking a game a personality trait
[1:33:52] Aqinog: Hot take it's the same tribalism with vegans vs meat-eaters
[1:33:53] thoromyr19: Have a friend who hated the art style of FFXIV but now logs in once a month to keep his house in game
[1:33:53] alarkin: that twitter thread is absolutely wild - it is some scum of the earth behaviour from blizzard holy shit
[1:33:57] Jarlan23: my friend does that. he knows i loved bg3 and he hated it so he brings up it like every other conversation
[1:34:01] pokirane: lost ark good baseg
[1:34:05] reggiepowa: you described asmons community, they live for wow's downfall
[1:34:09] rukt: being on twitter just melts peoples brains
[1:34:11] SigmaIsGreater: GETCHA FREAK ON
[1:34:11] downdard: why is max always calling out psychos its like he is obsessed
[1:34:11] bayazijr: Max the Riot MMO is gonna make you one of the biggest streamers at least for a little bit
[1:34:24] Joneim: @downdard xdd
[1:34:26] nellfin: i've tried every mmo (almost) to find a better one than wow, but none have succeeded x.x
[1:34:27] alarkin: the riot mmo isn't coming come on be real
[1:34:29] turd_master_69: real friends say have fun bud ok
[1:34:36] olympen: xdd
[1:34:37] Joneim: Its your year buddy
[1:34:37] Datguyjay: real
[1:34:39] pokirane: xdd
[1:34:40] Faraday5001: riot mmo aint never comin out
[1:34:42] TheEyeVII: will any of us be? hard to say
[1:34:43] TCGRebel: riot mmo KEKW
[1:34:43] greatangelsanguinius: ok Max but what about when dudes white knight a game. Example Bellular was an FF simp pretending ff had some fake non toxic community and this would be mentioned in WOW related vids no game has no toxic players
[1:34:43] Docaan: monkaS
[1:34:44] lucashowmuchpain: Aware i wont be
[1:34:45] Pooglemcbots: your grandkids will love it
[1:34:45] Lam_69: pushin 40
[1:34:45] Icydeadppl23: why's it hard to be excited for other games/companies success?
[1:34:47] theskot: do you really
[1:34:47] Arisolo: did sookie land on her feet post layoffS?
[1:34:49] Squats3: he plays hockey again. hes going hard
[1:34:51] zeitgeiz: man I‚Äôll be 41 if it comes out in 2029
[1:34:52] Solitairy_LLG: Week 12, still no lego :(
[1:34:53] cyberklinos: üòÇ
[1:34:54] Jarlan23: LA could fall into the ocean at any second
[1:34:55] ctg_dreamz: Max might not survive filming Goon 3
[1:34:58] WrathofBambi: THe ghost of asmongold will always reign supreme over the mmo genre
[1:34:58] streatmagic_gaming: @Maximum Are you on board with a DK rework in War Within?
[1:35:01] prowl_shady_fox: @Maximum do you think the riot mmo will kill wow, ion, mike, bobby and all their families?
[1:35:05] harrybps: @Faraday5001 aint never? so it's definitely coming out you mean
[1:35:11] Joneim: Chatting
[1:35:12] Rilix: what are the award show requirements for a mmo streamer category
[1:35:15] olympen: ?? KEKL
[1:35:18] PJs_Banana: What are the chances @Maximum losing a front tooth in hockey before Riot MMO comes out?
[1:35:19] Faraday5001: @Faraday5001 firstGarf
[1:35:20] LionButLeon: Chatting
[1:35:23] Mrpumpernickle: Chatting
[1:35:24] IamBadSry: Chatting
[1:35:28] LifeofSlayer77: Chatting
[1:35:32] nairb1: Chatting
[1:35:37] Squats3: FF has a very non toxic community. as long as you love that game and dont point out any of its flaws
[1:35:40] olympen: Chatting
[1:35:41] JohntheBarbarian: zero comprehension KEKW
[1:35:53] EnrikoSuave: Chatting
[1:35:59] madoxstudios: Certain games have more or less toxic players. WoW has gotten to a really bad level of toxicity over the past few years more than any other MMO
[1:36:07] KaptinKazual: FFXIV, overall, has been generally not that toxic though?  The toxicity has increased SOME (and I would partially blame the wow migration to it.) but overall the community is still better by and far imo,
[1:36:13] GnarstyTV: delete ff delete moonguard, all is solved
[1:36:15] Ruinx81: Do you still play FF?
[1:36:22] eaSyRoca: would you ever play ffxiv again?
[1:36:22] olympen: just like real life TrollDespair
[1:36:35] arcimone: posivibes :)
[1:36:38] superpudd: I have a rule, whatever someone says behind my back in none of my business
[1:36:39] antipheonixna: i mean bell didnt play ffxiv prior so he was just riding the wave of positivity, turns out all mmo playerbases are toxic c:
[1:36:39] tman7493: tman7493 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:36:42] Joneim: @KaptinKazual The toxic positivity has been there since SB, its unbearable
[1:36:43] madoxstudios: FF though is "public facing" far less toxic than wow
[1:36:50] jordaiin: jordaiin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:36:51] TheEyeVII: game tribalism is just human nature, "red vs blue" etc very hot human thing TwitchConHYPE
[1:36:54] darksoldier2245: Larger player bases will have more perceived toxic players, because there just are
[1:36:56] Xemus80: Toxic positivity.
[1:36:58] McFarad: i got banned from the novice network for stating i didn't like a certain new FF14 streamer back a couple years ago
[1:36:58] Swindleditz: ff14 toxicity feels more sarcastic than anything
[1:37:03] LifeofSlayer77: "we're a family here" xdd
[1:37:04] unkkel3383: I‚Äôm
[1:37:05] Boreall: That's Toxic max
[1:37:09] rukt: any job you work for that calls everyone "family" AINTNOWAY
[1:37:12] Turtok_Sayf: ChineseJoel
[1:37:16] Squats3: @madoxstudios because the entire retail community loves to hate the game
[1:37:16] arealcuteboy: real
[1:37:27] madoxstudios: @Maximum That's a wow mentality. in most other MMO's that's not the case
[1:37:29] Goats48: Max I am sorry
[1:37:30] Drizoon: ff14 is the live laugh love of mmos

[1:37:32] NC_Jake: Can you repeat the last 90 seconds I got a commercial?
[1:37:32] TheFamilyHorde: @madoxstudios I tried it out...my sense is it only seemed less toxic because it was way more a single player MMO.
[1:37:40] TheEyeVII: @Squats3 idk about that
[1:37:41] ciphkin_tv: lots of normal/ heroic guilds are like this
[1:37:48] Gorthol217: i mean u cant harrass people ingame in final fantasy, no wonder most people feel like its not toxix
[1:37:49] Madgeneto: i was in a guild called "safe space". disbanded for drama xdd
[1:37:52] iamthegodcomplex: You might be able to do that, I cannot
[1:37:54] olympen: be constructive BASED
[1:37:55] darksoldier2245: Agree
[1:38:06] BIuffwatcher: in England/UK we'll just go "OY TWAT dont stand in the fire!!"
[1:38:19] dr__mantis_toboggan_md: certainly not british, but continental eu yes
[1:38:21] weezull: it's harder to avoid being direct in your second language
[1:38:23] TrenerTrener: 100%
[1:38:28] turd_master_69: 100% i cant stand britts
[1:38:28] Madgeneto: @BIuffwatcher baseg
[1:38:28] leubinator: its hard to not be direct in your second language
[1:38:29] jitsuttv: There's a difference between being direct and being an asshole though
[1:38:29] ShaggySummers: A lot of people here feel dishonest when sugarcoating stuff @Maximum
[1:38:34] olympen: "u noob" baseg
[1:38:38] Nox1o: I think its also related to americans just being fake "nice". Like greeting on the street or in cafes. In EU we dont say anything because we know we dont care about each other
[1:38:48] madoxstudios: @TheFamilyHorde It can feel more solo in that sense, yet from a social perspective it's always safer than letting everyone speak their ignorant minds.
[1:38:58] TheFamilyHorde: To maximize toxicity in wow we need more Solo Queue. Solo RBG's will help. Solo M+ queue would maximize toxicity.
[1:39:08] potetlotto: I thought the us was more direct in general
[1:39:14] raxxom: raxxom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:39:15] Goats48: @TheFamilyHorde so true
[1:39:19] olympen: corporate NA guilds monkaW
[1:39:22] BIuffwatcher: You can be blunt and funny
[1:39:23] Joneim: The EU guilds i've been in have put a heavy emphasis on owning up to your mistakes, not speaking up gets frowned on bad
[1:39:25] darksoldier2245: Such a knightmare
[1:39:29] RaD_762: this exact thing happens in my guild
[1:39:37] ahnn112: when do you do the secret raid leading?
[1:39:40] RaD_762: its super toxic being fake nice
[1:39:42] Caseman984: the american way is to be passive agressive about it in comms
[1:39:44] jaynkumz: in NA stuff I feel best when its roasting type of criticism. It touches on the toxic so you dont do it again but is lively enough to not get mad
[1:39:54] SpeedyMcD: @maximum kinda off topic but did you hear they got rid of wow‚Äôs lead writer back in november. or he left. no one knows
[1:39:58] Swindleditz: its like a  job, if you need something to change or improve your going to talk to them. but if your professional than you arent being a dick
[1:39:59] tavvvv: you gotta tell the person sucking, they are sucking
[1:40:00] tolarianweave: Max how do you deal with people getting mad at you, for harsh leadership decisions you've made in WoW over the years?
[1:40:06] Aakku: My favorite is when folks ask for more accountability, right until they get called out lol
[1:40:06] madoxstudios: So yeah, being direct is good for raids to assist w/ constructive criticism, yet other aspects such as Solo Shuffle there should be a zero tolerance for shit talk.
[1:40:08] Humongouspal: Beautiful wallpaper, is it some WoW's art?
[1:40:11] lskyyyy: thats why you should own the fucking up... its best for everyone, including you..
[1:40:18] antipheonixna: so max is not pro the secret slack groups haha
[1:40:19] TheFamilyHorde: @Caseman984 Depends on the demographics. Millienials are peak passive aggressive. Xers and Zoomers not so much.
[1:40:32] Fevion24: Tuned in during a banger, guess I'm re-watching the VOD on this convo.
[1:40:36] Joneim: xdd
[1:40:41] olympen: TrollDespair
[1:40:42] weezull: you're playing with those people again 100% at higher level lol
[1:40:46] TheFamilyHorde: @madoxstudios Solo Shuffle should have a Prio vote, and all chat turned off.
[1:40:49] Madgeneto: only at high rating
[1:40:56] Solitairy_LLG: My guild just got 6/9 mythic, raid leader posted about increasing performance for smolderon, and we lost like 8 people in a few days. rest of the team is willing to listen and learn. onward and upward.
[1:40:58] TheEyeVII: @Maximum what do you think the pvp community is btw % wise 10%? 30%? 50%?
[1:41:06] darksoldier2245: Clicks thing is such a problem in my guild
[1:41:10] ndras: hide names in soloq and let ppl shit talk each other
[1:41:13] madoxstudios: Yeah, I honestly hope solo shuf mode would prevent whispers, instance chat, etc. Would feel truly "solo"
[1:41:15] tavvvv: I think shit talking should be encouraged, being nice is boring and leads to people quitting the game from boredom
[1:41:19] custom025: 3%
[1:41:19] Goats48: 10%
[1:41:23] Rampo123: 1%
[1:41:24] Joneim: 2-5%?
[1:41:24] Camelbak21: like 2%
[1:41:30] Madgeneto: @madoxstudios what's a prio vote?
[1:41:30] Rampo123: i play wow to collect pets :3
[1:41:32] pergynter: less than 1Q%
[1:41:32] Rampo123: KEKW
[1:41:33] Faraday5001: 6.9%
[1:41:34] soviet_kapitalist: wow would be infinitely better if they straight up deleted PVP. change my mind
[1:41:34] jaynkumz: 10%
[1:41:42] rukt: open world enjoyers GIGACHAD
[1:41:42] highcard2: pvp is small relative to the pve playerbase but theres still quite a lot of pvp players in this game
[1:41:43] TheFamilyHorde: Solo shuffle has bigger problems than toxic chat tho, the small player base just makes everything SO sweaty and a pain for new players to get into.
[1:41:44] TsvDorn: there are mor petbattlers than people who do pvp
[1:41:50] yama_class: 5
[1:41:56] itsXekko: @TheEyeVII 5 or 10% pvp probably
[1:41:57] TheEyeVII: true they punish it
[1:41:59] turd_master_69: there are alot of casual BG players, but RATED pvp it goes down bigtime
[1:42:00] TheFamilyHorde: @Madgeneto Priority Damage target.
[1:42:10] Aakku: the vault makes it worse to both on the same toon now too
[1:42:11] Madgeneto: @Madgeneto you just say that in chat
[1:42:31] Akela_lol: !background
[1:42:32] Squats3: @Maximum this season i felt like i had to get to at least 1600 on every character i played so i could get a free token before getting AOTC.
[1:42:34] Madgeneto: @madoxstudios you can disable that on your own already
[1:42:39] TheFamilyHorde: @Madgeneto Yeah, but it would be ideal if SS had no chat at all imo.
[1:42:40] infosec_lover: @Maximum when undercover raid?
[1:42:46] M__Wolfe: If a game forces pvp I dont play the game, full stop. I just dont enjoy it, and i play the game to have fun
[1:42:46] miceinmyveins: I saw a guy in discord with a furry icon say he only plays worgens
[1:42:56] SpeedyMcD: you guys are tripping if you think the playerbase is that small. theres tons of casual people that pvp. high rated is a different story
[1:42:57] TheFamilyHorde: @Madgeneto Then you don't communicate targets tho.
[1:43:01] Braumance: I feel like top gear should be attained only through top tier content, whether pvp or pve
[1:43:04] dulgr_1: Wow pvp is the best pvp in any game imo.  Sad its so small
[1:43:08] Akela_lol: damn this background is nice, is it available somehwere?
[1:43:09] berchberkins: Why do people want their gamemode/activity to be perceived as dead? Such a weird thing to me
[1:43:11] nightst314: most oeople see PvP as chasing each other around a Pillar. PvP needs some real innovation after 15 years.
[1:43:16] noldan216: People would do any in-game activity that earned player power. Where would people draw the line?
[1:43:25] tavvvv: I dont do either, pvp and pve right now isnt worth it
[1:43:26] iShadowFox: @Akela_lol Dragonflight concept art in wallpaper engine
[1:43:26] TheFamilyHorde: @SpeedyMcD pvp playerbase is probably 15% of PVE.
[1:43:35] Theldro: @dulgr_1 how? you tune in to pvp and it's just running in a circle around a pillar
[1:43:39] Jarlan23: swtor did it really well back in the day
[1:43:42] sniessni: how many dual wield both?
[1:43:47] Akela_lol: @Akela_lol thanks ill look for it
[1:43:47] Jarlan23: wasnt competitive but it was way more fun
[1:43:50] madoxstudios: So in general it feels reporting players for text-chat "elitist, douchebag" chat has no effect. We always get statistics for cheaters/exploiters, but never how reporting players (repeat offenders) are actioned on.
[1:43:55] Squats3: wow pvp is so good. it sucks that the devs stopped giving us meaningful pvp content in expansions.
[1:43:56] Ok_Kingston: LoL and TFT scratch my pvp itch
[1:43:59] TheFamilyHorde: The skill floor on PVP is so high.
[1:44:04] punkekw: so daunting
[1:44:05] Goats48: They need to fix how the rating system work in pvp @Maximum
[1:44:08] rukt: i feel like you have to learn what every class and spec does to do well in pvp
[1:44:12] Jazzarus_: Solo shuffle is really good, they just need to solve rating and matchmaking
[1:44:14] furesway: Wow pvp is what keeps bringing me back for 20 years even though i tend to spend most my time pveing.
[1:44:16] hammanu33: Define new player, Less than 6 months? 12? 24?
[1:44:19] madoxstudios: Everyone has a unique skill level, and having folks (mostly on Tichondrius) talk shit but never getting punished is really toxic
[1:44:20] Theldro: pillar gameplay and getting CC locked for years is not fun.
[1:44:20] Jazzarus_: And the new battleground blitz is awesome too
[1:44:22] TheUhhh_: WoW PVP has the highest barrier to entry out of any MMO I've played
[1:44:22] TheEyeVII: @Squats3 idk what that means, what's meaningful
[1:44:42] nellfin: i wish they made a seperate pvp and pve talent tree... would add so much to both sides
[1:44:43] Joneim: The UI / addon issues are randomly way worse in pvp than pve as well, which makes getting into it a nightmare
[1:44:43] infosec_lover: wow career KEKG
[1:44:46] rukt: career HAH
[1:44:46] Braumance: PVP feels very horrible when you lose, at least with PVE you can eventually brute force content :v
[1:44:46] TheFamilyHorde: They need to introduce a level 20 battle royale mode so my friends will actually get into wow.
[1:44:53] SpeedyMcD: @maximum you should try out next xpac when they do solo que rated rbg‚Äôs. gonna be more popular than solo shuffle lol
[1:44:57] khebul: Isn't depleting keys also not very fun?
[1:44:59] dulgr_1: its bc at 1800 u run into the russian carries
[1:45:00] Squats3: @TheEyeVII anything you can do casually. the high end pvp is there. low end has been stagnant for a very long time. next expansion is finally getting a new BG map.. thats a start. we need..more
[1:45:05] Turtok_Sayf: yo @Maximum why is your room so messed up?
[1:45:10] R0NGG: ya thats all pvp LUL
[1:45:11] WrathofBambi: RBGers monkaW
[1:45:12] shizuma_lol: so do you even like pvp or do you like winning
[1:45:16] miceinmyveins: @madoxstudios I have a guildie who got banned for talking shit to players in chat nothing overly tos just toxic and rude
[1:45:22] Joneim: @turtok_sayf dogs
[1:45:22] madoxstudios: That bracket used to be 1800, but now it's any rating because 0 rated players get paired w/ 1600 in DF solo shuf
[1:45:31] the_great_simonator: I feel like that's pvp as a whole until you have the experience to do it seriously
[1:45:46] DunzoCD: i could see people being annoyed with all the stuns/fears in arena
[1:45:55] TheEyeVII: @Squats3 solo shuf is new to DF also solo shuf rbgs coming in war within, what's missing imo is pvp events like they have in SoD
[1:45:56] ZACKandATTACK: My friends tried to have me PvP with them in Shadowlands when I started and I hated it. The knowledge necessary to not be CC'd for the entire game until you die is cringe.
[1:45:58] MorpheenBE: 10sec unbreakable CC TrollDespair
[1:46:03] madoxstudios: @miceinmyveins I just wish bliz would be more transparent on actions taken for reporting that behavior. The fact they don't report on it just tells me they don't give AF
[1:46:09] the_great_simonator: tried to do some 2v2s with a buddy and it was super fun untill we hit the 1500-1800 io range and we got stomped into the ground
[1:46:10] 1111111111112233: thats like geting hit by a  nasty combo in a  fighting game
[1:46:16] Jarlan23: pvp in WoW tilts me almost instantly but when i do PVE i can wipe 300 times and be just fine
[1:46:27] Madgeneto: you cant be in cc for 30s without one of those being dispellable, aka just blame healer xdd
[1:46:38] TheEyeVII: anyone else hearing some static going on when he talks or just me
[1:46:45] itsXekko: players just want to blast
[1:46:58] Fizzbot125: Stopping damage in raid for phase boundaries
[1:46:58] thoromyr19: Agree with the not being able to play your toon but there are things you can do like spotting enemy casts and calling them out or calling out enemy positions
[1:46:59] nellfin: when is the new sound equipment arriving? xD
[1:47:00] Squats3: @TheEyeVII anything ranked is not casual though. youre not just in there to game. youre there to get rating.
[1:47:03] Goats48: two different games
[1:47:05] Docaan: like pika being forced to play outlaw and he doesn't like it
[1:47:09] matchdo: volcanic is just as bad as quaking for certain casters
[1:47:11] Boreall: Max I hate too much Taco Bell and now my head hurts, will you sing me a lullaby?
[1:47:11] furesway: Pvp allows you to use your entire character's toolbox too.
[1:47:12] punkekw: Ever talk to Chuck on stream?
[1:47:18] JaxingtonMMO: I think pvp would be more interesting without things like blind or poly, just nothing but stuns and roots
[1:47:19] Baskkov: when do you think season 4 will be?
[1:47:20] caveman2x: thats my problem with affixes they are just nuisance most o the time not adding anything ... what doe storming add to a dungeon ?
[1:47:21] eth79: @TheEyeVII sounds like hoovering
[1:47:22] Akela_lol: !schedule
[1:47:28] PJs_Banana: dot dot fear as a warlock in vanilla was the last time i enjoyed pvp lol
[1:47:29] TheFamilyHorde: Battle Royale mode with everybody scaled to level 20 same ilvl. Get rid of the button bloat and allow new people to start learning. Introduce a battle pass to monetize them and incentivize play.
[1:47:32] Zephn: Max is an AI confirmed, voice glitch
[1:47:36] rustandsawdust: March 1st
[1:47:55] limeoflight: @TheEyeVII Why cant that be casual though? You can still play casually for a couple hours a day, I've been playing league ranked casually for like a decade KEKHeim
[1:47:56] Madgeneto: what's the background noise?
[1:47:59] Birraga: what is 10.2.6 do we know
[1:48:01] KaptinKazual: 10.2.6 is confirmed for March and Season 4 a few weeks later.. so probably April
[1:48:09] rustandsawdust: Feb 20th
[1:48:27] theDirtyon3: YEP
[1:48:31] DunzoCD: end of march for alpha?
[1:48:37] antipheonixna: are we having a sub 6 month alpha beta cycle?
[1:48:39] GamerzGamingGames: it's obviously piriates
[1:48:42] Mtngs: Warbands FeelsGoodMan
[1:48:43] PJs_Banana: 10.2.6 is obviously a skull and bones event
[1:48:43] tydrera: what key level is MDI gonna be on?
[1:48:46] thenateo2: 10.2.6 is a secret raid trust me my grandad works at blizzard
[1:48:50] leubinator: lets hope its content
[1:48:54] friday_exe: SoD > all of that shiet
[1:48:54] Shirey12: Warbands has me the most bricked up
[1:48:57] skar4317: What do you think the chances are of 10.2.6 giving us like a 1-2 boss raid
[1:48:57] PJs_Banana: @tydrera 22-24
[1:49:05] xpert_demon69: we gonna drink the kool-aid for 10.2.6 #poisonous
[1:49:05] the_great_simonator: not during race?
[1:49:07] TheEyeVII: @Squats3 if casual means not rated then you'd want world pvp events like sod or new bgs but i'd lean on the events more?, i'm not the target for that so idk
[1:49:08] Aradour: Hey Max, What class/spec do you respect the most? As in, when you see someone playing it well, you respect them for it? Or with modern wow that doesn't really cross your mind and it's more about the player?
[1:49:09] Baskkov: apart from race
[1:49:15] tydrera: @tydrera damn that sounds kinda boring, they're just gonna speedrun it
[1:49:15] monochromator: might actually stay subbed a whole season for the first time in like 10 years
[1:49:27] Artheeri: truck simulator ofc
[1:49:33] bananomon_: variety!
[1:49:34] thenateo2: @Artheeri euro or american tho
[1:49:34] inklein_: FFXIV is that way and the community recently turned to inventing drama to make content
[1:49:35] leubinator: @Maximum have u talked about skyline and bdg disbanding
[1:49:40] TheEyeVII: could the skull thing be RETAIL HARDCORE nowaying?!
[1:49:40] crolo0: 10.2.6 : massive player layoffs FeelsDankMan
[1:49:41] madoxstudios: Honestly I would be happier w/ a shorter season 4 if it leads to better future expansion content. So far I haven't been a huge fan of old raid cycles while waiting for new content.
[1:49:42] theDirtyon3: Old Max would have played a variety game @Maximum Sadge
[1:49:44] exomaths: Do we know what "dragonflight raids revisited" mean in S4?
[1:49:52] punkekw: ???
[1:49:53] leubinator: i heard about it
[1:49:55] inklein_: BDG did WHAT
[1:50:00] Jagardo: is bdg bricked?
[1:50:01] leubinator: nothing offical tho
[1:50:04] spookylock: I heard about it too
[1:50:06] ASwarmOfBees: Didn't they just lose their sponsor?
[1:50:07] payloon: time for shopping max
[1:50:07] DunzoCD: Sadge
[1:50:11] Kripttyk: everythign on the internet is real though
[1:50:12] xpert_demon69: I know a guy that knows a guy
[1:50:12] theDirtyon3: i heard too :)
[1:50:13] Denz_9: it came to him in a dream
[1:50:15] Aveloud: what is gonna happen dh hero talents? one tree?
[1:50:17] niceadin: they just stoped rwf
[1:50:22] Shirey12: @Maximum What are you most excited for in then next expansion as a feature coming soon?
[1:50:24] Nalbaldian: I think they just stepped down from the world race?
[1:50:24] berchberkins: It's a genuine skill that you can make content out of those things also
[1:50:25] Madgeneto: source: made it up
[1:50:26] inklein_: I also heard about it (I'm deaf)
[1:50:27] Birraga: They havent recleared yet riht
[1:50:29] meatseekor: this past raid bricked many guiilds. bosses were too hard
[1:50:32] PJs_Banana: i def heard about echo buying out liquid too
[1:51:03] theDirtyon3: imperative PepeLaugh
[1:51:15] mtj66666: ghost gaming xd
[1:51:19] pokirane: @meatseekor amir?
[1:51:22] yuhhhhe: @Maximum  tf is that sound?
[1:51:22] inklein_: guys I heard WoW is shutting down is that true Sadge
[1:51:27] DBGmal: sounds like grinding coffee?
[1:51:28] pokirane: @mtj66666 xdd Anvil xdd Blas0n
[1:51:28] theDirtyon3: Vauum YEP
[1:51:29] Ronfendo: I bet GG gave them a Brick load of money
[1:51:30] Birraga: They lost so many players pre this patch too
[1:51:34] bobsxo: kinda like GG dropping the move
[1:51:35] KaptinKazual: Don't forget about how much of their roster is gone.
[1:51:50] TheEyeVII: @inklein_ ya it's done, ignore the next 3 xpacs announced
[1:51:58] SneakyWoodPecker: esports bubble has burst
[1:52:01] Mtngs: Your dogs are real chill around a vacuum cleaner
[1:52:12] Gamerhcp: isnt that ID now
[1:52:13] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[1:52:19] theDirtyon3: yoink
[1:52:20] TotallyNotillu: Do you with RWF winner and top 3 should be getting some sort of price money from blizzard? Same like AWC and MDI?
[1:52:21] IamBadSry: @inklein_ yea, shut's down tomorrow. It's over Sadge
[1:52:27] Shirey12: @Maximum What has you the most bricked up for the new expansion? (other than raids)

[1:52:49] RAF_Sean: I was surprised that Robin stayed away for 2 tiers
[1:52:55] Madgeneto: or they dont xdd
[1:53:01] bobsxo: ID is like the minor leagues - get to liquid or echo or go down and slam for fun
[1:53:06] JustDudu: When will Blizzard start funding RWF ?
[1:53:20] bobsxo: @RAF_Sean Has he said hes coming back to it?
[1:53:23] SavageFromSpace: tindral killed them
[1:53:27] reggiepowa: Aware
[1:53:28] Ronfendo: 1k pulls on birdman

[1:53:34] peanutbutterandpancakes: T Swift Aware
[1:53:38] ratgefingah: what dungeons yall think we getting in s4?
[1:53:58] daevyfan: @JustDudu neither liquid or echo are willing to give up the money they make from creating their own events
[1:53:58] Madgeneto: @kingbrthur sll df ones
[1:54:00] xWB1: xWB1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:54:02] Nox1o: they do like just throwing their bodies at the bosses
[1:54:03] Madgeneto: @kingbrthur all*
[1:54:03] SeraphimSentinel: @kingbrthur I feel like its gonna be all DF dungeons but i REALLY hope its not
[1:54:06] KaptinKazual: Skyline was funded.. but some of their issue was roster depth and connection problems I think.
[1:54:07] tolarianweave: Hi Max, how do you deal with people getting mad at you for leadership decisions you've made in WoW?
[1:54:07] TheFamilyHorde: The S1 & S2  DF dungeons

[1:54:15] theDirtyon3: built shitty Sadge
[1:54:19] bergy101: without global release china can never compete
[1:54:29] Mr_Sir_Diggity: article site financial burden and exhaustion
[1:54:30] Shirey12: What excites you the most on the roadmap?
[1:54:31] Team_Spanky: Also arent they a Chinese guild playing on a Taiwan server
[1:54:34] theDirtyon3: LUL
[1:54:37] meatseekor: oh likek internet problems?
[1:54:40] rustandsawdust: I missed last stream, wtf finally happened with the whole mic static issue?
[1:54:43] minimi12001: yea bc theres no cn server anymore
[1:54:45] Hoaw: if u pull a boss 1k times, you just arent anywhere near WF level, you are just brute forcing
[1:54:48] alarkin: I mean even now tindral is commonly going into the 300s/400s for most guilds still working on the raid
[1:54:50] Faraday5001: didnt skyline actually have fist fights one raid?
[1:54:50] KaptinKazual: They were a chinese guild playing on Taiwanese servers.. they had to speed level/gear characters on new accounts since TW/CH dont share
[1:54:50] dankyou123: this zero content chart...rip
[1:54:59] antipheonixna: is skylines not the psycho streamer chinese guild who had all the wild stories? or diff guild?
[1:55:08] rhennen: where they the guild that disbanded mid raid and had some brawl in the player facility?
[1:55:08] garkovankovic: was kil'jaeden pulled 1000 times? @Maximum
[1:55:29] Pilha390: jaina
[1:55:40] Brobi: Halondrus without nerfs was probably more
[1:55:46] MrKray2: well their problem wasn‚Äôt quick boss resets
[1:55:47] Shiratory: Halondrus
[1:55:54] xpert_demon69: I bet fallen avatar would be into it
[1:56:06] ZACKandATTACK: Tindral's difficulty feels very frontloaded. Instantly requires 3 groups: Melee, Ranged, and Tanks who have to do something at around the same time or else you wipe
[1:56:08] minimi12001: jaina was nowhere near tindral difficulty lmfao?
[1:56:09] xdtai: tindral was or is unfair?
[1:56:12] bobsxo: halondrus was a GOOD hard
[1:56:13] wuggi_tv: wuggi_tv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:56:15] garkovankovic: was kil'jaeden pulled 1000 times? @Maximum
[1:56:16] bobsxo: tindral was just bullshit
[1:56:17] berchberkins: How would you compare halondrus to Tindral?
[1:56:31] alarkin: tindral is still bullshit lol it's just less bullshit
[1:56:36] yaboiq56: Good hard? >:)
[1:56:50] Team_Spanky: @Maximum you see Steve Danuser left the Warcraft team?
[1:56:50] greatangelsanguinius: Tindral was boring as to watch bc of the random wipes
[1:56:55] connymontana: what does dragonflight raid revisited even mean?? will raids get buffed or just better drops?
[1:56:56] Goats48: @Maximum Took my guild 559 pulls to kill Tindral
[1:57:19] Kripttyk: @connymontana fated season
[1:57:23] daevyfan: @greatangelsanguinius thats the same reason halondrus was fun to watch
[1:57:48] garkovankovic: is kil'jaeden still objectively the hardest boss in the history of wow?
[1:58:05] infosec_lover: HUH
[1:58:06] Reckless_Monk: Avatar is
[1:58:09] xpert_demon69: learned who they were Aware
[1:58:12] Ahrmanhamma: KJ was borked/overtuned enough that Method stopped pulling until Blizz changed it, so that doesn't really count
[1:58:12] connymontana: @Kripttyk aight thx
[1:58:18] Reckless_Monk: Avatar is the hardest
[1:58:28] muonz: the instant dollars gap now
[1:59:10] minimi12001: slg best boss Kappa
[1:59:15] leubinator: u got world 3rd stonelegion
[1:59:15] garkovankovic: hm not sure but i think kil'jaeden was surely harder than avatar
[1:59:30] Fizzbot125: You both killed SLG twice before any other guild did once
[1:59:35] bobsxo: SLG was just Tindral lite levels of bullshit tho lmao
[1:59:38] poroyou: are there any real contentious 3rds?
[1:59:41] poroyou: in your mind
[1:59:52] GrimFandango: yeah Instant Dollars is smurfing hard, its wild
[2:00:01] Zandrilx: Id v good
[2:00:07] bobsxo: oh yeah
[2:00:10] bobsxo: it was just bugged to shit
[2:00:20] NotD4k: i found that fight boring as hell
[2:00:29] Zarroe: garf
[2:00:30] fronkacean: slg last phase being effectively a one shot is so funny

[2:02:17] GrimFandango: wow Max must have been getting heavily Auged this fight Kappa
[2:02:20] bobsxo: Trill with the maxibabe details name is hilarious
[2:02:28] fronkacean: nick got his ass ate insane on this boss
[2:02:31] GrimFandango: @bobsxo oooo that's Trill, that makes sense
[2:02:33] XazzidTV: @GrimFandango that's trill
[2:02:46] GrimFandango: ty loremasters
[2:03:05] minimi12001: it got me for asec too like why is max in on the wf kill
[2:03:13] minimi12001: details name trolling

[2:03:34] NotD4k: MM hunters FeelsStrongMan
[2:03:35] Gamerhcp: wicky b
[2:03:46] fronkacean: this raid comp is so crazy
[2:03:48] Ponification: 1 of the hunters' details nicknames is great
[2:03:54] Elseworldz: Sounds kinda pvp-ish?
[2:03:56] fronkacean: 5 hunters, 3 dks, 2 palas, 2 wars
[2:03:57] iShadowFox: 5 hunters
[2:03:58] fronkacean: 2 shamans
[2:04:00] minimi12001: 3 dk 5 hunter
[2:04:10] leubinator: half of the killcomp isn't raiding in the guild anymore
[2:04:17] TCancelYO: Thats why you have a good RL :D
[2:04:22] jberry: am i looking at 5 hunters
[2:04:22] Clush___: @Maximum i miss ben
[2:04:23] Hoaw: 5 hunters and 3 dks. what an era
[2:04:35] LimeSLimeS: that just sounds super draining
[2:04:43] Theldro: @Hoaw and yall want raid buffs removed
[2:05:46] Hoaw: @Theldro true. not me though, i love raid buffs i think variety is good even if its "forced"
[2:05:59] huo_junzhang: Banned world named hunter TrollDespair
[2:06:04] lucashowmuchpain: wasnt there a bug where 1 ball could solo with some tech
[2:06:07] GnarstyTV: lmao details "Dogshit Ass game"
[2:06:10] Fevion24: MM was borken early Nathria
[2:06:29] the_great_simonator: so it spawned a random amount of mobs???
[2:06:35] Demazia: mm was so much fun in SL
[2:06:41] Brobi: Our haste was in the negatives back then
[2:06:45] nairb1: they better cook for season4 df or im tilted!!!
[2:06:49] poroyou: how much of this is figured out before the race if any?
[2:06:50] minimi12001: more like you needed to kill a certain #, and the spawn rate was very random
[2:06:51] fronkacean: also tindral had a last phase
[2:07:01] Ronfendo: pass fail mechanics like seeds aren't necessarily fun
[2:07:14] miraagex: tindral makes you respect its mechanics
[2:07:19] Lara_TV_: @Ronfendo It's fun when you pass them

[2:14:53] Fizzbot125: flex mythic sounds dogwater
[2:14:54] Elseworldz: Good thing I don't lift weights. Far for life, get at me.
[2:15:00] ratgefingah: 10 man raiding Pog
[2:15:02] sim967: yup
[2:15:04] Ahrmanhamma: Flex is just another hurdle to a well tuned boss
[2:15:05] MrPhelan: Bring back 10m raiding.
[2:15:08] Oracle_WoW: lots of mythic mechanics wouldnt work on flex
[2:15:09] KaisenSiru: YEP
[2:15:10] zuyaaaaaa: 10 man echo of neltharion would be a joke
[2:15:22] Hoshma46: 10 players in heroic fyrakk had the same number of orbs as 30 man for a while PepeLaugh
[2:15:27] goekenaitor: so true
[2:15:28] Hoaw: dont make it flex raiding, just bring back 10/20 10/25 man
[2:15:30] Wildfire_Gaming: PepegaPhone NEW META
[2:15:36] RamblingJosh_: 10 man raszageth poggers
[2:15:36] wowtrucker: They can do 10 man mythic with the state of class buffs. Just won't work
[2:15:38] Aakku: Just want redundant class buffs for xmas someday
[2:15:43] Ereckshun: Isn't that what happened when they introduced it?
[2:15:43] wowtrucker: Cant*
[2:15:45] Ponification: Why not scale it up to 25 and not below 20?
[2:15:50] Moodann36: heroic fyrakk was easier with more people until the nerf
[2:15:51] nairb1: get every raid buff and go with that xdd
[2:15:58] Rafaelfrost_: @Maximum talks about M+ and what groundbreaking changes would be nice to breeath new air to that genre

[2:16:07] MrPhelan: 2/4/12
[2:16:09] leubinator: 2/4/14 andies
[2:16:09] MrPhelan: :)
[2:16:12] RaD_762: Smolderon is a perfect example
[2:16:13] HansGuckIndLuft: thats only for loot no?
[2:16:14] tristrum88: 2/3/9 etc
[2:16:14] notriagaming: @maximum could talk about % of the playerbase that ends up getting cutting edge and whether or not you think thats high or low enough. Is this an issue you think that can be solved by something other than just nerfing the bosses
[2:16:16] slowfetch: ok boss to boss lockout at least
[2:16:19] Baskkov: it matters for loot
[2:16:20] dugy6: dont they do that for the drops
[2:16:24] Hoaw: dont make it flex raiding, just bring back 10/20 10/25 man
[2:16:28] darkgigaz: Do you think Blizzard will drop more hero talents next week?
[2:16:29] AstoriahFae: I thought it was for loot cutoffs
[2:16:34] Caseman984: Ratio in group finder listing just helps people know if group is full of their role or not
[2:16:37] Gardor: seed breakpoint at 15 where suddenly only one corrupted seed per roar spawns
[2:16:38] Elseworldz: yurp 2/4/9 iirc right?
[2:16:38] dugy6: nah but like its per 5
[2:16:56] GrimFandango: if the group isn't 2/4/12 I'm gonna throw myself off a bridge
[2:17:03] Baskkov: more people = less fps
[2:17:07] Ponification: I wish the lockouts were the same style as Heroic where you can run mythic more than once to kill bosses, but can't get loot twice
[2:17:07] basherbash32: More players = more rolls
[2:17:10] BANEguhIN: @Maximum I want 10 man M+ personally... would make it fun as hell imo
[2:17:12] the_great_simonator: it makes me so pissed off when I see a massive 480+ player in queue but the RL won't take em because "iT mEsSeS uP tHe RaTiO!"

[2:17:28] Madgeneto: true lol
[2:17:29] Orange_SM: the hardest part of mythic raiding is getting 20 good people
[2:17:32] BiblibobEUWest: 2/4/12 is the most degenerate pug thing ever, and you won't convince them otherwise. these are the people that kill 5 hc bosses every tier and think they are god gamers
[2:17:39] basherbash32: They rather have the optimal number for loot with less rollers
[2:17:45] joekandy: going to 30 in raids makes me want to die (& my comp)
[2:17:49] SovexFFXIV: they're ff14 players maybe eveionMiloPepega
[2:17:55] Hoshma46: 40 man mythic xdd
[2:17:59] poroyou: thats bc everyone assumes smart people figured out the ratio and blindly follow it
[2:18:00] Aakku: if they do more dps, than the boss gains from adding a person, its an improvement.
[2:18:06] Aakku: its just that simple lol
[2:18:09] Psyquest: Mythic raiding was super popular and very competitve when 10 man mythic was a thing
[2:18:11] Madgeneto: nowadays it's "to get more loot" and then you have to share it with more people KEKW
[2:18:21] antipheonixna: instead of flex mythic how about follower mythic, u fill 1-19 of ur raid with ai npcs who only know giga dam @Maximum
[2:18:24] Eggmackan: Isnt the ratio about how many loot pieces u get?
[2:18:31] Ponification: I've had people on my team absolutely screech about their FPS dropping to 2 on fights like Nymue and Fyrakk when we ran 30man
[2:18:33] poroyou: What position do you play in hockey (if it has positions, I dont know hockey)
[2:18:37] Artheeri: KEKW

[2:18:44] Kolatroll: hello sir
[2:18:44] sibrobro: banger
[2:18:53] wowtrucker: Only about 50k people good enough to get CE anyways.
[2:19:03] RaD_762: follower raid replace lfr
[2:19:03] Kaimande: Kaimande subscribed with Prime. 
[2:19:08] Madgeneto: lfr should be followers
[2:19:09] JakeParkbench: What if it was 19 clones of Ben
[2:19:10] Hoshma46: That's what LFR is already
[2:19:12] leubinator: as long as ai isn't trained on lfr players
[2:19:19] seaabastian: Soloing raid with 19 npcs? you just described LFG
[2:19:26] Rapunzele: Why dont we just make WoW a single player games and turn it into the witcherxElden ring
[2:19:26] seaabastian: LFR*
[2:19:27] xPriamx: make that 20 is the sweet spot in flex mythic
[2:19:29] Rapunzele: LOL
[2:19:30] expo513: @maximum flex raid below 20 means if we miss a couple dps we don‚Äôt cancel raid or prog
[2:19:33] poroyou: its cool tech
[2:19:37] reggiepowa: the only time I used it when I needed someone to heal me for legendary quest
[2:19:44] Raaeni: id like follower legacy raids, especially uldir since you still cant solo mythrax
[2:19:48] Morinik: My idea is they are going to put followers into all the old "classic" expacs then we we can play all the games forever :)
[2:19:50] MrPhelan: @expo513 YEP
[2:19:53] Kripttyk: i have nevber done follower dungeon coz i was told it was a waste on geared toons
[2:19:58] bigmeanbeefy: Maybe it can help pepole learn to get better too, since they fear doing something wrong in groups
[2:19:59] slider206x: any god gamers want to help me complete heroic amirdrassil for the first time? i dont get invited to lfg groups, so im asking here
[2:19:59] SkunkTruck: im trying to learn Disc priest for the first time, and follower dungeons are helpful setting up ui, learning the spec
[2:20:03] Wheva: Wheva subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! just bring jb onto the pod and talk about random stuff for an hour, its guranteed to be a banger
[2:20:23] Flenidalap: follower dungeons was a lot cooler then i thought
[2:20:24] nightst314: "What really grinds my gears"
[2:20:26] Jazzarus_: SoD is pretty fun rn, that could be your background while you talk instead of the wallpaper LUL
[2:20:29] LionButLeon: OMEGALUL LD
[2:20:31] CoffeeASAP: Bedge
[2:20:32] surpriseparty20: I mean some people wanna just log onto wow and press buttons . Let them chill
[2:20:35] Ronfendo: "JB Rants" that would be the title
[2:20:38] wowtrucker: @expo513 that will be less of an issue with cross realm opening from day one next xpac.
[2:20:39] aangkimoddi: KEKW
[2:20:49] AlphaBDK: Poddy C Max just flexes for an hour
[2:20:53] PJs_Banana: JB rant about no healer MDI runs lol
[2:20:54] kino_xo: Does the initial leveling area/scenario teach new players about kicks and defensives?
[2:20:59] CoffeeASAP: 7pm time for my old ass to hit the hay
[2:21:00] nellfin: secondary cat
[2:21:03] Madgeneto: "what grinds j's beans"

[2:57:04] reymargera: YEP
[2:57:05] Lorrdzik: lighting on the right
[2:57:08] valkor_10: max zoom though
[2:57:09] keenxp: spoilers
[2:57:09] c3rby_: Theres a command that lets you zoom out further
[2:57:09] Korupcija_: no, you need addon
[2:57:09] TheFamilyHorde: You can /consle to get extra
[2:57:10] bobsxo: left is default
[2:57:11] LostwuN: not just zooming out
[2:57:12] HYMSeb: wait for it
[2:57:12] oneifbyland: yes but a lot of people don't know how to change these settings or never have
[2:57:13] Rekiel_: default setting is kind of limited
[2:57:15] valkor_10: defauly ui doesn't have max zoom
[2:57:15] Madgeneto: max default distance is shorter than with addons
[2:57:15] everjaz: i actually changed all my settings and its been pretty poggies
[2:57:15] guynormally: leatrix does this for you, but you can do it w/o an addon
[2:57:17] kadashy1: need a console command for it
[2:57:18] clearsenpai_: you have to do the cvar
[2:57:18] thenateo2: thats like imfiredup
[2:57:19] LostwuN: it's more than just max zoom
[2:57:19] bobsxo: if you play on base UI you have to put in a console command
[2:57:20] Alarius_: dynamic cam, ez, done
[2:57:20] Azikielboi: yeah they all look the same
[2:57:22] RealDane: it's the pillar off of the platform far away
[2:57:23] ahri_feet_connoisseur: Afenaar UI
[2:57:23] BobAwesome: Default max zoom is 1. you can set it to 2.6 via /cvar
[2:57:25] Vitel__: looks like a Weak aura
[2:57:28] Piki9: increased fov past max zoom in game @Maximum
[2:57:28] alqallafi: naowhSWE naowhSWE naowhSWE
[2:57:33] Dyllabus: this isn't a ui video it's graphic settings
[2:57:37] Vordie: The suggestions are fairly basic aimed at the average player that won't bother too much
[2:57:40] surpriseparty20: No UI will ever beat that DH guy u reacted a while back @maximum
[2:57:51] Rekiel_: default zoom setting is limited and that console command is like unlock that limit
[2:57:52] Kamedosin: I know someone that swaps target and player Health positions
[2:58:00] lessahj: I have my target on the left. And my guild always is giving me grief for it.
[2:58:02] valkor_10: that's most people

[2:59:02] killswitch941: must be a shit gfx card
[2:59:03] Vordie: Part of the stupidity has to include the game
[2:59:04] Madgeneto: KEKW
[2:59:05] Theliahh: the game warns you before you turn that off, that's not default
[2:59:06] BigTrout3: just set the graphics qualities to 1 KEKW

[3:02:20] BigTrout3: 1 tick smaller than your display
[3:02:24] SkunkTruck: there is more to it
[3:02:24] XxZagixX: With the console command you don't have to lower the scaling
[3:02:28] NotD4k: i think they did
[3:02:28] ShaggySummers: there's a better way to do that sharpening now @Maximum
[3:02:28] Harry_barry_larry: i heard that this broke in dragonflight

[3:03:07] lovefoolish7: if sharpening makes the game look better its time to get glasses for the ingame camera
[3:03:08] Goats48: Hacker manz EZ
[3:03:09] Akidovo: @Maximum Check it at 100%, for me it looks hella bad
[3:03:11] RealDane: hack KEKW
[3:03:13] Docaan: wait max, let him farm watch time
[3:03:23] OG_Kawngi: HACKERMANS
[3:03:37] mangy9: This guy gives way too much exposition. It is driving me nuts
[3:03:37] bobsxo: go down to 91
[3:03:43] Theliahh: the game always sharpens when you are below 100 by default
[3:03:47] SkunkTruck: no, leave render scale lowere then 100
[3:03:49] Wafzig: I keep mine around 91
[3:03:50] Hoshma46: stay at 100 and then put in the command
[3:03:51] Theliahh: the console command makes it always sharpen regardless
[3:03:53] PolishBunny: If you dont have native resolution, aka 98, game will resample
[3:03:53] Alarius_: its because when you start scaling a post process gets applied
[3:03:55] reggiepowa: I dont notice shit
[3:03:56] c3rby_: The recommendation is to go as low as you can that you can tolerate
[3:04:07] oneifbyland: @mangy9 you might have issues. turn your monitor off. problem solved
[3:04:07] OG_Kawngi: hacked HACKERMANS
[3:04:23] Theliahh: "Resample Sharpness" is the setting
[3:04:24] AyeLoud: Put contrast on 75% too
[3:04:24] HYMSeb: I put it on 91% and lost like 60 fps
[3:04:25] PolishBunny: so it always "resamples" even if there is nothing to resample?
[3:04:26] mangy9: @mangy9 Not Max you dingus the youtube
[3:04:27] AyeLoud: and you win
[3:04:32] Docaan: Max Computer Accessed HACKERMANS
[3:04:32] Pelleus323: You have to type
[3:04:39] Hoshma46: it basically sets it to always do it even if you havent used resampling
[3:04:56] OXDOX: after season 3 started the 99% tanked my fps and i gained 100 fps from putting it back to 100%
[3:04:58] BobAwesome: Mechanic Clarity in Nymue KEKW
[3:05:02] SkunkTruck: ya
[3:05:12] bobsxo: @OXDOX There was a bug that he addresses

[3:06:45] AyeLoud: 1070 gang
[3:06:45] darthrako: @Maximum Now, a good graphics card is good, but having a great CPU helps a ton too.
[3:06:46] monochromator: 1050 TI gang
[3:06:46] IamBadSry: ok ill take 5
[3:06:48] Bug_Byte: I have a 4070 and i was lagging on tindral roots

[3:06:52] ItsMeCynch: why 1x 4090, get 3x 4090s
[3:06:54] BobAwesome: I went from a 1070 to a 7800xt
[3:06:55] RealDane: but in the case of wow, it's not about how many cores you have. it's about how fast is each core
[3:06:56] Bug_Byte: Upgraded my processor and had no issues

[3:09:03] SAMBBA1: @bobawesome compare those 2 and other one is shitty.
[3:09:15] AyeLoud: The other real significant thing is Contrast. The rest is just different settings depending on performance. Nothing to worry about with a 4090

[3:27:20] xK3V1N4T0Rx: @Maximum lets settle this war in chat, pineapple belongs on pizza right?
[3:27:21] Docaan: dude any person that recommends pineapple on pizza is trolling or have dead tastebuds and no sense of smell

[3:28:47] RealDane: see chat, he's saying similar things. you pay, state things you want or not want to be done = they should do exactly that for a fee.

[3:31:36] RealDane: @oneifbyland not true at all. it's just common sense that if you plan to work in a foreign country, no matter how long, you should either learn that country lanuage or english which is main in the world. being a tourist in foreigh country is a totally different thing, but still most tourists learn eng!

[3:32:08] oneifbyland: 49ers had their wakeup call. it's gonna be a stomp over the Chiefs
[3:32:09] NoLimitsNick: I got a friend who plays on special teams for the 49ers so I'm picking them.
[3:32:11] Jarlan23: the quarterback show on netflix made me not like mahomes

[3:33:37] thoromyr19: rooting for Chiefs but would love to see Purdy win (my Eagles are out so anything goes)
[3:33:43] Piki9: if he and trey lance had swapped draft positions, no one would hate as much
[3:33:53] LonePuma: True actually
[3:33:55] LonePuma: Based take
[3:34:10] fzybny: Pulling for the Chiefs only because of the TSwift drama if they win would be amazing content.
[3:34:10] sim967: I'm rooting for McCaffery
[3:34:42] NoLimitsNick: After what Purdy did to the Lions in the 2nd half. He proved he's an MVP. The hate is so unwaranted.
[3:34:45] BobAwesome: KC is gonna change their name from the Chiefs to the Swifts.
[3:34:51] Piki9: I think its just because the first game she went to, they showed her a lot
[3:34:53] impurehalo: no one would even register it
[3:34:57] Thasin22: its only because its KC
[3:34:59] cyberklinos: @thoromyr19 he is definitely going to if he wins and if not they are still going to pay him. You just pay your franchise QBs and he is just one of them. Everyone else hating on him are haters. Very sorry haters.
[3:35:00] ANNTtv: early in the season I think it was a lot worse
[3:35:01] Piki9: and people lost their minds and wont let it go
[3:35:03] bcubedad: D:

[3:35:06] Fenrorr: Wasnt Brady like a 6th round draft? Kinda weird that people still hold it against Purdy
[3:35:09] Thasin22: kc*
[3:35:09] SayNoToStim: They show Eminem, and us Detroit fans would point out that Eminem > Swift
[3:35:11] Chronine: sounds like something a swiftie would say
[3:35:21] crudolol: people have too much time and/or are bored to care about shit like that
[3:35:22] BobAwesome: I love how mad it makes people
[3:35:23] highcard2: @Jarlan23 vegas
[3:35:29] paragorr: the right is mad that she got young people to register to vote lol.
[3:35:49] LonePuma: @Fenrorr People called brady a system QB for years. He really didn't start to get league wide respect till his 3rd-4th SB win.
[3:35:51] OG_Kawngi: the 'do you know who travis kelce is' one?
[3:35:57] thoromyr19: omg that shit was hilarious
[3:36:09] bcubedad: that was a great bit
[3:36:10] Fenrorr: @LonePuma thats wild
[3:36:21] NoLimitsNick: That is fucking awesome!
[3:36:24] Zlynnt: I had a customer come into work today and tried to rant to me about "Taylor swift ruining football" I just had to stand there and smile.
[3:36:27] impurehalo: tbh i had never heard of him until he started dating her, but i don't follow football at all
[3:36:35] AnesthesiaFC: AnesthesiaFC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! but he is an all pro tight end
[3:36:42] winterstretch: she also did make him massively more famous though right?
[3:36:42] Jarlan23: they'll break up and swift will wrong an album about it
[3:36:44] MBG_95: it was also funny when the men reversed it, swiftys got mad
[3:36:47] Jarlan23: write*
[3:36:57] OG_Kawngi: :)
[3:37:03] JackOfAllApocalypses: wrong an album is...kind of great

[3:38:04] Spartanate: Remember the Kid Rock thing/
[3:38:04] crappacinno: After they bought it all
[3:38:07] huntermain123: KKona
[3:38:09] asgoel13: don't they have to buy the cans to pour them out in the first place?
[3:38:10] MVPBuster: MUH BEER KKona
[3:38:11] BobAwesome: We're gonna go buy this other piss beer (that's also owned by the same company that owns bud light)
[3:38:13] MrChaCho: Not a cult though, so that's good
[3:38:13] racinnette: they didn't even do an ad they just sent a special can, crazy
[3:38:13] miceinmyveins: terrible call by the bud light owner tbh gotta know your audience lol it tanked their company for a little
[3:38:14] RemwayTV: I just like that they bought bud lite to pour it out
[3:38:14] CladeusXE: like the xbox andys
[3:38:15] JackOfAllApocalypses: it's not a good movie either 8(
[3:38:18] expo513: Remember when they lost their shit about kneeling? KEKW

[3:38:31] Mtngs: Is bud light a popular beer?
[3:38:36] NoLimitsNick: Bud light is trash anyway LUL
[3:38:39] winterstretch: honestly - a bunch moved to a different beer in protest made by the same company
[3:38:40] sim967: I had been boycotting Bud Light my entire adult life, so no difference to me
[3:38:49] nemziac: doubly hilarious because all the light beers are basicaly owned by the same distribution company
[3:38:53] nemziac: or supplier
[3:38:55] bcubedad: Miller Lite is my go to, a nice tall crispy boy
[3:38:59] MVPBuster: @Boreall hey alot of them moved to texas tyvm Madge
[3:39:00] Jarlan23: @Mtngs its probably the most popular beer in america just guessing tho
[3:39:05] Orenria: hey any horde scribes on stormrage wanna help me with my fyrakk axe quest
[3:39:13] theDirtyon3: yep
[3:39:16] OG_Kawngi: Anheuser-Busch
[3:39:16] DreadfuryDK: You boycott Bud Light because they hired a Trans actor. I boycott Bud Light because I think it tastes like carbonated piss. We are not the same.
[3:39:17] theDirtyon3: ANNHEISER BUSCH
[3:39:20] JackOfAllApocalypses: there's 2 companies, iirc
[3:39:24] medzwow: its AB,, AA, and standard
[3:39:24] BigTrout3: MOST name brand products are all owned by like 5-8 companies
[3:39:31] highcard2: AB does own a lot of brands tho

[3:39:38] medzwow: the three main companies
[3:39:39] pjcurtin: theres 2 really that own everything
[3:39:41] calldacawps: anheuser busch and miller coors
[3:39:49] thoromyr19: look up all the AB beers they have
[3:39:50] Alarius_: then theres like diageo and what not
[3:39:51] joekandy: miller coors
[3:39:54] Bigdamx: Hey, what are your thoughts on avoidance/leech gear?
[3:39:54] IamBadSry: KEKW at thinking companies have morals when it comes to marketing. If it will make them money. They don't care where the ad's show up.
[3:40:07] JackOfAllApocalypses: lol
[3:40:08] GoodyGodfather: Oh no
[3:40:12] daevyfan: the first season is abit slow
[3:40:12] GoodyGodfather: He got to you
[3:40:13] Caseman984: Expanse owns hard
[3:40:13] OG_Kawngi: that guerilla marketing worked on max
[3:40:14] JackOfAllApocalypses: that guy got you
[3:40:19] Jarlan23: its a pretty good show
[3:40:21] MBG_95: maybe that guy was right
[3:40:25] cyberklinos: Purdy looks likes like a way too normal and down to earth dude. That‚Äôs why he is taking so much heat. He doesn‚Äôt fit the persona of that charismatic all encompassing face of the franchise guy. You could run across him at the supermarket and would never imagine him being the dude leading the allstar team the 49ers have.
[3:40:26] daevyfan: third is bonkers
[3:40:32] daevyfan: third season^

[3:40:47] JackOfAllApocalypses: it was a good show, from what I saw of it, but that guy is the worst kind of fan
[3:41:00] Benjg7: but Kirk cousins is the same way
[3:41:00] bcubedad: Purdy looks like Lee Harvy Oswald
[3:41:02] asgoel13: have you seen the twitter meme where people are saying brock purdy looks like lee harvey oswald
[3:41:02] kallisz: @mau5_mask what show are we talking about?
[3:41:06] Valkrien09876: !ui
[3:41:07] Benjg7: and people respect kirk
[3:41:08] gloop1: holden is insanely annoying character
[3:41:14] juliwestside: Herbert has that type of personality.
[3:41:18] pnguinwow: yo started watching foundation and that shit is fire
[3:41:25] MBG_95: I thought Americans like underdog storys, why dont they like him?
[3:41:33] Fray24_: I saw his college highlights I refuse to believe it's the same guy
[3:41:34] AndyBoyLIVE: dorki
[3:41:46] Piki9: Jimmy G and Trey Lance couldnt do it with that team
[3:41:46] pjcurtin: he 100% uses pocket protectors
[3:41:53] Benjg7: no football team is good in the nfl with a trash qb
[3:41:54] darthrako: I am an ISU alum and Purdy kinda carried that team (although Breece Hall is a god).
[3:41:56] NoLimitsNick: Look at the 18-1 Patriots.
[3:42:05] JackOfAllApocalypses: fuckin brady had the best receivers in history w/him for 99% of his career
[3:42:05] zotaus: you 49ers or KC ?
[3:42:06] iamthegodcomplex: peyton
[3:42:07] Benjg7: you can have the best receiver in the league and someone still has the throw the ball
[3:42:11] OG_Kawngi: putting it down now, Consellation on Apple TV+ will be a hetaer
[3:42:16] OG_Kawngi: Constellation*
[3:42:19] NoLimitsNick: @Benjg7 Look at the 2000 Ravens my guy
[3:42:22] Jarlan23: good quarterbacks make their own weapons
[3:42:22] Richadin: trent dilfer = trash
[3:42:36] Fray24_: ad
[3:42:37] Piki9: Purdy was actually a projected 1st round pick after his 2nd year of college too
[3:42:40] Baerhug_: I just hoping its a good watch
[3:42:41] bcubedad: monkaW
[3:42:58] Mtngs: NOTED
[3:43:04] JohntheBarbarian: the bear?
[3:43:05] zach_jw: Purdy still drives a Toyota Sequoia lmao
[3:43:11] tchikaboom: sounds like interstellar
[3:43:12] OG_Kawngi: baseg pay up Apple
[3:43:13] JackOfAllApocalypses: ooh...noomie rapace is great

[3:43:38] jaydoeshair: blacklisttttt.  ant wait for next season
[3:43:42] McFarad: for all manking is amazing
[3:43:44] kniftty: Apple TV series are great so far
[3:43:48] McFarad: mankind*
[3:43:49] zeitgeiz: slow horses is so good
[3:43:50] JackOfAllApocalypses: hmm...maybe I ditch hbo and pick up apple tv
[3:43:53] ephemerisone74: @WarWesker88 blacklist is soo dragged out. it dies off in like season 4.

[3:44:16] CladeusXE: blacklist was good for like 5 seasons
[3:44:22] WarWesker88: @ephemerisone74 big true, i enjoyed it in the early seasons too
