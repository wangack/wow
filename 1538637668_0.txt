[2:59:17] Pallyofhell: debating if i want to get elden ring or not
[2:59:20] KyleCBE: Honestly, I feel like Blizz should've done an alternate story line for classic but keep the mechanics the same. Similar to how Oldschool Runescape deviated from Runescape 3. If they follow the same timelines.. then it will just be a sever where people run the same content over and over again. but if they want classic to last then they need to take the game in a direction that keeps the integrity of the game the way people remember and loved with, but with new and fresh content.

[3:41:55] Pallyofhell: yes
[3:42:11] hazey_17: good
[3:42:24] Pallyofhell: you will know how puts time into the class and who doesnt

[3:44:58] hazey_17: yh i think there starter zone has to be PRETTY fleshed out and not rushed to get used to all thoses spells, cus if u unlock all your talents n abilityes too quick without some examples and a nice zone to show the class, then it'll be way to overwhelming i feel
[3:45:39] Pallyofhell: its gonna be overwhelming if they dont release evoker during the pre patch
[3:45:55] hazey_17: yh true
[3:45:57] hazey_17: big fax

[3:46:50] Killshotqt: @Swifty lol about to jump in that disc lol
[3:47:03] Pallyofhell: no pre patch will bring all the new talents

[3:52:33] Pallyofhell: 500% of spell power in dmg on 1 talent
[3:52:41] nimeon01: uhr_huckleberry because few people are in the alpha I guess
[3:52:49] hazey_17: XDD
[3:53:07] hazey_17: unless every 1 getting a fat raw buff overral
[3:53:16] EliBourne: @galdrena thanks
[3:53:16] Pallyofhell: on a 9 sec cd that costs 1% mana you can make a disc priest hate life
[3:53:19] hazey_17: idk tho i aint seen all the other talents
[3:53:34] nimeon01: isnt it always like that though new class comes out its way overtuned
[3:53:54] hazey_17: yeah then gets washed down under
[3:54:07] qalennor: love your stream. Love from Pakistan
[3:54:08] hazey_17: but i think its different cus of the new technology in this xpac
[3:54:25] hazey_17: so it'll be really if they can actually tune ALL classes in 5 months

[3:54:26] hazey_17: really

[3:56:02] Pallyofhell: the final talents are pretty crappy tho
[3:56:12] nimeon01: I still wish every spec wasnt just a slot machine and hit everything that glows
[3:56:13] Pallyofhell: movespeed or a stun
[3:56:21] Pallyofhell: nothing really impactful
[3:56:28] nimeon01: but sadly it doesnt seem like they are doing anything about that
