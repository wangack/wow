[1:03:42] venruki: i didnt! that's op if you're all east coast
[1:03:45] venruki: big advantage
[1:03:45] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:03:45] zachgamegodx: I think this many ddos attacks in a week should indicates that ppl are not happy with the game atm
[1:04:01] cdewx: /cast [@cursor] earthen wall totem /wm [@cursor]1 /ping @cursor /stopcasting
[1:04:04] pharmztko: :-(
[1:04:05] EFFSIN: lets be honest
[1:04:07] EFFSIN: Dh
[1:04:10] desmondmmoore: Savage lol
[1:04:14] biofreaks: water boy mes
[1:04:14] Devcomz: lol
[1:04:19] brewtank: @cdewx when do we get to see some cdew x ven 3s though?
[1:04:27] zachgamegodx: trill on fywnne pog
[1:04:48] mayfire15: ven streams at night sometimes
[1:04:55] brewtank: ngl the dh/outlaw/healer comp looks really fun that you guys have been playing
[1:05:00] Juliio29: bring back the 3 amigos for a que sesh
[1:05:06] EFFSIN: watched fury war outlaw today
[1:05:20] zachgamegodx: ven said dragon was gonna be the best healer what the hell happened @venruki
[1:05:21] brewtank: shocked only now ppl are playing it when u think about it
[1:05:32] mayfire15: the move didn’t like it
[1:05:36] venruki: to be fair it was nerfed before the patch came out....
[1:05:36] mayfire15: rogue dh
[1:05:41] sharpdressedman15: i just chop like 500 calories of cheese off the block
[1:05:44] Stormayqt: honestly the only thing more OP than outlaws are in laws
[1:06:29] brewtank: yep
[1:06:46] gregl__: ps remove fistweaver
[1:06:56] thinkablelol: tru thats why i play blood dk
[1:06:58] zachgamegodx: I don’t think there’s anything they can do for them without a rework in high level play. no amount of healing is going to make up for them getting cc’d most the game
[1:07:04] buffevoker: I still que my pres 20 shuffles a day and yell at the screen
[1:07:08] mvqq: hey there chuck wanna q?
[1:07:33] biofreaks: keep rshaman and rdruid as is. buff ALL the other healers.
[1:07:34] Aimed57: boom roasted
[1:07:36] Swishinn: LUL
[1:07:37] dooshken: D:
[1:07:39] pharmztko: KEKW
[1:07:41] brewtank: @biofreaks agreed
[1:07:41] mvqq: :(
[1:07:45] Devcomz: Yeah I hear from a few others as well what you just said buff bad healers. They also say nerf Dh too
[1:07:50] Rudarz: @mvqq he meant it
[1:07:55] Cybernytez: holy shit xd
[1:08:12] Devcomz: but wouldnt buffing bad healers  be good into Dh
[1:08:21] Devcomz: and then people wont complain about it
[1:08:27] Cybernytez: whut
[1:08:27] mvqq: clipped and now my sub sound
[1:08:29] pharmztko: true
[1:08:39] brewtank: @mvqq lol
[1:08:54] mnowpsn: 100% it makes sense
[1:08:54] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:08:54] nicholas_names: I wish they would do that with healers
[1:08:57] dooshken: so true
[1:08:57] ionlyplaymetas: UH dk being a huge example of this
[1:08:57] venruki: the game is slow for other reasons
[1:08:57] mnowpsn: I agree
[1:09:08] Rudarz: need a 50% starsurge buff
[1:09:15] sharpdressedman15: heresy! burn him!
[1:09:18] mvqq: agreed @rudarz
[1:09:22] buffevoker: Game feels slow with outlaw in the lobby
[1:09:26] Dezignat3: cds need to be worse and overall dmg higher
[1:09:26] venruki: stamina buff - dh/outlaw being completely immune to death
[1:09:27] Devcomz: I think sub and Outlaw are really good with Dh but everytime I see Assa rogues they seem to flop hard
[1:09:27] Rudarz: @mvqq im tryna make a montage
[1:09:28] zachgamegodx: you’re not wrong, I think the meta that would develop would be awful if dh and rogue get nerfed
[1:09:31] Swishinn: warriors still hitting the same numbers they were in s2
[1:09:34] Swishinn: 30 ilvls higher
[1:09:47] pharmztko: samiBoom samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS1 samiSS2
[1:09:53] mvqq: I got some clips @rudarz
[1:10:00] zachgamegodx: ye
[1:10:01] venruki: I think making every spec as ridiculous as outlaw/dh creates an insane arms race
[1:10:08] Exzistancetw: respect it
[1:10:49] zachgamegodx: they do need to gut immo  aura dispel and outliers like this
[1:10:50] venruki: lots of specs do feel as good as outlaw/dh - the problem for stuff like WW (which does absurd damage) is it can actually die, can be kited, etc
[1:10:55] JaeDee: Yeah im mad enhance some booty
[1:10:59] chaos_jeeves: do you find it odd how pure dps classes (EG warrior + lock) outheal hybrid classes (EG ret paladin, sham)
[1:11:05] Lamatastisch: Buff DK Madge
[1:11:33] dooshken: based
[1:11:34] venruki: dh can also backflip accross the entire map immune to cc
[1:11:36] Rudarz: idk if anyone would be mad if deep freeze/fist stun got added back
[1:11:45] coke_vanilla: what specs are way too far down the tier list in your opinion?
[1:11:45] mvqq: DH just needs to be squishy and have to rely on leech to survive
[1:12:00] zachgamegodx: parry fists + stun fists would be so broken
[1:12:15] Meadamemnon: @chaos_jeeves its been like that since legion
[1:12:32] Devcomz: Ferals Assa Rogue Aff Lock Holy priest pres evoker and there are probably a couple others like Frost Dk that could really use some loving. Looking at the representation these seem to be the lowest
[1:12:36] Aimed57: ven new pvp dev @ blizzard when?
[1:12:37] Haraw: What you said is exactly why I personnaly dont like retail anymore, everyclass tends to have the same things
[1:12:57] venruki: its interesting because mitigation doesn't show as healing but its basically as effective
[1:13:07] mvqq: true every class is an abstraction of the same base kit
[1:13:07] venruki: imagine how much damage DH passive bullshit showed up on details
[1:13:15] venruki: would be more than a healer
[1:13:16] Lamatastisch: What do you think they could do about DKs? I think they are in a really weird spot most of the time.
[1:13:25] mynameistwavis: how long u been sitting in q
[1:13:55] Lamatastisch: Sadge
[1:13:55] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[1:14:07] Mechgyrasaur: I think they should buff blur and make a longer cd feels so dumb dhs can blur every 1 min
[1:14:08] mvqq: DKs are the most oppressive class when they’re good
[1:14:12] VitoBambino: not more of a joke than my survival hunter <333 /cry /cry /cry
[1:14:17] swolecolemole: they out here nerfing rotten touch, apoc, wound dmg, coil dmg but letting 300k blade dances slide
[1:14:18] swolecolemole: seems good
[1:14:21] ionlyplaymetas: casters will still tell you DK is “the anticaster” class lmfao delusional
[1:14:32] thinkablelol: @VitoBambino wym surv p strong
[1:14:34] venruki: O_o
[1:14:35] dooshken: DK has to spec into all of their CC
[1:14:35] Devcomz: Dks just need a redesign tbh at this point especially Frost
[1:14:39] ryanblue98: my server crashed
[1:14:43] tavdad: whole game is lagging
[1:14:46] lakehouseguy: do you ever get bored from WoW? I’m feeling like taking a break
[1:14:50] Dezignat3: bring back dks increasing cds of enemies
[1:14:54] Dezignat3: LOL
[1:14:59] Devcomz: I think servers are bugged my friend in discord has been in a shuffle q for an hour and 20 min
[1:15:02] dooshken: rogue gets most of their CC for free while DK has to spec into all of theirs
[1:15:02] pharmztko: O_o
[1:15:04] mvqq: I’ll snipe u w Jaime and hit 40 kicks kid
[1:15:04] sharpdressedman15: you'll find out at the next youtube reaction video
[1:15:08] Hakash: Bring back necro hit
[1:15:16] VitoBambino: @thinkablelol in season 1 maybe, I don't think a single hunter spec is viable at the highest level
[1:15:22] venruki: im not, i respect your opinion a lot
[1:15:29] zachgamegodx: vens observing the procedures
[1:15:30] Devcomz: Nah Im the stupid one
[1:15:31] venruki: but i cant imagine everything being on DH/outlaw level
[1:15:32] Devcomz: :D
[1:15:34] VitoBambino: as evidenced by it being absolutely nonexistent in tourneys and above like 2600 lol
[1:15:38] buffevoker: If we dont see any patch notes in 1 week im gonna take a break
[1:15:47] thinkablelol: @VitoBambino comparing the game to the highest level is silly, overall hunters are p good rn.
[1:15:53] mehhx: @buffevoker theres not going to be any changes
[1:16:00] mehhx: so enjoy ur break
[1:16:04] Aimed57: @mehhx LUL
[1:16:12] Devcomz: I think many are taking a break tbh until end of season at least
[1:16:14] lakehouseguy: the war within gonna be hyped
[1:16:20] Schwenkyytv: they worried about fixing sod
[1:16:25] mvqq: you got NA char still? @mehhx
[1:16:32] WardenDOTA: nerf aff locks and lower solo shuffle mmr
[1:16:33] mehhx: -
[1:16:41] buffevoker: @mehhx damn homie
[1:16:45] mvqq: :((
[1:17:17] Cybernytez: mehh doesnt waste too much letters
[1:17:23] sharpdressedman15: how do u die
[1:17:29] highgr4de: what is that spell that a green lazer goes onto a friendly target
[1:17:30] pharmztko: TOO E C
[1:17:40] Devcomz: @WardenDOTA I dont think Blizzard will change shuffle until its popularity dies down a ton

[2:01:49] hamsti: I know colorado has a similar plan (because i live here) dunno if/what other states are though
[2:02:41] Devcomz: its a free market if people dont buy em not much you can do they will just buy in neighboring states

[2:02:59] savagesdad87: facts
[2:03:05] hamsti: Yeah but i think they're banning the registration of them if they're new.

[4:04:40] dooshken: I really want to play classic but I'm doing stuff on retail
[4:04:49] stubbledorange: i think if anything it should require the same IP or something. they just don't want people account sharing is my guess. also imagine the bots doing both versions LUL

[4:04:58] ADiDough: Yea I was disappointed they didn't have the feature when they released classic
[4:05:06] Kanoonen: Well they could make it cost more monthly? Like a lil increase
[4:05:23] dooshken: We already pay monthly for the game tho
[4:05:27] stubbledorange: i don't want them to get any ideas about a sub cost increase at all lol
