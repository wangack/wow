[0:24:26] Askesatan: Faking is so satisfying
[0:24:33] eu_kev: Totally agree, I dont mind that pvp is ignored happy that we get classic to enjoy arena's like how it was when we grew up. Only thing I hope for is now that we are on the dragonflight client with transmog/interface ect that they replace 5s in cata with the soloq. But unlikely they will give us that much dev time for pvp
[0:24:46] mrbigpizza: Pojke Rogue PoV today I see

[0:47:39] classic_zxc: Have u heard about Nothingnowhere? I guess you would like it
[0:47:50] breakyax: i wonder if rbgs are gonna have a scene in cataclassic or not
[0:47:55] shaycwe: @Dokkotter Same... i tried making new world arena's work...but after 500 hours i can confirm its a meme
[0:47:57] breakyax: im kinda hyped for capping there i

[0:48:48] d1vbno: new world arena is so trash
[0:48:51] d1vbno: its so troll
[0:48:51] Fiftyswen: riot's mmo is already dead before arrival....you don't have the Executive Producer and the Principal Game Designer leave the company mid development while everything is fine
[0:48:54] breakyax: gonna make it easier for us adhd people with 500 alts

[0:50:20] mrbigpizza: i am already looking forward to playin WoW in my retirement home
[0:50:26] shaycwe: I never played cata, is the arena's more balanced than wotlk is?
[0:50:27] Dokkotter: It's also cuz we're old pojke Kappa
