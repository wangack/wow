[5:25:22] mangobanana62: @Silkjet001 if you able to steal just like 300 euros from like 3-4 wallets 5 days a week then you earned 6000 euros and you don't have to pay a single cent of tax after it. If you just steal half of the time its still good.

[8:04:34] xalu_24: @Kusinator no poisonss
[8:04:40] Team_Apple_Juice: 1.8 for bigger mutilates, but higher armor means poison procs are worth more. in pvp slower dagger is still better
[8:04:57] ShaConee00: @Team_Apple_Juice true
[8:04:57] papipicaso: that rune seems terrible
[8:05:02] zanics: yeh if the armour thing is as bad as they say then mutilate damage is gonna be low af
