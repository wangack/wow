[2:43:11] flookguy: lol
[2:43:20] ambiotic: cata sucked at the start, thats why.  It got better during firelands but the launch was rough
[2:43:38] DevilSpire: Spine was horrible
[2:43:42] ambiotic: terrance of the endless springs
[2:43:46] Belgromm: cata was mad fun for pvp
[2:43:48] PidiaP: Trial of the Crusader worst raid by a lot
[2:43:48] ambiotic: and heart of fear
[2:43:49] firehawk73: Spine
[2:44:00] herculesrockefeller: worse expansions ->  BC, WOTLK, LEGION Kappa

[2:44:34] Daarksyde: @herculesrockefeller trolls still live?
[2:44:36] flookguy: what are your top 3
[2:44:50] falldrgn: Cata and WOD leveling were some of the best..
[2:44:52] Belgromm: wrath and cata 2 of my favorites fun dungeons and pvp
[2:45:03] skylaars: No one liked BFA, but that expac holds a special palce on my heart
[2:45:18] Uther_The_Lightbringer: what mop was better thanbfa wtf
[2:45:27] Sollice: In Retrospect BfA was top flight
[2:45:30] zysmos: BFA was good
[2:45:34] firehawk73: DF, Legion, MOP
[2:45:39] itsrambo: i do trade and services chat
[2:45:43] Sollice: I think people were bored already with Horde v Alliance
[2:45:47] devildriver1919: bfa was horrible, what are you smoking?
[2:45:48] zysmos: it was a big sleeper
[2:45:48] mavericks312: ppl may wait to get on cause there is maintence
[2:45:48] chriswrites: in area 52 i have not been able to find a crafter for weeks
[2:45:49] Eshel: DF has definitely set a bar going into the next one - it’s either going to be amazing or blech
[2:45:50] abracka_: it's probably because you're alliance side, find someone horde side and send them the WA from ur paladin
[2:45:52] Morgg54: what do you need crafted
[2:45:55] Daarksyde: MoP was so nice because it was a complete different experience/area with ideas and plots. It was out of the normal "let's return the old bosses all the time"
[2:46:00] Molvonos: I messaged Elly, on the chance she wakes up and sees it, but no promises.
[2:46:02] hisfrankness: Quick someone log on and make all the craft monies 🤣 LUL
[2:46:03] ambiotic: Essences and Corruption where some of the best systems ever
[2:46:10] Zeerdan: loved bfa music
[2:46:10] devildriver1919: i was a grinder, and i hated it
[2:46:11] mavericks312: top 3 is legion,DF,MoP
[2:46:13] svu3: Hated azerite armor.
[2:46:16] Heero_Effect: I liked BFA story
[2:46:17] flookguy: Bruh i hated BFA RNG was hot garbage
[2:46:19] Thomthousand: I need something to grind in Dragonflight. I have no clue what to do
[2:46:23] HaloS23: DF is on its way to  be #1 for me.
[2:46:29] falldrgn: yeah it was very much reward=effort
[2:46:35] FalconKline: can cross-realm/group craft with personal orders?
[2:46:36] Sollice: Targeted loot with essences
[2:46:37] PidiaP: Twilight dev go brrrrrrrr BrokeBack
[2:46:40] flookguy: is there anything in wow you wish you did but cant anymore?
[2:46:43] DunzoCD: BFA was so fun it had more side content than most expacs, people didnt like it because they were mandatory
[2:46:46] itsrambo: R3 infinite stars week 1 was wtf
[2:46:51] Noshpan: I think for me, from most I've enjoyed to least enjoyed, it would be Wrath, Legion, TBC, MoP, DF, BFA, SL, Cata, WoD. I never played when vanilla wasn't current, so it's not on the list. But I would probably place it before Shadowlands.
[2:47:01] ssjshoutya: @Towelliee i stopped playing dragonflight after first patch and i have no idea what to do now when i log in, can you tell me what to go for i did some quests but after that...
[2:47:04] abracka_: @Towelliee log onto your horde toon and find a crafter that way. log back onto your paladin and send that crafter the WA
[2:47:05] chukudu: challenge modes ?
[2:47:08] ambiotic: challenge mode golds in WOD
[2:47:10] Kinghorn: nazjatar was a shit show at launch, half the world quests not working and no flying bleh
[2:47:28] Valstraz19: can you send workorders cross realm?
[2:47:37] Sollice: Yeah but I think Naz was something pretty new for them in terms of zone design
[2:47:40] warrenny: You mean not enough free gear?
[2:47:41] luckfore: 8.2 was top tier patch
[2:47:57] DunzoCD: 8.2 was one of the best patches theyve released
[2:47:59] warrenny: Essences were annoying
[2:48:14] falldrgn: im ok with having to play through the quest lines to catch up.
[2:48:28] warrenny: # @dunzocd worst patch of bfa
[2:48:28] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[2:48:30] PidiaP: Timewalking SoO, yay or nay? Really wish it was ToT
[2:48:31] DevilSpire: Shadowlands was that way I feel
[2:48:44] skylaars: BFA zones were lit as well
[2:48:49] warrenny: @pidiap Best choice was soo
[2:49:06] ambiotic: Plus BFA had top tier raids
[2:49:13] Secondbreakfasttt: God azerite armor and essence backtrack was horrible
[2:49:24] warrenny: @ambiotic Bod was great
[2:49:30] warrenny: The rest eh
[2:49:33] manintheblack77: Did they buffed tanks?
[2:49:33] Sollice: Top tier dungeon design also in BfA
[2:49:36] warrenny: M+ was great tho
[2:49:47] Secondbreakfasttt: but i loved corruption
[2:50:00] DunzoCD: @warrenny agree to disagree, but the majority of people thought Nazjatar/mechagon were top tier
[2:50:10] ambiotic: Having Twilight dev as a tank was top wow gameplay for me
[2:50:23] abracka_: @Sollice tol dagor
[2:50:29] xziyn: @Sollice BfA simultaneously had the best and the worst dungeons lol
[2:50:39] smiles82: WOONS?
[2:50:50] DevilSpire: DF is the first expansion I haven’t played since dreanor
[2:50:51] warrenny: Loved reaping tho
[2:50:56] warrenny: Or was that 8.1
[2:51:31] Secondbreakfasttt: and i remembering one whoting myself with infinestar on mythic boss dont maul or sometinhg LUL
[2:51:38] Secondbreakfasttt: *Shot
[2:51:44] Derca_: i felt so buffed as a tank with corruption
[2:52:00] Zeerdan: corruption was fun as a tank.  skyrocket to top of dps meter with one good TD proc
[2:52:01] Thoreya: 8.2 on
[2:52:03] Thoreya: bfa was my shit
[2:52:11] Thoreya: essences <3
[2:52:19] Sollice: Shrine of the Storm is probably the only dungeon asthetically I didnt like. All of the other ones felt new and fresh they way they looked
[2:52:22] ambiotic: Then they listened to the wrong feedback and made shadowlands =X
[2:52:30] Thoreya: lucid dream for fire mage, vision of perfection for bm hunter oooo
[2:52:40] flookguy: what i hate about current gear system is when you downgrade a crest its a freaking one for one
[2:53:00] xziyn: Looks were fine, but Waycrest was a mess in how it played
[2:53:14] abracka_: just say you heard of the case on the news when they ask you to raise your hand
[2:53:18] HaxzorJimDuggan: you call every night and they tell you to stay home or come in
[2:53:20] PidiaP: Tell them you’re famous Kappa
[2:53:23] SmallzzIV: Yeah they will tell you if you have to report
[2:53:24] falldrgn: Instructions should be on the summons.
[2:53:25] TekReset: just tell them you think hes guilty and theyll dismiss you
[2:53:25] Eshel: I’m a weirdo - I loved my time I was on a jury lol
[2:53:29] hisfrankness: Ick! I hope they never call me for that. Makes me anxious even thinking of it
[2:53:36] Derca_: correct
[2:53:36] warrenny: # @xziyn witches was horrible
[2:53:43] SmallzzIV: I have been summoned twice and never had to report
[2:53:44] Thoreya: i had to do jury duty 2 years ago
[2:53:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: i had federal jury notice last year and i had to call nearly every night for a month
[2:53:50] Thoreya: it was actually cool. had some wild cases
[2:53:55] falldrgn: Depending on how its run.. its one day\one trial. if you call in and number doesn't get called  you should be good

[2:54:20] PotbellyGoat: I've been summoned 5 times. Served 3 times lol
[2:54:23] Thoreya: i was grand jury
[2:54:25] bubbles1489: you are standby in a pool
[2:54:32] PadidinJones: However long the judge decides you should stay
[2:54:35] HaxzorJimDuggan: grand jury deal with multiple cases for a whole month
[2:54:38] bubbles1489: until they decide how many jurors are needed for the selection process
[2:54:42] falldrgn: Federal\state and county are handled differently\
[2:54:47] warrenny: @falldrgn Really? I had to go for two weeks. Was there for two weeks didnt ge5 chosen till last 3 days
[2:54:49] Eshel: For me - I had to go through seating for two cases before I was picked for one
[2:54:51] Sollice: Yes
[2:54:55] flookguy: i had it once lawyer got real mouthy with me told him to watch his tone when talking to me and got dismissed lol
[2:54:59] abracka_: just ask your lawyer how to get out of it tbh lol
[2:54:59] TekReset: id rather go back to active duty than jury dity
[2:55:02] DevilSpire: @towelliee the one time I went they dismissed the cased and didn’t live in the county so was never called back 😂😂
[2:55:07] Havoc_S1: It depends if you are grand jury or the regular jury
[2:55:17] PotbellyGoat: I saw a dude stand up and tell the court that he didn't feel right judging anyone
[2:55:20] Molvonos: 'Sir, I have AT&T and an extra chromosome, it tastes like purple in here.'
[2:55:20] PotbellyGoat: and they dismissed him lol
[2:55:22] Sollice: I got off jury duty from a murder case because I worked with the forensic tester in our DNA lab
[2:55:23] bubbles1489: the selection process where they interview you is voir dire, that is after youve been selected out of the standby pool
[2:55:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: dont try that shit in federal
[2:55:30] Sollice: He was a witness on the case. They dismissed me
[2:55:35] Zeerdan: i had a blast being on jury duty. was an attempted murder case
[2:55:40] Eshel: First case was a murder trial and I knew like 5 people on the witness list - I was excused quickly lol
[2:55:49] falldrgn: @warrenny depends on the state and their rules..
[2:55:58] hisfrankness: If it gets me out then yeah I'd say it. Stuff racks my nerves
[2:55:58] warrenny: @sollice Conflict of interest?
[2:56:02] falldrgn: I just followed the instructions on the summons
[2:56:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: i saw a woman proclaim she didn't want to be here and she would complain the whole time and judge excused her
[2:56:19] mattack10: Work in law enforcement easy out
[2:56:21] warrenny: @falldrgn different country then

[2:56:38] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[2:56:42] Sollice: @warrenny That's correct. The defense wanted me, I am sure so I could testify how the person was aa a character. Proescutor used his automatic throw out on me
[2:56:46] hisfrankness: Oh wait, law enforcement excluded??
[2:56:51] hisfrankness: No duty for me then.

[2:57:11] hisfrankness: Perfect.
[2:57:26] Sollice: You all have to be careful with your excuses
[2:57:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: i served on a jury once, a guy was a suing a hospital
[2:57:29] hisfrankness: LUL LUL LUL
[2:57:36] warrenny: Unintended biased
[2:57:36] 91Niki: I watched a lot of crime shows, does that count? Kappa
[2:57:39] abracka_: @Eshel that's some dexter mentality shit
[2:57:40] Sollice: You can actually be put in contempt of court for fucking around and making shit up
[2:57:42] Thoreya: ppl say make excuses, it aint that easy lol
[2:57:48] warrenny: @eshel Its the best option
[2:57:51] Thoreya: nah they would say fuck that lol
[2:57:51] falldrgn: be even more careful if you miss.. some places don't play
[2:57:52] kokochris: then the defence will want you in for sure
[2:58:05] Sollice: @Towelliee Yea see Towelliee thats will get you contempt lol
[2:58:09] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Towelliee honestly in your case you can just say you are self employed and being here effects your income and you will excused
[2:58:21] TheRiwen: just take a pillow with you into the court and sleep
[2:58:21] MoC_Ruthless: Just get a felony, then you wont ever get called lol
[2:58:24] Keyastaron_: bake em away toys Kappa
[2:58:25] PotbellyGoat: after you end up a jury every time you are called again they want to know what case you served on and how it was decided
[2:58:25] falldrgn: ^
[2:58:28] PotbellyGoat: which is annoying
[2:58:30] Molvonos: I told them "Yea, I'm going to fall asleep during the session.  I cant help it, i'm not narcoleptic, I just get bored and sleepy real easily".  Let me off.
[2:58:35] kokochris: you can say "I suffer from paranoia".  that will get you off
[2:58:39] homewrecker101: hes gonna say not guilty for sure- hes in
[2:58:40] Sollice: @HaxzorJimDuggan Judge: Sorry your not able to make your wages sir. This however is your civic duty
[2:58:41] Thoreya: it does not work lol
[2:58:43] Thoreya: they pay u
[2:58:45] flookguy: they dont care about your job
[2:58:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: that works everytime when i go to jury uty
[2:58:48] FalconKline: it won't, they don't care about your income
[2:58:48] flookguy: its your civic duty
[2:58:49] itsrambo: naw cuz everyone has a job
[2:58:52] Thoreya: its a federal right to do it
[2:58:59] PotbellyGoat: I got out of jury duty with a prescheduled tattoo appointment before
[2:59:00] Noshpan: I'd just tell them that my dad was into some criminal elements when I was a kid & I've never a positive experience with authority. Which, in my case, would be true.
[2:59:02] NickLeonhearth: Just go, stay quiet, wait for it to be over @Towelliee
[2:59:03] smashwow: woooo 30$ a day
[2:59:04] SonofHorus82: that does work. Cause of Financial Hardship is a reason for excuse.
[2:59:07] PotbellyGoat: that lasted for like 2 years
[2:59:08] Thoreya: u gotta partake in society once in a while
[2:59:18] ambiotic: its fun imo, good to see the system in action
[2:59:24] Eshel: When they ask you about anything - reply with a deli order and then act surprised it’s not a sandwich shop
[2:59:24] DrkPhoenix6913: i have my summons for October... i hate jury duty :(
[2:59:26] warrenny: @thoreya Screw that
[2:59:27] Sollice: @SonofHorus82 That TOTALLY depends on the jury pool and the case.
[2:59:30] Molvonos: @Thoreya Jokes on you, no I don't.  towSip
[2:59:32] SonofHorus82: If you can show that serving would adversely affect your quality of life then it can be used as an excuse.
[2:59:39] TheRavenGrave: jury duty sucks and its pay sucks
[2:59:41] PotbellyGoat: oh prepare to be disappointed for sure
[2:59:45] Eshel: @ambiotic  Same here - I actually enjoyed it
[2:59:47] PotbellyGoat: your fellow juries are going to be stupid
[2:59:47] Noshpan: I had a friend of a friend who got excused from jury duty because he wore a Marilyn Manson shirt.
[2:59:47] Lasidor: Ive always wanted to be on a jury, been summoned twice and it was dismissed both times because they reached deals.
[2:59:54] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee you think you deserve the truth?
[2:59:57] falldrgn: it doesn't take much to be excused. but you can't abuse it
[2:59:58] warrenny: Loved suits
[3:00:02] diln: "Where's Saul Goodman??"
[3:00:02] 91Niki: YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH
[3:00:07] Sollice: IM NOT OUT OF ORDER YOUR OUT OF ORDER THIS WHOLE COURT IS OUT OF ORRRDDEEERRRR
[3:00:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: show up in a wife beater
[3:00:15] itsrambo: just say you're a sovereign citizen
[3:00:25] valianya: Jury duty is 1 day waiting at courthouse to be picked, or 1 trial case.  You call in every night for 5 days to see if your number gets called.  If you're called in you wait all day in courthouse jury waiting room.  Periodically numbers are called by a trial selection and you are taken to a trial.  They start asking for anyone who needs to be excused and requires you to tell your reasons.  Then juror panel selected from remaining.  Lawyers then question each panel member  and accept or dismiss
[3:00:28] falldrgn: Did you order the code red!!
[3:00:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Juggalo thing might work, too
[3:00:32] skylaars: just got the butcher mount barding poggies
[3:00:33] Eshel: We actually decided the case the next morning by like 10oclock - but decided not to tell them until after the free lunch lol
[3:00:34] PotbellyGoat: best part of jury duty is going to lunch
[3:00:35] SmallzzIV: My brother in law is taking the bar yesterday and today... i told him to just quote "My Cousin Vinny" to anyone who talks to him and he will pass... he might fail now
[3:00:37] Sollice: @itsrambo They may put you in jail just for saying that. I would
[3:00:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: DID YOU ORDER THE CODE RED
[3:00:41] Noshpan: I guess they don't want a juror whose best dressed is a shirt that says "I am the god of fuck"
[3:00:47] Keyastaron_: my dad got out of jury duty and tell them if they were gonna pay him his hourly pay of 20$ an hour being at the court house Kappa
[3:00:52] CaptnPawPaws: Just go wearing an Austin 3:16 shirt, and they'll send you on your way
[3:00:54] Sollice: It should yes
[3:00:56] Lasidor: Yes
[3:00:56] Sollice: No
[3:00:58] Sollice: No
[3:01:06] Sollice: They may tell you that your excused for that day
[3:01:10] xp0otietangx: i think you call 1 time a week
[3:01:13] falldrgn: @valianya is it 5 days? I think that depends on what your county\state rules are
[3:01:16] Keyastaron_: you go to jail if you dont go to jury duty
[3:01:17] Derca_: it will say when to check again if your number isn't called the first day
[3:01:17] Sollice: or they may say you have to continue calling
[3:01:21] Keyastaron_: ?
[3:01:22] Lasidor: Thats how it worked for me, I went in, they dismissed and I was told I was good for a year.
[3:01:26] ackdogg007: just start talking about the two yutes
[3:01:30] emeraldhook: Funny story, I actually got to see Jack Nickelson at the picket lines two weeks ago at Netflix studios. Was cool.
[3:01:33] Molvonos: Just make that noise I made a soundbyte out of.
[3:01:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: eventually it says you are fully released and to stop calling
[3:01:34] Eshel: Where I was from - if you wore a short like that to a courtroom - you’ll likely get a contempt charge
[3:01:38] Molvonos: That'll let you go
[3:01:44] im_n0t_jezus: dont get bribed
[3:01:46] hisfrankness: I'm not even the one going and my heart is nervous. Lmao.

[3:02:33] Arnzuil: idk but it might get you off lol
[3:02:38] Divine_Miscreant: That shirt got my brother in law an unpaid day off
[3:02:39] Sollice: You may have something going there
[3:02:40] CoolioDoom: I did jury duty a good few years ago, 2 weeks and last week I finally got called in. But I think if never done before it's worth the experence imo.
[3:02:46] Effin_Steffin: that'll get you escorted out and a one way ticket to jail
[3:02:47] falldrgn: if you are concerned just call the clerk of court
[3:02:47] Eshel: Towelliee live-streaming from the jury box ftw

[3:02:56] warrenny: @sollice Might get you arrested
[3:03:04] Sollice: @warrenny Lot of mights :P
[3:03:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: judges do what they want in their court room
[3:03:24] Sollice: Because it's obviously an attempt to piss off the court to not get picked and that's contempt
[3:03:25] Derca_: business casual
[3:03:28] Keyastaron_: no shorts
[3:03:28] PadidinJones: Put on a tux
[3:03:30] Deadelus0: You live in america? How can you ask for logic?
[3:03:31] sirtoasted: If yiur trying to get out of jury duty all you have to say is your bias to the case or you can tell them your a lil racist lol both work as a good excuse

[3:11:48] valianya: @towelliee   if the trial is expected to last a while you absolutely can get out of it because of lost income due to being self employed and loss of income because no employer paying wages, because state wage coverage for jury duty is miniscule compared to actual wages.  You can also be excused if you have prescheduled nonrefundable trip, or fundamentally disagree with something about defendant.  Someone got out of dog trial by claiming they hate dogs.

[3:30:21] disflux: Blizzard's Network Engineers have gone way downhill. There was a tweet a few days ago about how in D4 your client downloads every player's full inventory + their stash when in proximity, which is why they can't do infinite bags.
[3:30:22] 91Niki: @gfield2k he's prob gonna swap back as soon as servers are back up
[3:30:29] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: What class are you going to play whenever hardcore comes out?

[3:34:25] Wulfgrym: @91Niki is this hardcore classic?
[3:34:32] gfield2k: I went rend fury my first go round with barb. But to me it falls off hard the higher you go. Because mobs have so much HP. An the bleed has less effect
[3:34:51] 91Niki: @Wulfgrym No... this is PATRICK
[3:35:09] Wulfgrym: @91Niki KEKW
[3:35:18] Armdel: are you sure you don't have blessings...? you unlock the first one early in the battle pass and only need lvl 40 on one seasonal char
[3:35:55] Noshpan: LUL
[3:36:03] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee you have to go back and claim them
[3:36:04] Armdel: you have to manually claim them
[3:36:06] Mushythegoblin: did you collect it??
[3:36:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: because you are level 7
[3:36:10] Gungre: You need to collect it after yo hit the level
[3:36:27] idholypoo: you had one more season reward to claim
[3:36:45] Molvonos: The percentages stack weird, too
[3:36:55] Molvonos: At rank 4, you only get 8% additional XP
[3:37:04] 91Niki: Sir Streamer, I have observed with my eyes that you are playing Diablo 4. I also observed that you are still under the World of Warcraft category. This is unacceptable!

[3:41:07] cta62: @Davedaman26 nice lets go dude
[3:41:17] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee apparently, when we encounter other players, we load the player and their stash thus too many stash tabs would cause stability issues.

[3:56:05] DoryuKa: @91Niki Thanks
[3:56:42] Wulfgrym: ill definitely play the last season when it launches for d3, one final go at d3
[3:56:52] Turco11: omg i spent 70 bucks on D4 and only got 100 hours of gameplay

[4:14:02] Exodeo_: 20k hps!
[4:14:15] Molvonos: Did he turn off his UI?
[4:14:29] flookguy: D4 season 1 is real bad they are working to fix it i think

[4:19:00] RandomWeirdo_: He's just use to a bear tank
[4:19:10] Tbagt: Anyone else who thinks d4 just got boring to early
[4:19:21] iamspacemanspiff: guess its healers that are short now not tanks so much
[4:19:37] dundunnorway: pala dps buff noticeable?
[4:19:45] krispurrstv: what servers are you playing on? weird maintenance times rn.
[4:19:47] souljazz: This holy priest is 2357 IO score. carried?
[4:19:50] Eshel: @iamspacemanspiff  Healers are definitely lacking
[4:20:10] NickLeonhearth: Life is hard healing a 448 prot pala
[4:20:13] NickLeonhearth: paper tank
[4:20:18] LuiBMHunter: holy priest is mostly reactive heals I think - until you take damage all they have is renew ?
[4:20:19] dirtydeus: 2356 io doesn’t mean much
[4:20:34] Reubensandvich: Noob question, does over healing still cause additional aggro?
[4:21:17] xAcidElfx: GOT MY MERCH IN THE MAIL! LOVE IT BRO!
[4:21:22] LuiBMHunter: not like it did it in classic - tanks rarely lose aggro these days
[4:21:25] Exodeo_: I mean, the shadowpriest is pumping on healing done
[4:21:26] xAcidElfx: caps whoops
[4:21:41] Polen: @LuiBMHunter is more about light weaving
[4:21:45] thedamndudedevin: If this is the level of healing needed for a 17 then I am ready lol
[4:22:04] Polen: but reactive healing is a normal thing for all healers in m+
[4:22:12] Polen: since you just DPS until people take dmg
[4:22:14] nocturnal_2195: @Reubensandvich No tanks pull so much aggro nowadays that healing does not really effect aggro
[4:22:29] Reubensandvich: @insanity2195 Thanks
[4:22:29] AlphasaurusRexx: @thedamndudedevin even easier with an augvoker XD
[4:22:36] LuiBMHunter: true I would not expect to see a healer any level having 0 damage done
[4:22:43] nocturnal_2195: @Reubensandvich np
[4:22:46] Reubensandvich: @insanity2195 I haven't played end game since 2009.. so my knowledge is outdated.
[4:23:16] Snabido: Is hunters pet sposed to spaz out like that
[4:23:25] nocturnal_2195: @Reubensandvich Yeah stuff has changed alot since then
[4:23:34] thedamndudedevin: I am LOVING aug envokers. always looking for one to get into the group @AlphasaurusRexx
[4:23:43] Exodeo_: I see dead people xD
[4:24:06] ragingmel: the pet AI is so trash
[4:24:08] AlphasaurusRexx: @thedamndudedevin it trivializes all m+ timers now
[4:24:12] Molvonos: @Towelliee Degen-Elly has been summoned, and will be able to make your pants when she gets online.
[4:24:13] ragingmel: @Snabido
[4:24:29] nocturnal_2195: @Reubensandvich However if a dps is really pumping dmg he could probably pull aggro off the tank
[4:24:56] Eshel: Healer gets loot - why am I not surprised
[4:25:26] Snabido: PI weak auras would've solved this run KEKW
[4:25:29] Eshel: Blacklist that healer imo
[4:25:43] flookguy: always like that on illidan in the morning for me

[4:28:52] AlphasaurusRexx: dream of cenarius is disgusting
[4:29:07] zippit420: tank topping meters? Kappa
[4:29:41] AlphasaurusRexx: @bambooooh i was jjust recommending that because their player pool is probably the lowest. i like playing low populated specs
[4:29:46] stepdrag: new sub badge. lets go
[4:29:49] abracka_: lol i forgot someone changed your details name to twitter x KEKW
[4:29:51] AlphasaurusRexx: yeah it crits for 500k and then hots a bit after
[4:30:10] mavericks312: Most lfr players are afk or just spamming instants lol
[4:30:25] Elizare: @Towelliee what kind of pants you need?
[4:30:49] bambooooh: @alphasaurusrexx aye, I went with BM due to the stagger mechanic and the pretty solid self heal, so you still juggle shield block and ignore pain or?
[4:30:51] valianya: Zero Hunters in raid, I wanted to see how they compared now
[4:30:53] abracka_: sign that mage to liquid
[4:30:56] Exodeo_: LUL
[4:30:57] ragingmel: hunter can do it with feign lol
[4:31:07] mavericks312: I mean mages are the best players so
[4:31:22] ragingmel: hunter is one of those hard classes to actually play properly
[4:31:33] LuiBMHunter: thought about queing for sark on my voker on eu earlier - 65 minute wait time
[4:31:42] AlphasaurusRexx: @bambooooh no idea i havent played prot war since end of slands. my guess is yes though. you wont have as much sef healing though
[4:31:47] ragingmel: everyone messes up the pets and utility
[4:32:33] falldrgn: This hearing is crazy
[4:32:36] ragingmel: its a debuff that requires a lot of healing while you are stunned
[4:32:44] LuiBMHunter: fairly sure you die - could be wrong tho
[4:32:47] bambooooh: @alphasaurusrexx Ye, I guess you can still utilize last stand and victory rush etc. might give it a shot, otherwise bear seems pretty safe even after the nerf
[4:33:18] Eshel: Think it goes away at phase change in LFR - but not sure only ran LFR twice - guess we’re about to find out lol
[4:33:48] theANGRYcasual: Just wanted to say ty for the Blackhole giveaway. The items showed yesterday.
[4:33:51] herzlustafir: pling
[4:34:13] AlphasaurusRexx: @bambooooh bear is still insane. their nerf to usrol doesnt feel like much until you start getting into the bigger pulls. even then with dream of cenarious, wildfire, and ursol youre still doing really good self healing.
[4:34:47] Daarksyde: Twitter X topping dmg

[5:02:49] AlphasaurusRexx: le sigh. TLDR AMS to trivialize entangle. you can either precast or cast at end of entangle and itll do the same thing. DA only removes the movement slow
[5:03:36] Exodeo_: These 2 weren't doing any mechanics at all lol, i'm working healer overhours at 441 ilvl
[5:03:47] WundertueteGER: yes

[5:04:00] Heero_Effect: Stream both
[5:04:21] kajun_predator: tbh tho, tanking is progressively getting easier since Legion. Actual tanking required a brain during the Cata/MoP days.
[5:04:22] Heero_Effect: Fair
[5:04:31] UtiAlex: 😂 I go where the bag takes me
[5:04:46] fizzalf: whats happening on friday @Towelliee ?

[5:06:58] kajun_predator: i disagree, the reason tanking is easier now, is because the game itself is easier. less buttons and what not.
[5:07:04] ackdogg007: Id be happy if they can just fix the stability of the game
[5:07:49] kajun_predator: nah bro prot paladin had like at least 10 buttons

[5:08:24] AlphasaurusRexx: if you take the same player caliber now and put them in cata dungeons. the difficulty of tanking will not increase
[5:08:33] Snabido: autoattack doesnt count as an ability fyi Keepo

[6:01:57] Mushythegoblin: how many hours till lvl 10?
[6:02:02] gingerbasterd: @Affiiance ooo do you have any articles about it? I love reading about it
[6:02:22] 91Niki: @Affiiance My guess is; it's something that would crumple out social structure aka the knowledge of our past, human history and religion. Or they just don't wanna piss off the aliens friends that they keep it captive :p
[6:02:35] Affiiance: Yes
[6:02:41] Eshel: @abracka_  He testified about possession of “non-human transport” and “non earth biological bodies” / “dead pilots”

[7:39:33] AtomicScrotus: @boopyloopey Get into a helpful guild.. community is great
[7:39:37] abracka_: when it first launched it was a absolute shit show
[7:39:43] Sollice: You wont get a LOTR remaster, they are making another one
[7:39:49] abracka_: so many quests were bugged to shit
[7:40:03] boopyloopey: perfect! ive always wanted to give it a go
[7:40:03] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[7:40:08] boopyloopey: @atomicscrotus thankyou
[7:40:42] JustSeren1ty: @Sollice not a full remaster, but they are doing a huge update about a whole lot .
[7:41:18] Sollice: @JustSeren1ty Meh. May be good for the game in a short term but they wont have two lotr online games going at the same time so it will eventually be turned down
[7:41:29] JustSeren1ty: @Towelliee do u have a addon list for Eso? i like ur Ui and stuff
[7:41:37] kingdaddy96: It used to be that you couldn't complete the main story unless you go on in the middle of the night and got lucky. Because people would sit and spam block bosses from spawning
[7:41:53] AtomicScrotus: @boopyloopey its worth every minute...me and the wife both love the lore behind it
[7:42:09] ambiotic: post your hits!
[7:42:18] Sollice: WoW prime loot
[7:42:20] Sollice: tomorrow
[7:42:49] JustSeren1ty: @Sollice The original Lotro will not go down. Look how many years its going. Even when the new one comes out ppl will go back to it. Look at WoW Classic for example
[7:42:59] abracka_: hard praying for TCG tabard

[7:43:47] Sollice: @JustSeren1ty I mean from an IP standpoint. They have to be granted a continued license. The old dev company may lose it
