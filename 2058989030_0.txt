[5:17:48] Deadge_Gartic: for 60
[5:17:54] Deadge_Gartic: and probably dual spec too LULW
[5:18:05] misomander: wat aura
[5:18:07] Kleik__: @Deadge_Gartic they will probably have pvp event with epic mount juh
[5:18:18] Deadge_Gartic: @Kleik_bor maybe
[5:18:28] MaDookieDook: Permission to sit, sir?
[5:18:34] rickksen: where is that rune from?
[5:18:35] Deadge_Gartic: @Kleik_bor but their current decisions kinda shows that they believe everyone has around 500g atm om
[5:18:43] rickksen: we could do a macro no?
[5:18:48] rickksen: aah
[5:18:53] poopooindiaper: @Savix awesome stream today. This area gives me a deja poo kind of feeling.
[5:18:56] Kleik__: @Deadge_Gartic yea they are idiots LULW fuego have 50g and i have 120g LULW
[5:18:56] Azkafan: @Savix priests cant make dispersion cancelaura work ( few can others dont )
[5:19:03] Turbopumper: is it a buff?
[5:19:03] tronbadgames: try divine plea
[5:19:04] Azkafan: i think cancelaura overall is problematic atm
[5:19:06] esbi__: Someone will prob come up with macro that works
