[3:22:29] rykhann: @DenaliDude yes, because the competition is also variable - in MDI the only variable is player side so there is no level of randomness to contend with
[3:22:29] Kahlandra: you can't compare a moba to an mmo
[3:22:36] GenmaichaLife: True, but WoW has tons of specs to choose from
[3:22:37] Stragic: easy fix - add a chain lightning affix
[3:22:39] dabudoesgames: pretty sure at worlds you say the same 10 or so champs picked every game
[3:22:50] ShadyWizWolf: uh huh
[3:22:50] BabyninjaJesuz: @Kahlandra until you start looking at competitive heroes to non competitive heroes and realize league has an insanely small competitive pool
[3:22:51] GenmaichaLife: and a lot more ability to be creative with the different things these specs provide
[3:23:08] rykhann: it will literally never occur that all 36 or 37 or whatever specs are played in equal measure in MDI, and it would be awful if it did
[3:23:15] GenmaichaLife: nah, you see some of the same pics, but not all of them are the same
[3:23:18] Kahlandra: so then its the same as wow, on a larger scale, there are viable and nonviable options

[3:23:36] FearEngine: @corexdk yeah but it would be nice if they rotated occasionally
[3:23:39] BabyninjaJesuz: @Kahlandra yep, its just as badly balanced as wow, thats correct, thats teh complaint
[3:23:44] oldwetsock: they could always make it so you can't play the same spec in consecutive maps
[3:23:57] Drezitu: @Aria_Av old talents? LUL
[3:24:01] vanqxo: @DenaliDude theres no bans so why would you handicap yourself
[3:24:14] rykhann: @Aria_Av lol yeah sure people would "flex" three whole talent point MAYBE
[3:24:32] JohneKarate24: @andrealuvs there is a staff from raid that procs a heal i believe
[3:24:42] ZagFan590: Imagine using MDI as a barometer for class balance when the MDI is basically a speed run.
[3:24:51] ShadyWizWolf: Ban what? LUL @DenaliDude
[3:25:14] GenmaichaLife: Because when peopel see everything that is played in MDI is rogue/WW/DK/prot warr/Rdruid then it hurts live and people think those are the only classes that are viable to do keys with
[3:25:18] BabyninjaJesuz: what other measurement is there when your running dungeons? transmog?
[3:25:25] andrealuvs: @johnekarate24 oh ty
[3:25:28] Innkkeeper: just make it so you cant have more than 2 of the same class?

[3:28:01] igmatats: Why does no one complain about class balance in classic?
[3:28:02] rykhann: @FearEngine i'd say most people who watch competition level of ANYTHING would rather see the absolute cutting edge compete against each other
[3:28:08] FearEngine: @corexdk the fact that you think skill level has anything to do with making the show entertaining says a lot lol

[3:28:21] rykhann: @FearEngine otherwise you'd see stupid garbage like football teams being forced to play without goalkeepers
[3:28:27] Innkkeeper: classic already happened and that was the way it was

[3:29:07] ShadyWizWolf: Source plz? @lee098
[3:29:17] BabyninjaJesuz: @igmatats because you can kill the first raid with players at lv 56, balance doesnt matter when all the content is easy and horribly balanced
[3:29:32] ShadyWizWolf: People complain bout everything LUL
[3:29:35] rekinngames: Classic is for people that aren't good enough to play retail Kappa

[3:29:42] ElfDestruct: @igmatats because everyone's already busy complaining about how classic is nerfed due to being 1.12

[6:46:51] Buddha_boy_: zz
[6:46:53] nixxy_7: @yoshie1301 you can see that very much in some special bosses like the boss in legion with the orbs one in mythic if 1 player misstimes the orbs white and green ones or accidently colides with another when they swap the raid is a wipe
[6:46:58] Thdlock: ye guys high M+ is really hard it scales infinite so that makes it harder tahn raiding LUL
[6:47:00] AU_Elii: @PandaFan686 that is good to hear, they deserve it

[6:47:42] SupremeQAQ: @Thdlock wanna do ZF GY?
[6:47:47] AU_Elii: @nixied71 again depends on the boss and mechanics, not many bosses have mechanics like that, not ones that will instnatly wipe raids, you have ones that will make it harder but not completely wipe them
[6:48:18] nixxy_7: thats what i said some bosses in raids are way harder then M+ dungeons thats what i was saying above but at some bosses not all
[6:48:19] satelitko88: @kekepops Yes, yes. That must indeed be it. I mean, you're obviously the expert on that topic.
