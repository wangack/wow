[6:47:27] SpectralSkull: Tooltip for vesper tells you how it works, it procs off spells I think.
[6:48:17] babayaro____: which version of wow is this? @Swifty
[6:48:25] Yikitiz: 3 offensive spells and 3 healing spells
[6:48:36] SpectralSkull: Some people cost it off target to charge it and move it in for last hit it they have the soulbind for big last damage
[6:49:11] babayaro____: what do you guys recommendend for beginners in wow? there are too many skills... how can I handle this easy?
[6:49:24] SpectralSkull: You can move the totem around as much as you want while its up
[6:49:25] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[6:49:47] K_Kikonga: @ozzi1_ Honest opinion, play a Beast Mastery Hunter. Super easy and basic
[6:49:58] bigb0ngrip: @ozzi1_ this is retail wow, and I recommend frost mage SeemsGood
