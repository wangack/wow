[2:36:30] Sollice: @jarilrpg They can be raid theme. That's fine and they really should be raid themed. But I think S1 was overall was not successful from an armor standpoint
[2:36:34] Crunks_Lever: I really hope that when they do the world revamp with graphical update they update armor graphics from old stuff.
[2:37:00] Sollice: @Crunks_Lever Ehh I wouldn't count on it

[4:07:32] Curleaf: These are all the mad people on our Horde side I'll bet
[4:07:38] NMosier85: the point of SoD is to have fun, why everyone gotta be so negative, just let us old people  play
[4:07:46] Shurn_82: @falldrgn exactly, they are just looking for the acidic feelign in their body...its actually addictive to some children

[4:08:08] SpidercowSD: Gnomer is next Raid
[4:08:08] Asuo_: I assume the runes will go onto new gear that goes in that range right? Helms become more wide spread in the 30s so put runes there right?

[4:08:48] Gibsonex937: hope they fix the fyrakk bugs today.
[4:08:52] Mckhero: ye especially with the level increase from 1-25 after new season

[7:38:54] Nerendis: Follower dungeons are pretty pepega IMO. But maybe I'm wrong
[7:38:56] brazkat: follower dungeons arent gonna be that lit unless your new but even then routes will only be able to be done if its a current dungeon for season
[7:38:59] Phoxzy: The only time I use follower dungeons in FF14 is when Im borred. I dont expect it to be any different in wow.
[7:39:06] pbnj_kills: only gonna be good for practicing on anything other than a training dummy
[7:39:07] yaaboibluee: follower dungeons are only 60-70 right

[7:39:56] yaaboibluee: i hope they open it up from 1-70
[7:39:56] jaytitan96: As a LW i'll use follower dungeons to go make Decay Recipes
[7:39:56] ascendence94: @Towelliee im thinking the only good use of followers dugs is if u like the lore and want to go back and see the story in the dugeon cuz i know it's harder to do that in a actaul group when everyone just wants to finish the dugeon quick
[7:40:03] rsimpson105: OMEGALUL

[7:41:50] Ithylz: It's also a story mode, notably for lvling when you need to do a dungeon for quests etc
[7:41:55] ThornRavencroft: I'm looking forward to follower dungeons as I like the idea of being able to do a practice run or two on healing toons I haven't played in ages.

[7:43:32] hammack52: that limit just sounds stupid
[7:43:33] shapebender: so for peole like me who's ilvl that is 397 and have not played in 6 months due to work ... follower dung would help me then
[7:43:37] Rysilk: @Ultratide_ You would be surprised
[7:43:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Delves, more scenarios, a few things could use really good AI companions
