[0:57:13] misstherese: clip I dunno who I do it
[0:57:15] Sinostra: it's just that you use only 1/10th of your resist
[0:57:32] Sinostra: 6
[0:57:34] Sinostra: 18 sec

[1:00:48] Sinostra: both can happen
[1:01:08] notgarru: just check if its impacted by haunt no?
[1:01:12] misstherese: what you should do is make the dot counts and then mark the statistics like 1000 dot then se it better
[1:01:14] notgarru: easiest way to test if its a dot
[1:01:24] Sinostra: i got both
[1:01:30] Sinostra: partial AND full resist
[1:01:33] tpleym: fear
[1:01:53] misstherese: but the dot count important
[1:01:58] Sinostra: so do you want a binary spell ?

[4:27:12] flenbober: or something
[4:27:25] Omgezzz: i main priest but made a mage also while wait for phase 2
[4:27:52] wolfaloned: During maintenance on February 6, we will purge any that are already in players‚Äô mailboxes. We suggest that any players who have any Marks in your mailbox, retrieve them and use them before the end of Phase 1, or they will be lost.
[4:27:57] wolfaloned: rip mark stacking :D
[4:28:03] flenbober: is drain life a cd?
[4:28:05] Kiroxx: so 10 shadowres to resist 80% fear? and 45 to avoid plaque? got it :D
[4:28:13] thenotsomissinglink: can just outrange drain life though
[4:29:01] Kiroxx: yes farming after 10pm on 7th will grant u marks - from that wording at least.
[4:29:15] Kiroxx: cuz 24h in mail
[4:30:20] wolfaloned: ye but when the p2 coming is the question what time

[4:30:29] Kiroxx: 10pm on 8th,
[4:30:33] fiskensfriend: he prob shouldnt even play with living flame as fire. With out imp Fb slow and u having WB to outrun he is better of finishing with arcane surge or pumping dmg with icey veins

[4:38:43] fiskensfriend: u were moving when the cs landed
[4:39:13] luzid7: i think mage counters priest but getting destroyed by all other classes except warr
[4:40:22] fiskensfriend: @luzid7 maybe fire spec idk but dont think frost has lethal the same way fire does vs priest
[4:41:43] Shepp22: close
[4:41:49] fiskensfriend: i feel like if he holds his CS everytime instead of trying to cs he wins more often
[4:42:54] upperpizzapie90: jesus
[4:43:37] Sinostra: Hey Hydra, I finally got my soul leech pants
[4:43:45] Sinostra: just the staff left now

[4:49:28] konexi: nice thanks

[5:49:45] Sinostra: when's the next ashenvale ?
[5:49:47] Chazzmichael: How is the tier list looking?
[5:52:16] Sinostra: can you go to the barrens on eu ?
[5:52:27] Sinostra: i promise i won't resist as much
[5:53:43] DuduIsFTeam: Its really hard to beat a good warlock
[5:53:52] DuduIsFTeam: If he was try harding he could'v bombed ur homies
[5:54:01] DuduIsFTeam: then force the shit out of u with incinerates
[5:54:08] DuduIsFTeam: would'v been even easier for him
[5:54:43] DuduIsFTeam: but for priests its hard not having the space to run and range some of his casts
[5:54:54] DuduIsFTeam: duels are one thing Wpvp its another
[5:55:30] DuduIsFTeam: I agree
[5:55:35] DuduIsFTeam: and u outrange the fear too
[5:55:47] DuduIsFTeam: but if u'r dueling u dont have that space
[5:56:02] Sinostra: both drain and fear are only 20y range
[5:56:18] DuduIsFTeam: I would say its nearly impossible to beat a good warlock with even gear in a duel like this
[5:56:29] DuduIsFTeam: this dude is slacking he could be using succ and kiling homies first
[5:56:39] DuduIsFTeam: then just putting unreal preassure with incinerates
[5:58:03] Exasol: shadow protection pot is only reliable way against aff lock if you cant range or dispel. Stops the drain healing completely so you can actually race them down
[5:58:25] eddiemeduza13: can ele beat priest p1?
[5:59:17] Weddzz: Got a guild duel tournament coming up - feel prepared against everything except enhancement.. What's the win condition? Kill totems etc but I can't seem to outlast them
[6:00:21] imdenissthegreat: you using homies ar 25% health purposely or forgetting ?
[6:00:32] DuduIsFTeam: One thing the warlock can do as well is target dummy the homies, but that's the same scenario as Shadow pot, really try hard stuff lmao
[6:01:51] Weddzz: Yeah most ppl have shadow protection from trinket now
[6:02:10] Viwia: is it pure lazyness or why dont you have Engi already? :P
[6:02:17] thesilverlx: Where are good ol' arenas pal ? I miss it
[6:02:22] thesilverlx: Hi !
[6:02:29] DuduIsFTeam: Yeah, fair, it goes on tourney rules pretty much
[6:02:46] justingatlin: @Hydramist did you try out twisted faith and shadow word + mindshear spec ? its good burst
[6:03:24] buttonzking: wait are drops enabled on this streams?
[6:03:29] lyrie77: why is this guy using vw agains priest lol
[6:03:50] Sinostra: @lyrie77 what else do you want us to use ?
[6:04:16] lyrie77: succ, because priest can dispel vw shield
[6:04:24] TrebekTv: Isn't succ dam decent?
[6:04:25] Sinostra: can you go to the bridge ?
[6:04:32] Sinostra: between barrens and duuro

[6:11:38] Domsterr95: What ever happened to Tankz?
[6:11:41] lunnebror: 1v1 do a good priest lose to any class right now?
[6:12:12] thecornmaster: but can you lose to rets
[6:12:25] Crawfordlol: damn Tankz the warrior zugging BGs
[6:12:28] GamerGierr: You can lose to tryhard druids ;-)
[6:13:12] GamerGierr: equally skilled, no priest should win.
[6:13:17] h0nnda: what about hunters?
[6:13:29] varaipad: next phase , rogue bis pvp combat or sub?
[6:13:36] not_gatti: water shield sham is only hard counter to priest
[6:13:56] HelluvaWrecks: priest should lose to any class that doesnt have an interupt
[6:14:00] HelluvaWrecks: shouldnt
[6:14:24] Shepp22: cat sunfire spec would be hard
[6:14:26] bambucha34: mage is oom simulator
[6:14:27] GamerGierr: There is a lot of druids there that don't seem to know where that dispel button is
[6:14:29] Shepp22: difficult even
[6:14:35] leerooy111: should of repaired
[6:14:49] swagorac: what was the thing about warlock using rank 1 corruption? you were talking about it earlier but I was just tuning in

[6:15:25] Shepp22: sunfire, Lifebloom, survival of the fitest Druid that stays at Max range
[6:15:34] swagorac: does dispell always take off the last spell or is it random?
[6:15:47] GamerGierr: lifebloom costs too much mana
[6:15:56] GamerGierr: If you were gonna use it, you'd have to be in melee using clearcasting
[6:16:04] GamerGierr: but even then, it never procs
[6:16:51] swagorac: does dispell always take off the last applied spell or is it random and the corruption just increases the chance your dispel will hit something worse than dl or haunt
[6:17:27] swagorac: okay makes sense
[6:17:29] GamerGierr: Feel like it's always dispelling lifebloom though lmao
[6:17:40] Sinostra: how much mana does dispel cost ?
[6:17:40] GamerGierr: or WG
[6:18:04] GamerGierr: half mana back
[6:18:42] GamerGierr: The best thing I can say to do is to reapply a rank 1 mark
