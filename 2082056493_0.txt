[1:38:05] MochiMurloc: What is this catDance keking
[1:38:15] MochiMurloc: catDance JotaroPhoto
[1:38:16] Deadge_Gartic: @KaizeeRx basically demon hunter class design tbh
[1:38:20] Nuh_EFT: catDance
[1:38:21] Deadge_Gartic: and its what it should be
[1:38:31] bodyshotandy19: must suck at the game or something
[1:38:39] CamGG__: @A1K_GAMING mr @Savix your thoughts on Gnomer Axe? Ret or War?
[1:38:40] MochiMurloc: catDance ohh, shiiit
[1:38:43] httpfarmersonly: I like how FFXIV does it and just upgrades current abilities to give new VFX and passives
[1:38:47] KaizeeRx: @Deadge_Gartic thats how i feel about fury war simple to play but feels fun to play suh
[1:38:48] aatsulan: catDance
[1:38:49] KaizeeRx: in retail
[1:38:53] Jajabol: lost ark 8button is perfect
[1:38:59] Deadge_Gartic: @KaizeeRx fury is doomed man lots of garbage in talent tree
[1:39:01] Deadge_Gartic: needs revamp
[1:39:03] speedypope: GW2 is a good example of how a few buttons can make a good game
[1:39:10] ButtobiBoop: ffxiv is super bloated
[1:39:13] Laawkey: i still dont know what im clicking in ff muh
[1:39:25] Sardaco: TRUE! League has 4 buttons and millions of people play it.
[1:39:25] ButtobiBoop: I hope they remove 1 2 3 combo
[1:39:28] httpfarmersonly: oh no ffxiv playstyle no, but the abilities upgraded yes
[1:39:33] JariMurhapuro: i agree
[1:39:35] MankrikWife: greetings, lovely genetlemen
[1:39:39] ButtobiBoop: there are addons that remove the 1 2 3 which is nice
[1:39:43] Rugmouse: combat in lost ark is goated
[1:39:55] Nuallan94: classes with lots of buttons feel great in retail, like arcane mage n shit
[1:39:56] Mythirun: it was too much homework and p2w
[1:39:59] hoppo0815: lost arks combat/classes are just the best yeah, but anything else is pure pain Sadge
[1:40:33] Deadge_Gartic: current retail is ok
[1:40:34] MochiMurloc: @MankrikWife hello
[1:40:42] Deadge_Gartic: they kinda gutted a lot since shadowlands
[1:40:58] Deadge_Gartic: but still probably most fun i had with classes was legion
[1:41:06] Deadge_Gartic: being op feels good too
[1:41:30] tha_wicked: mythic+ was new as well
[1:41:30] aaron_grim: legion and wod were some of my faves for arena
[1:41:30] Deadge_Gartic: i think legion is modern wows problem
[1:41:31] hoppo0815: i hope there is kinda a reset after the world saga in retail
[1:41:32] Deadge_Gartic: they cant top it
[1:41:38] DankDaddyFlex: i think leaning towards more customization in retail is the move
[1:41:44] babawes: legion was the most bloated but still fun
[1:41:46] fausqt: cataclysm PvP was fun.
[1:41:57] KaizeeRx: legion to bfa was probably the worst it felt for class power in wows history suh
[1:42:05] SwampKrunk: SwampKrunk subscribed with Prime. 
[1:42:08] KaizeeRx: i wanted to off myself in bfa palying with the dogshit azerite armor suh
[1:42:12] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix if legion was wow 2.0 they probably need 3.0 like legion level revamp
[1:42:13] Traitmark: juh
[1:42:19] Deadge_Gartic: might be the only fix
[1:42:25] Deadge_Gartic: @KaizeeRx 116 to 117 Despairge
[1:42:28] Deadge_Gartic: you lose all your power
[1:42:30] Deadge_Gartic: with 1 level up
[1:42:36] listrel1: I think MoP to WoD was the worst LULW They pruned all your abilities
[1:42:43] fausqt: legion pretty much no content.
[1:42:47] Laawkey: i actually liked corruption and necklace it was just badly balanced
[1:42:50] Mythirun: the transition from legion to bfa power was so shit

[2:03:59] Erronhatheos: TBCs a feeling :)

[2:06:39] SodaBannedMe: TBC classic felt so much worse for some reason. people living in dungeons, bots zooming to herbs.
[2:06:39] Jaspxxx: TBC is better because of pvp

[2:11:08] Colddaylight: There is no harm in keeping a Classic server up, TBC etc etc
[2:11:08] greywind317: Add new story after endgame of SOD
[2:11:08] Aldendir: non, give me riot mmo
[2:11:09] bib0u_1: hc sod tbc/wrath
[2:11:14] Deadge_Gartic: @Laawkey for 20 years btw om
[2:11:15] jtstroud: @Laawkey change bad me scared of change
[2:11:15] Dacoolface: I want SoD to continue untill 60 and then enter Classic+ mode. All new shit, but at lvl 60.
[2:11:18] Bundif: Yeah I think SOD breathed new life into the old wow
[2:11:19] casualfriendly: Don't diverse the playerbase even more. Go more with classic+ after SoD would be nice, but dont bother the expansions
[2:11:20] Parcelazo: @Laawkey nostalgia is a hell of a drug
[2:11:22] Sxnv: we need new mmo
[2:11:28] d0gula: classic sod with tbc races
[2:11:30] replay2315: @Savix classic with new dungeons/raids
[2:11:31] gamewatcher024: Like the game is so progressive that it's okay to go back and replay it again because all we do is race to the end
[2:11:31] TheVaroon: Good idea, bad execution imo
[2:11:36] Deadge_Gartic: @Laawkey literally last 20 years they wake up raid molten core and sleep then repeat LULW
[2:11:37] Kira_Corpse: sprinkle on top ofc
[2:11:41] justBenFFS: dragonflight sod fuh
[2:11:42] twinket_56: twinket_56 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! sup man
[2:11:42] Turbonerd_TV: @Savix just without the flying. never bring that to sod
[2:11:43] Laawkey: @Deadge_Gartic deadass
[2:11:45] Sxnv: @Dacoolface yeah this would be best case scenario imo
[2:11:47] TecPriest: i dont like the idea of my progress resetting every season
[2:11:48] causemosmvp: TBC was so boring
[2:11:49] KebabAgon: @Savix I would 100% prefer old vanilla, no changes, no nothing, over sod or era. The whole point of classic was to play the game as it was lol
[2:11:51] SodaBannedMe: Savix, what would you choose first. A retail expac with everything you want or a SOD tbc version I feel like people forget about retail all the time now
[2:11:54] Deadge_Gartic: tbc is attunement sim
[2:11:56] itsBdaws: tbc phase 1 was THE SHIT
[2:11:57] geennaamnl1: I loved TBC more than wrath
[2:11:58] gypsydangar: hey whats up hansol!
[2:12:04] A_RCHR: tbc was fun before all the nerfs
[2:12:12] TheVaroon: not 6 months
[2:12:12] SanMuki: TBC was better than wrath 100%
[2:12:13] TheVaroon: 2 years
[2:12:13] replay2315: @Savix classic with new dungeons/raids 󠀀
[2:12:14] Colddaylight: Wrath was hype cause we were going to kill the Lich King..
[2:12:14] Bundif: I actually expected to play a TON of TBC but i insta quit as soon as i hit 70
[2:12:15] jamespatunia: classic andy make me sick
[2:12:16] KebabAgon: 2 years
[2:12:22] gamewatcher024: I think I've seen so many new characters started in this vanilla beginning that it's essentially become boring
[2:12:25] Dacoolface: Classic is still around, SoD isnt Classic.
[2:12:26] Deadge_Gartic: bro you guys coping
[2:12:29] Jambudi: tbc raiding was nice, except for Hyjal, we don't talk about this.
[2:12:30] Deadge_Gartic: retail is popping off
[2:12:32] swarlos1: tbc was boring for me, i prefer sod only in vanilla
[2:12:36] misomander: retail is great lol
[2:12:38] _의문의사나이: hello
[2:12:38] Sxnv: Kappa
[2:12:42] baerenkrieger: classic without a wannabee elitism community, that woul be a good start :P
[2:12:44] Ragi_Fz: I feel like retail is super bloated
[2:12:48] Xyvez: I love classic and SOD but honestly ive been wondering on trying on retail raiding.... idk why
[2:12:49] shinra40: to old
[2:12:49] romani_aurion: People were hyped for TBC because it opened the option that later Wotlk would be there
[2:12:50] Turbonerd_TV: @Savix they have era for classic no changes andys. They can bring all the tbc raids for example just leave out the flying
[2:12:57] AwongTV: Nah SOD has been great it’s boring playing old classic with the same known meta over and over again
[2:13:01] casualfriendly: Retail is far from bad. But something is off for me in it, and I cant get my head around it. Anyone feel the same?
[2:13:06] geennaamnl1: Retail is just different than classic and stuff . I like how retail looks like but im more a classic andyu
[2:13:07] TheVaroon: @Savix one Era server (per expansion) and one "fresh" every 2 years, then merge with Era and repeat
[2:13:11] MikeyMacaroni: retail is hard to get into, they need to revamp the new player experience
[2:13:18] Deadge_Gartic: @MikeyMacaroni that i agree
[2:13:27] yestrongedickboy: bullseed
[2:13:33] wolfman466: raid prison is great
[2:13:33] jtstroud: just dont jump right into mythic raid?
[2:13:33] Turbonerd_TV: @Savix they have era for classic no changes andys. They can bring all the tbc raids for example just leave out the flying
[2:13:34] xarnac: Not unless you are in the RWF
[2:13:40] ironcrenux: retail is fun at start, later it gets stale
[2:13:41] cianfromuruguay: fresh era server and merge it at 1 or 2 years like every other game does
[2:13:42] akillez69: As a person who likes pvp do you think well ever see actual competitive RBGs? Id like more options for pvp personally
[2:13:42] SodaBannedMe: I only mention retail cause we are always "lets go back to this lets go back to that" just make retail feel like the older expacs again. a bit of this a bit of that. let em cook
[2:13:46] OlimaruTV: you can talk between the queue times
[2:14:05] Dacoolface: I would hold out on Retail till the new expansion, currently its in te end of expansion blues. My whole guilds moved over to SoD for now.
[2:14:14] xarnac: Smurf on 1200 rated player om
[2:14:17] Xyvez: Probably not as sweaty as mythic raiding but retail raiding looks lnice
[2:14:18] misomander: did he ever watch the j1mmy video?

[2:16:02] cianfromuruguay: vanilla is fun to lvl up and get gear, they should release a new server every 1 or 2 years and merge it on era servers when all phases are done

[2:16:52] Turbonerd_TV: sod is fire
[2:16:54] Filley: @metetezell yes
[2:16:55] Xyvez: I dont think theyll open all of these era servers bc they dont want the player based too spread out thin
[2:16:55] hellscream_199: U cant make happy all
[2:16:57] djfreshmilkx: Sorry I was in arena
[2:16:57] CamGG__: I dont think 5 versions is a bad thing
[2:17:05] djfreshmilkx: My take is I love arena and I can't replace it in any other game
[2:17:09] Deadge_Gartic: @Xyvez its already ultra spread tbh
[2:17:20] metetezell: @Filley its his thing, he sounds like a 🤖

[2:17:37] realbonfire: Arena should just be separate from WOW entirely
[2:17:38] MeisteryZH: i just like the fresh experience where everyone starts at the same point, sod sratches that itch for me and is really fun especially with the levelcaps

[2:20:10] FiryWynter: Yeah, I hard agree. It's about audience accessibility. The thing about League, or Valorant, is that each "Character" has at most, like 5 skills. In WoW, the interactions are so complicated. Look at your skills and active items, etc.
[2:20:12] hellscream_199: @Savix WOD arena fine

[2:24:48] Honorbringer_: After the fact that healers wont die, I think that the greatest problem of WoW PvP is, that is is simply not fun because almost everyone can do everything. Everyone can heal, stun, cc, etc. I think Wrath has best balancing, because not everyone can do everything
[2:24:54] Deadge_Gartic: yeah i would play it too
[2:24:55] hellscream_199: its call Sven with maelstorm

[2:26:48] itsBdaws: I think boomers who haven’t played wow pvp since legion or even earlier shouldn’t make “I think the best pvp was” statements they’re completely out of the loop with modern retail pvp(I’m not talking bout you savix)
[2:26:50] Cosroka: @Smallifyouask1 enjoy it man !

[2:27:16] Deadge_Gartic: azamous skipped half of tbc btw LULW
[2:27:24] metetezell: Only problem is dividing the playerbase I guess and azamous is right.

[2:27:52] FlareChonDesu: Just run an expansion server for milions of people .. that won't cost at all no..
[2:28:04] Deadge_Gartic: all i see is praise tbh
[2:28:05] BeastAFTV: hope they dont make anything TBC. keep pallys ally and shamans on horde

[2:28:34] casualfriendly: SoD is the best that the classic cummunity got so far
[2:28:34] dirtyburger3: if you played a warrior youd think differently
[2:28:37] NeeNs50: Classic players just jump ship so fast like it's only phase 2

[2:28:44] Deadge_Gartic: for now
[2:28:45] iamthedengus: Lol you did what Savix
[2:28:46] MaTTTTeR: Classic dev team is the best thing from blizzard in awhile, feels like indie devs almost
[2:28:47] Deadge_Gartic: maybe 5 years later
[2:28:51] cheshtang91: i thinkk the way dev responds to us in SOD has been the best thing to come from blizzard, for real
[2:28:54] Hoshma46: they should add the fuh emote to the game
[2:28:55] Bundif: SOD is definitely feeling nice, i can't speak for any other version of wow
[2:28:55] valyrie__: @dirtyburger3 then just lvl a rogue
[2:28:56] IzNoGooDMk: Retail Devs def. hate the playerbase Sadge
[2:29:00] Deadge_Gartic: @Hoshma46 frfr
[2:29:04] Deadge_Gartic: they should add fuh class
[2:29:09] Turbonerd_TV: @Savix sod is fire. I just hope they never bring flyign to sod, to much quality of life in general
[2:29:11] highkingkevin: they just need to give back sco[id and we good
[2:29:15] Hoshma46: @Deadge_Gartic CHILLS

[2:29:27] Cjpriest: it will never happen because people just love to cry on twitter and forums

[2:29:56] OlimaruTV: I love flying tbh
[2:29:59] casualfriendly: If we just think about the STV boss killing. It was the most epic thing since the classic relaunch imo
[2:30:04] balithos: Pennsylvania LMAO
[2:30:09] IzNoGooDMk: They can easily fix that with an item that dismounts ppl though
[2:30:11] cheshtang91: no no no flying pls…
[2:30:15] ironcrenux: limit zones where u can fly
[2:30:15] CamGG__: even just questing etc makes everything so easy. skip so much of the world.
[2:30:15] vahngogeta: just add demounting rocket
[2:30:16] churuby: i like that u dismount on phase1, when u take damage
[2:30:18] atramades: devs think they r never wrong but it s starting to change recently in blizz
[2:30:23] geennaamnl1: SoD devs doing it amazing on 90% of the things. But them saying they are doing something bout botting while I reported the same bots for 5 days and they are still there on day 6 blows my mind
[2:30:26] churuby: it was cool for wpvp
[2:30:45] Deadge_Gartic: bfa got shitted sl wasnt good either

[2:31:51] TkingAJ: ashran was so laggy
[2:31:52] hellscream_199: @Savix they add net for catch fly but this isnt work well
[2:31:57] valyrie__: Legion is the best xpac
[2:31:58] Eelz255: @geennaamnl1 Strange take. During your job do you always get back to your customers or respond to emails and NEVER have it go longer than intended?
[2:31:59] casualfriendly: I secretly like Thorgast. Until the point I realised how many hours do I have to put in to progress... then the curtain fell :D :D
[2:32:02] Deadge_Gartic: @d2jayden i liked 8.3.5 but the rest KMS
[2:32:03] Zyleus: WoD was worse at the time than in hindsight
[2:32:04] RinneganTV: The Legendary weapons in Legion was just so awesome and the way you could improve your weapon
[2:32:04] cheshtang91: ret in legion was def my fav
[2:32:05] Atrojov: to be honest I expected they might bring some kind of achievements sod, like with hc addon
[2:32:07] SodaBannedMe: Ashran was fun if you played on the outskirts or a stealth class. Going in the back or side lines and taking people out. Taking their artifacts for honor
[2:32:09] DankDaddyFlex: Shadowlands was decent at the end imo

[2:35:26] IzNoGooDMk: @Deadge_Gartic Still bloat imo though (I don't really like the current talent trees either)
[2:35:34] Cjpriest: they need to get back to the basics where every class doesnt have a kick, stun, mobility, silence and all that shit
[2:35:35] ctrlbeesy: savixSmirk
[2:35:37] cheshtang91: i want my temp verdict back
[2:35:39] _의문의사나이: Mr savix my country is banned from twitch

[2:35:41] TripHH: monk has like 45 buttons you use on retail and its so annoying
[2:35:42] carrbon_2k: @Savix  MY MAN LOVE THE CUT BUT.... i feel like you went the most korean anime haircut possible way  ahaha
[2:35:43] MeisteryZH: do you think they are already working on wow2?
[2:35:44] kunchan: @SodaBannedMe these graphics don't have charm unless you have nostalgia
[2:35:47] thebigdongerhere: Wow2 and draenor? Wtf no thanks
[2:35:49] Deadge_Gartic: @IzNoGooDMk i dont like the talent trees either but for different reason , they are just copy of old spell book looking like you have choices
[2:35:53] veiloflonelystars: Aware
[2:35:54] Madwo: NOOOOOOOOOO

[2:36:09] FeralTami: BangerBand
[2:36:10] sk0q: what are you gonna do in korea
[2:36:13] BocoFish: I would like to try Wrath era but with dragonflight classes and improved dungeon and raid mechanics
[2:36:16] MochiMurloc: BangerBand
[2:36:17] WoofSilver: savixO7 savixO7
[2:36:19] Hoshma46: WoD could have been one of the best expacs but they dropped the ball with it aaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAa
[2:36:23] Tycusfindlay: BangerBand
[2:36:27] IzNoGooDMk: @Deadge_Gartic Exactly, to be fair u got some choice but overall it's just not good imo
[2:36:29] ctrlbeesy: wow 2: season of disappointment
[2:36:35] mrthiccpurple: BangerBand
[2:36:41] listrel1: How about you read the Templar tree right NOW
[2:36:41] veiloflonelystars: i would not be suprised if they did wow 2 and did a new world map like azeroth was back then but something new after they are finished with the world saga 3 expansions
[2:36:46] edeni: It's time Savix, time to watch WOD cinematic again
[2:36:53] kunchan: so....retail's talent trees
[2:36:54] Turbonerd_TV: @savix how about wow2 but a totally diff story and more then 2 factions?
[2:36:54] SodaBannedMe: @kunchan Hmm maybe. Im a nintendo guy, i like charm in simplicity. bdo graphics will be dated in 10 years, better irl art whereas wow art will never go stale. IMO tho ofc
[2:36:58] WoofSilver: @Hoshma46 I havent experienced it but I hear the content drought was horrible bingFeels
[2:37:00] Traitmark: @Hoshma46   So True  aaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAa
[2:37:08] phopheter: go look at the ret hero talents, they're out
[2:37:27] Zaroiuon: hero talent trees only have only a few choice nodes, most are fixed
[2:37:32] Turbonerd_TV: @savix how about wow2 but a totally diff story and more then 2 factions?
[2:37:39] Drugbearr: hi savix
[2:37:41] LyteGod: Mr Savix can we get a lil gifted sub to mr kony or something the man cant sub Train
[2:37:44] jahnks212: You ever do PVE?
[2:37:45] Hoshma46: @WoofSilver it's generally agreed that the first patch was great, they just fumbled the rest of it peepoSad
[2:37:45] HidekiKojima: I’m have a slow ass chat with dell support LULW I hope I’m not late for raid
[2:37:47] Deadge_Gartic: @IzNoGooDMk some classes actually have good talent trees but i would say some of them are really bad . I'm playing fury war and my talent tree is basically dogcrap gutting my baseline abilties from forever. It's bad when you realize your only spender is a talent which is rampage lmao
[2:37:51] veiloflonelystars: @Hoshma46 and wod without garrisons would have been much better, shitiest implementation ever when they could have designed instanced city housing that was costumizable
[2:37:52] toerray: the hero talents?
[2:37:59] ctrlbeesy: yes
[2:37:59] TripHH: thats kinda what hero talents are
[2:38:02] Spoobzilla: Like last epoch
[2:38:10] Asehlol: more passives
[2:38:13] IzNoGooDMk: @Savix I had that same idea for current talents! That's what they should have done 100%
[2:38:13] Deadge_Gartic: @Savix hero talents are basically something that enhances 1 playstyle
[2:38:23] Cryptoji_Jojoji: LE is pretty fun
[2:38:27] Atrojov: I was thinking to combine for example 2 runes into one new rune or smth like that
[2:38:28] listrel1: Deadge make him read the paladin hero tree for ret aaaa
[2:38:28] Fiffy: epoach Pog

[2:39:06] MeisteryZH: retail might be cool but its too hard for me and the fact that i'm so behind on all cool items and transmog feels bad
[2:39:07] Turbonerd_TV: @savix imagine wow 2
[2:39:10] sickish: isn't there a holy pal talent where it calls down beams of light people have to stand in?
