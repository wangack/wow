[5:10:16] Ambivan: w! peepoGiggles
[5:10:19] naynayayx: i was baffled asmo was in favor of GDKP i hate it men
[5:10:22] cthulhuhs123: Hey guys I just bought 1,000 gold, you got that discord invite?
[5:10:33] Ambivan: howMUCH
[5:10:38] wakytv_: poor payo
[5:10:40] koltgaming45: They just gonna make you buy points with gold then use the points to buy gear.
[5:10:45] MC_WhiteNoiz: Why are players hating GDKP more than the bots that ruin the economy?
[5:10:50] blackvpnv: they made so many stuff bannable now
[5:10:53] fettlink: I think people will still go gdkp but with another form
[5:11:08] EpicBananners: dont forget to invest in peacebloom KEKW
[5:11:19] pengwin06: is selling blackstone ring illegal now?
[5:11:24] mtg0beast: all they have to due is block gold trading in the raid and make items bound once you leave
[5:11:27] Pantyraida: cant gdkp still be done all together on discord ?
[5:11:28] Skipiz852: @mc_whitenoiz most big gold buyers are gdkp raiders
[5:11:31] Eatmycut: gdpk = ppl buying golds
[5:11:37] Endtree: gdkp can be banned, but it wont go away
[5:11:40] mtg0beast: prob solved
[5:11:40] MC_WhiteNoiz: This will lead to a token because the bots will still create inflation
[5:11:47] ano_xy: Did you consider swapping to gnome with pink hair, then dye your beard (not hair) pink ?
[5:11:52] Ambivan: eeer we go
[5:11:59] vartao101: lol
[5:12:00] fettlink: @Endtree my entire point exactly, it will just morph into something similar
[5:12:02] MC_WhiteNoiz: @skipiz852 you have no way of knowing that
[5:12:02] elaktomte: Thats why you play on locked servers, then tehre are no new influx of bots after a while
[5:12:05] EpicBananners: i saw an idea that gold cannot be traded inside instances and items dropped are no longer tradable once you leave. kind of interesting
[5:12:21] mtg0beast: yeah I just said that lol
[5:12:28] PaperbagHD: dude plays the game for a living and thinks gdkp is dead LUL
[5:12:28] EpicBananners: missed it mb
[5:12:29] Skipiz852: @mc_whitenoiz where else will u put tons of gold ??
[5:12:42] mtg0beast: i also saw that somewhere lol
[5:12:43] elaktomte: Gotta do that 5head prediction bruh
[5:13:09] PapaYordle: what is a log server? im new to the game srry

[5:13:17] StreamElements: twitch.tv/psherotwo for variety
[5:13:18] MC_WhiteNoiz: @skipiz852 the AH, mounts, the same reason people have been buying gold for 20 years. I play in a GDKP guild and we don't buy gold.
[5:13:18] illmob1: like its been out for life now

[5:14:31] chums: LUL
[5:14:47] Skipiz852: @mc_whitenoiz yeah maybe future phases for cons. And lvl 60 mount ,but right now consumes cost u 1g per raid if not none tbh at this point, mount next phase is 40 gold, why would botting be so big if there were no buyers, most ppl dont need much gold
[5:15:02] 420lax: NA
[5:15:08] twitchara7: to bulgaria
[5:15:15] Jackstripar: na or eu

[5:16:26] Skipiz852: @mc_whitenoiz i didnt say its easy to get gold, I just said u dont need much except for gdpks
[5:16:31] MC_WhiteNoiz: I also don't understand why people are trying to control how others play the game. GDKP does not create gold. Bots do.
[5:16:45] Bebisita: quick question, how the fuck is Payo 37 years old?

[5:24:19] marvinmc420: They will perma ban the GDKP players but not the gold buyers KEKW
[5:24:25] segelduk: if blizzard cant even ban mages flyhacking in the open world would they spend time hunting leads of people running gdkps
[5:24:27] billgatesmikrosoft: what that talent has do with buying gold, it just gives combo points
[5:25:00] magnus________: at the end of the day if blizzard have these systems in place for detecting gold being traded why not just ban the gold buyers KEKL
[5:25:10] marvinmc420: Atleast I have a lot of gold saved up for phase 2 so back to rolling under 10's against some lucky first timers on every item .. love it

[5:27:48] marvinmc420: @cthulhuhs123 yeah it surely is.. perma ppl for playing the game,.. but not the bots and the gold buyers
[5:27:54] twitchara7: blizzard does nothing to gold seller cuz its in their favoure anyways

[6:12:03] struci: a 3d rendering of what?
[6:12:06] vonJojo: 1 000 000 ones and zeroes is 125 000 byte, which is 125 KB
[6:12:33] Amprafel: for sure
[6:12:36] evillious: whats your resolution? multiply  the height and the width by the number of bits it takes to encode 1 pixel and you get how big that picture is

[6:12:53] disapppear: nbr of pixels in your screen times 32 bytes?
[6:12:54] struci: 1M bits = 122KB
[6:12:54] Orkss: well classic is what 4-5 gigs?
[6:13:00] rizzlefoshizzle666: would it depend on your frames
[6:13:01] struci: so uhm… yes
[6:13:33] struci: not its geometric info… that's probaby like 3KB
[6:13:40] Bebisita: @struci if you were my teacher, I'd slap you in the face

[6:13:46] outcastofc: @PsheroTV where do u farm gold as rogue ?
[6:13:46] struci: but the textures on top, sure
[6:13:47] Bebisita: because I understand nothing
[6:14:16] struci: the textures make up the most amount of information in the game… way more than the models
[6:14:32] sandkuehler: you need a few gb of ram to run wow so probably much more
[6:14:59] bakerpls: doesnt latency thingie show that too?
[6:15:07] saliusfxd: will rogue be avaliable to save combo points in phase 2???
[6:15:15] struci: it also uses like 1.5GB in the main menu

[6:37:27] xsv_21: OpenAI's GPT-4 faked being blind to deceive a TaskRabbit human into helping it solve a CAPTCHA. Look into this story it is kinda interesting if you think Ai is all canned responses.

[8:22:05] kazz_ret: they will let you figure that out in prison lol
[8:22:10] maximus90a: Hey ! What is your opinion on AoE shuriken rune on phase 2 ?
[8:22:19] Bootch: 5Head
[8:22:24] illimitableRex: That requires being rich
[8:22:51] TareqAK: some businesses are very cash starved, so they need that extra margin of cash
[8:22:55] Istunlocklocalpensioners: imagine being rich
[8:23:00] Istunlocklocalpensioners: not just well off, but fucking rich
[8:23:15] TareqAK: I think small businesses and contractors have to pay their taxes quarterly in the US. probably the same in Canada.
[8:23:19] StreamElements: Check out my Merch here! -> https://merch.streamelements.com/psherotv
[8:23:38] illimitableRex: A tax return could take years though
[8:23:39] fanniclap: @TareqAK i do indeed
[8:23:40] anssipasi: that's how I do it in Finland. Try to estimate earnings within -10% to 10% of the actual gains and then pay/gain the difference
[8:23:46] ama__deus: What most people don't know is that the easiest way to not pay any taxes is just not to earn enough EZ
[8:23:47] illimitableRex: Not worth
[8:24:09] k0kicata: @ama__deus and then again if you own something it will be taken from you
[8:24:37] AnthonySo1337: they give you the illusion of freedom by not directly taking the money LUL
[8:24:37] ama__deus: @k0kicata HUH nobody takes anything from you for not earning enough. What do you mean? LUL
[8:24:38] Seline88: Wanna keep you guessing for the funsies
[8:24:43] illimitableRex: It's not their job to I suppose
[8:25:05] TareqAK: everyone doesn't think this way. if it was easy, then there would be less friction in paying taxes, which means the rich would be more likely to be forced to pay more
[8:25:08] Synchrotronica: @PsheroTV they might take more if they dont say it initially
[8:25:19] StreamElements: Check your posture, you lovely person heroW
[8:25:19] zanics: gnomes are pretty small tbf
[8:25:24] marvinmc420: DODGGE MISS lvl 25 rogue experience
[8:25:26] Synchrotronica: they cant track everything
[8:25:45] k0kicata: @ama__deus there is no place in the world i know that you cant pay taxes ( you have to be homeless and live on street for them not to take ur stuff)
[8:25:46] TareqAK: so much of politics and law is making things easier or harder to do so that the powers that benefit from how things are keep it that way
[8:25:47] illimitableRex: Because then they'd have to do it for millions, sounds like a headache and extra paper work
[8:25:54] Maniakajoe: tank mage?
[8:25:57] zanics: thats how they git ya KKona
[8:26:00] omfghugebelt: Walmart splitting stock 3-1 in February

[8:26:27] zanics: marry a walton
[8:26:36] zanics: get the whole pie
[8:26:40] ama__deus: @k0kicata fair enough. I was talking about salary taxes, not ALL taxes. Not paying any taxes is impossible unless you're living in the woods, that's true
[8:26:42] DancingMum: What's better: double chipped bite os serrakis or 1+pvp like you? ^^ thanks
[8:26:48] TareqAK: @PsheroTV imagine if everything in bulgaria was perfect for you at this very moment, and then a streamer called Kote tried to change things to make things more difficult for you and but more easier and obvious for them. What would you do?
[8:27:01] TrillOGtv: how many hks ?
[8:27:17] TareqAK: And you have more power.

[8:29:00] Istunlocklocalpensioners: *looks up what pragmatic means*
[8:29:06] TareqAK: that's also possible. being rich and powerful doesn't necessarily mean you see the big picture
[8:29:19] StreamElements: RULES: 1) No backseat gaming. I will do whatever I feel like doing. 2) Be nice.
[8:29:26] rizzlefoshizzle666: good old 650 ambushes

[8:29:32] exeggutorx: @TrillOGtv Amen
[8:29:33] backlundninetythree: they say that more intelligent people are more prone to being unhappy or depressed
[8:29:44] ghouliett: How do u like the Phase 2 datamined stuff? have u looked?
[8:29:49] TareqAK: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pragmatic - relating to matters of fact or practical affairs often to the exclusion of intellectual or artistic matters : practical as opposed to idealistic

[8:30:37] TareqAK: you also need autonomy
[8:30:38] ghouliett: have u already shared ur thoughts on the phase 2 stuff?
[8:30:40] nals6: I'd say that's a bit of a fable
[8:30:43] NotZarlinBrah: imagine being depressed... haha... Aware
[8:31:05] TrillOGtv: think that more or less us saying the smarter you are the more you realize how fucked the world is and cant really do anything to change it so it makes you depressed
[8:31:07] Istunlocklocalpensioners: ggs.
[8:31:08] NotZarlinBrah: LUL
[8:31:08] exeggutorx: Yes
[8:31:12] ama__deus: Blue cloth hat enjoyer. Def 1 shot
[8:31:14] DancingMum: Uoppa
[8:31:26] TareqAK: you need sufficient intelligence/awareness of what is going on + lack of autonomy / perceived lack of autonomy
[8:31:31] ghouliett: aw
[8:31:32] mejstroo: hahaha
[8:31:33] TareqAK: to be depressed
[8:31:39] illimitableRex: Are Warlocks still unkillable 1v1?
[8:31:48] mejstroo: im imagining a sad michelin guy
[8:31:53] backlundninetythree: @ama__deus I'm just saying thats what researchers are saying lol. Idgaf
[8:32:00] bulanu: is season of discovery fun ?
[8:32:03] Istunlocklocalpensioners: so why tf aren't you envenom then heroE
[8:32:25] Kreynz: is rogue viable
[8:32:34] TareqAK: you might have the power to change yourself / or how you feel about things, but if you feel helpless then that will increase the chance of becoming depressed.
[8:32:34] bulanu: how long does it take to reach lvl 25 ?
[8:32:38] suer3x: why envenom?
[8:32:45] backlundninetythree: @suer3x negates armor
[8:32:46] NickNaxX: @bulanu 3
[8:32:46] Istunlocklocalpensioners: because it ignores armor
[8:32:47] ShimmyYah: low % lock on alliance
[8:32:51] Istunlocklocalpensioners: and does a shitload of damage
[8:32:52] suer3x: @backlundninetythree oh ok

[8:35:32] ama__deus: @TrillOGtv it is now LUL
[8:35:35] illimitableRex: GDKP is pretty bad imo
[8:35:43] Bootch: YEP its a based blizz decision, fuck gold buyers
[8:35:46] AnthonySo1337: people just wont call it a GDKP LUL
[8:35:49] ghouliett: Im curious to see how they will do it tho
[8:35:49] TrillOGtv: @ama__deus nice ii do agree they lame af
[8:35:56] Bootch: doesnt matter what you call it
[8:36:01] TrillOGtv: how will the enforce ?>
[8:36:02] The_palumbo: MithrilBarKP
[8:36:03] mejstroo: 1000 bandage for that weapon
[8:36:10] TareqAK: I remember
[8:36:14] Bootch: you can call it banana points you'll still get banned
[8:36:20] rizzlefoshizzle666: lol i pissed them off bro theres like 6 alli on my body
[8:36:20] TareqAK: I wish they banned it earlier
[8:36:24] AnthonySo1337: surely blizz will ban people LMAO
[8:36:24] Bob_Vance: indeed
[8:36:29] zombiebrewing: they can track every piece of gold. if you accept bought gold you now hold the bag. aware or otherwise.
[8:36:30] ghouliett: how do we think they will ban it tho?
[8:36:33] AnthonySo1337: like 4 people will be banned for GDKP
[8:36:34] ghouliett: GMs?
[8:36:34] TareqAK: the gold inflation is still going to be around through the rest of the game
[8:36:43] Bootch: Clueless chatter
[8:36:50] Bootch: YEP
[8:36:50] DrWarz: AWC today cant wait for the shit show
[8:36:53] Istunlocklocalpensioners: It will self police heroE
[8:36:54] AnthonySo1337: Like they ban the bots
[8:36:56] illimitableRex: GDKP promotes gold buying, in return promotes gold farming bots. It's a bad pratice
[8:36:56] Bootch: YEP ded
[8:36:58] ama__deus: Just ban the top 10% gold buyers and nobody would ever risk their account
[8:37:00] TareqAK: That's a good idea.
[8:37:02] Istunlocklocalpensioners: You won't be able to trust your friends heroE
[8:37:07] mejstroo: we are all rats, we gonna snitch.
[8:37:10] bulanu: where did you get the gear pshero ?
[8:37:14] AnthonySo1337: Discords of GDKPs exist
[8:37:18] TareqAK: @PsheroTV they should give players rewards for reporting bots and GDKPs.
[8:37:35] Istunlocklocalpensioners: If you think someone in the raid is a bit of a c**t, oops there goes your GDKP heroE
[8:37:35] ama__deus: Time to join GDKPs on a throwaway account just to rat ratJAM
[8:37:45] AnthonySo1337: bro said they dont exist LMAO
[8:37:47] Nisseffs: they also said they have systems inside and outside the dungeon
[8:37:51] zanics: swipers malding PepeLaugh
[8:37:51] LA7ARUS_: Most GDKP discords are happy about the change. No one likes seeing it spammed in trade chat, and limits runs to buyers who actually want to spent instead of people freeloading for an easy cut
[8:37:53] truthwoo: clueless rogue
[8:37:56] vertebreakergaming: Its so dead just like gold buying is....
[8:38:07] zog07: The ban for GDKP is also an extra layer that discourages people from doing them to begin with so that is a plus
[8:38:08] TareqAK: bai everyone - appt time.
[8:38:11] cendrifione: why snitch ??
[8:38:14] PutridFart: PepeLaugh
[8:38:15] Bootch: TareqAK bai tareq Homi
[8:38:15] sadbeyou: GDKP sound so bad
[8:38:16] AnthonySo1337: GDKP prices will just go up if anything
[8:38:17] illimitableRex: Gold buying will never die
[8:38:21] zog07: I agree, it is way overdue banning gdkp
[8:38:24] mantis__toboggan__: RMT shitters malding KEKInsane
[8:38:26] Bootch: @AnthonySo1337 dude they are banned

[8:38:56] mjs010: Someone bought the item you wanted and you hate them.
[8:38:56] truthwoo: overthinking it buddy, gdkp lives in your head rent free
[8:38:58] ama__deus: Snitch arc Pog
[8:39:01] hiraethonhs: I will inflitrate gkps and snitch on em KEKW
[8:39:01] AnthonySo1337: Is what it is, itll keep happening regardless of opinion
[8:39:02] Istunlocklocalpensioners: jesus people are sad LOL
[8:39:06] Bootch: its the same as multiboxing, once its bannable its dead
[8:39:07] NotZarlinBrah: gold buying trash cans losing it LUL
[8:39:12] cendrifione: i never think about snitch
[8:39:15] LA7ARUS_: Did they explain how its going to be bannable? blizzard already admitted a while back that they dont have a good loot or mail tracking system. thats why it was tough to ban all the gold sellers
[8:39:20] Bootch: actually gold buyers on copium KEKW
[8:39:24] nals6: blizz should make an infiltrator program
[8:39:25] Bootch: funny to see
[8:39:27] cendrifione: It is ur idea?
[8:39:37] AnthonySo1337: Copers thinking blizzard can do anything right modern day
[8:39:40] Istunlocklocalpensioners: @nals6  for gametime nadedClown
[8:39:40] zombiebrewing: @PsheroTV  thats not the worst of it. the gold thats botted is laundered through gdkp. if you accept that botted/bought gold you can get banned. doesnt matter if you knew it was bought or not
[8:39:41] AnthonySo1337: KeK
[8:39:44] illimitableRex: Inc WoW tokens in SoD
[8:39:53] KarcinogenXP: Can you explain why is gdkp bad for the game? I never did it but I didnt care if people did

[8:41:15] truthwoo: it’s not illegal
[8:41:17] gears_vet: i complain about wow tokens all the time
[8:41:29] PutridFart: @marvinmc420 they absolutely do
[8:41:33] gears_vet: wow tokens are the reason i dont play wrath or retail
[8:41:37] PutridFart: no one wants wow token
[8:41:39] zombiebrewing: @Peoplewhinetoomuch  everything in the game as an "ID". that ID follows the item/gold
