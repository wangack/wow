[1:00:20] oraclespyro: im confused too
[1:00:20] pavepawns: rest drops
[1:00:50] uhhhhyeayoo: Yes you can only buy 3 pieces from the raids

[1:01:38] manmower: can get a normal piece, but still have to bring it through upgrade process
[1:01:57] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: should be nice for trinkets like old warriors soul and stuff
[1:02:03] oraclespyro: wait hows the dom sockets gonna work @Towelliee

[1:02:37] pavepawns: and depending on difficulty you could be sitting with a 310ilvl old warrior soul
[1:02:53] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: @oraclehuntar i believe its stated there that dom sockets shouldn't work. you can however get highter tier pieces.
[1:03:08] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: higher*
[1:03:13] oraclespyro: oh ok
[1:03:20] pavepawns: i think it was 310
[1:03:31] sporquelle: What item level u are now?
[1:03:32] pavepawns: gimme a sec ill try and find it
[1:03:34] manmower: mythic from last raid is normal ilevel for next tier
[1:03:41] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: should be 310 yes. the avg mythic lvl should be 304
[1:04:24] manmower: also the raids on rotations, so you have to wait 3 weeks for another chance at raid?
[1:04:41] BoezIRL: helloooo towHAMUP
[1:04:56] mewkittymon: 252 is normal hero is 265 and Mitch is 272 item lv gear
[1:04:59] Keyastaron_: it is
[1:05:06] manmower: so you might need those deterministic items
[1:05:23] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: i've checked a bit the vendors and what i've seen that the trinket from shriekwing does almost 8k more dmg than dreadfire vessel baseed on the same ilvl and cd xD
[1:05:37] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: based*
[1:05:40] Jarlan23: dreadfire vessel could be good
[1:05:48] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: @Towelliee on wowhead they also said a world boss will drop fated gear
[1:05:52] Jarlan23: the one from sire
[1:05:53] manmower: 278 Macabre Sheet Music
[1:05:53] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: shriekwind does like 34k phys dmg

[1:06:18] vetsttv: danflohr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[1:06:20] Keyastaron_: also @towelliee you can get 3 coins that's it .. to spend on any gear from the raid venders
[1:06:21] havenbirch: Think the Fated Raids will be hard?
[1:06:24] Shirey36: the problem with CN will be finding tanks to run it when their trinkets are from SoD. at least in the pug world
[1:06:50] ijuki: @Shirey36 You might want the currency to upgrade the gear from the vendor
[1:07:05] Warcsman: Do you still need to farm path of flying in order to fly in the game or can you buy flying right away??
[1:07:11] manmower: so we'll still me making tier at the catalyst in season 4
[1:07:15] pavepawns: so m+ upgraded ilvl goes up to 300ilvl. mythic loot goes 304-310 (310 being the last bosses extra increase)
[1:07:28] I_c_E_c_U_b_E: if people are after the achievement and raid teleports there shouldn't be a problem
[1:07:29] TheCliffyShow: Yo, @Towelliee! You seen the new KSM mount for season 4. They are changing it's color.
[1:07:35] pavepawns: so yes a 310 old warrior soul should be dropable

[3:06:40] Snabido: George Constanza would write a book if he had such an experience
[3:06:43] KillchainGames: do you think 9.2.5 will fix faction imbalance or is horde still gonna be the better for content etc?
[3:07:36] Atryark: @Snabido Kramer prolly already had the idea for that theater, they stole it from him!
[3:08:49] Armdel: cross faction guilds would probably put a decent dent in the faction balance issue
[3:08:53] danksly: alliance joins the horde finally 'unofficially'
[3:09:22] Bayne77: no @Towelliee .   you are a huntard.  play it right.  YOU  do all the pulls.
[3:09:34] KillchainGames: basically im a wow vet but wife kids job etc life....so dont get to sink my teeth like i want to and being so limited time im wondering whether i should just bite bullet and go horde...any suggestions chat?

[3:10:07] skymercii: oof a disc priest
[3:10:26] KillchainGames: horde it is i have been convinced!

[3:10:55] KillchainGames: legit i have been alliance for 16+ years
[3:11:00] MBG_95: @Dad_v_Game 9.2.5 is right round the corner, surely you can wait a month or two before making the change?
[3:11:13] KillchainGames: ^ valid...
[3:11:15] eybom: Nothing bold about playing horde
[3:11:22] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  heavy u read on wowhead that s4 might be shorter duration?
[3:11:30] epiczplz: binding shot help a tank out
[3:11:56] MBG_95: from what I understand, the only thing which will still be restricted is guilds + therefore Mythic raid. if you are stuck for time anyway I am guessing you dont hardcore raid?

[3:12:11] Riszyn: The ability to raid with the other faction is going to help but it isn't going to revive Alliance, and this thought that a lot of people will pay to swap back just because of that is far fetched.

[3:12:41] Steelsky_: Man they should integrate Luxthos Weak auras into the default UI :P
[3:12:50] KillchainGames: @MBG_95 correct i dont have time to raid so its mainly about the instanced content that cross faction WOULD help with yes....but not sure if its just flat out better if i bite bullet and swap =(
[3:13:22] epiczplz: @Dad_v_Game i think you should just swap and try it what the worst that happends
[3:13:32] MBG_95: I would just see how it goes in 9.2.5, if it hasnt helped then change and get ready for 10.0
[3:13:45] Riszyn: @Dad_v_Game You would most likely have to faction and realm change to see a big difference in the community. It's posssible to find Alliance servers, just more rare

[3:17:15] gzus81: @ZielonaZelka try looking in bfa zones, pretty sure the world quests drop over 80 ilvl gear

You're expected to know all the routes, mark prio mobs, keep aggro, etc. I've been tanking for many years and have the luxury of learning along with friends, but if I started from scratch today on my own I don't think I would play a tank
[3:20:19] danksly: what would be the harm in the encrypted affix being base for all dungeons in a season

[3:20:23] danksly: never thought about it
[3:20:27] PvtHudson093: make the seasonal affix the +2 affix instead of the +9 affix?
[3:20:30] Mistery836: 20 mins is the best
[3:20:48] manmower: 3 boss dungeons
[3:20:52] Clicklesly: Tbh i'm hesitant tanking on alts cause i can't remember non-Encrypted routes anymore...
[3:21:17] danksly: md the warlock so they can soak some of this necrotic PepeLaugh
[3:21:21] MBG_95: just too big a blaster
[3:21:30] daxirr1: You need to use misdirect way more
[3:21:37] Hoodie187: @towelliee how was dr strange 2?

[3:23:10] Eviltuna13: i have MD on a macro tied into my Milti-shot
[3:23:14] hatsihansu: not dying to aggro is quite a dps boost tho
[3:23:15] Lupine_Fury: not being dead is the dps boost
[3:23:17] PvtHudson093: @iProhesiv I cant stand pugging keys, i run all my keys with my guild
[3:23:26] Keyastaron_: you used it 3 times back to back? lmaoo
[3:23:34] Clicklesly: There's a good MD+focus macro that helps if you get used to using it between each pull ^^
[3:23:40] sklingel: tank losing aggro is this classic
[3:23:44] d_elven_lord: @PvtHudson093 SAME
[3:23:48] BloomsCrux: as long as you're mounted your pet can't pull aggro
[3:23:49] Murlock07: llo
[3:23:53] danksly: mount up, if ur mounted ur pets brons n stuff cant pull
[3:23:54] Rottencoarse: rip

[3:24:17] MBG_95: someone sent the spear I think :D
[3:24:18] Rottencoarse: next time

[3:24:39] danksly: brons ma boi
[3:24:46] zeviika: what did bron do
[3:24:48] MBG_95: Bron Cena from downtown
[3:24:49] manmower: bronroy jenkins
[3:24:51] PvtHudson093: And every time i think about pugging a key, I remember sitting there for an hour+ trying to get into a key and log off and watch something instead
[3:24:52] sotsil_: @Towelliee just mount up. Pets dont aggro then
[3:24:52] danksly: if ur mounted he cant pull u just gotta mount
[3:24:52] skymercii: wait that aff lock is venthyr? wut
[3:24:56] Aquadriel: he is doing his best lirikANGRY
[3:24:57] Clicklesly: Just have to mount and not get into combat too fast ^^
[3:25:06] TheRukis: Bron cena
[3:25:07] Froudini: Bron is the secret 5th affix
[3:25:08] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Half an hour a go, i had Bron up and with invis potion, he didnt pull a thing
[3:25:10] zeviika: pets also dont aggro if not in combat, if tank waits for pets to run around pillar even not mounted, they dont pull
[3:25:14] im_capy: He aint no Jordan though #23
[3:25:18] zeviika: that is a tank not waiting 2 seconds to see thing
[3:25:19] 079Coffee: what level is this key @chat?
[3:25:30] danksly: KEKW
[3:25:30] Keyastaron_: @towelliee  you're able to dismiss bron from right clickong the buff in yr top right corners
[3:25:42] skymercii: KEKW
[3:25:44] d_elven_lord: What addon is it that lets you sell junk with one click?
[3:25:44] Kinghorn: a 7
[3:25:52] Keyastaron_: 7 @coffee_jpd
[3:25:53] MBG_95: that is perfect tanking etiqute, move away from DPS area abilities
[3:26:01] zeviika: d_elven_lord a ton of banking addons and bag addons do that.
[3:26:10] Crippyenergy: If you tank the boss close to a corner or something the adds are supposed to spawn way closer, he doesnt drag it far enough tho
[3:26:11] zeviika: d_elven_lord search junk on curseforge
[3:26:19] generaljosh721: That was an old strat wasn't it? Tank in the corner?
[3:26:27] Keyastaron_: LUL always @mbg_95
[3:26:28] ahies28: this is why l hate some tanks
[3:26:30] generaljosh721: So the adds don't spawn so far away
[3:26:33] d_elven_lord: @keyastaron_ @kurijomo thanks!
[3:26:41] Crippyenergy: JoshiPooh still works
[3:26:41] Froudini: I always tank him in the corner. Adds gets less spread out
[3:26:55] Bayne77: tanking from a healer perspective
[3:26:59] Keyastaron_: beta pog
[3:27:10] MBG_95: I mean Incarn in MDI just snapped the boss to give perfect add spawns :D
[3:27:26] Crippyenergy: they dont spawn on the boss anymore, but they spawn way closer making it easier to get them in
[3:27:30] Keyastaron_: dragon flight alpha beta when Kappa
[3:27:40] Froudini: It's still slightly easier with corner tanking. You eliminate 2 sides of potential spawn points
[3:27:43] danksly: was that the mdi last night? @mbg_95
[3:27:48] danksly: wanna see that
[3:28:02] MBG_95: @danksly no was from previous season

[3:56:28] KonaWolfeee: @towelliee headed to Miami tonight. 12 hour drive for tomorrow's F1 Miami grand prix. super stoked
[3:56:37] Sacr3dDatura: I think WoW is picking up steam again
[3:56:58] MayroVision: I got promoted dude. I’m moving to Raleigh NC
[3:57:07] skymercii: a normal 9-5 kept it Kappa
[3:57:09] Fugazi811: agree
[3:57:10] mavericks312: 9.2 started the movement
[3:57:16] Kinghorn: just relaxing before sunwell drops
[3:57:25] Riszyn: that's some pretty heft copium saying wow is piping hot lol
[3:57:30] Jollywhompus: i grerw up in raleigh
[3:57:33] Baaltaza: seqDuck
[3:57:35] antiajax10: @Towelliee You think youll play FF14 at all when the personal islands come out? a little FF garrison action?
[3:57:52] skymercii: what addon is that shows u the numbers?
[3:58:00] Bayne77: @MayroVision congrats.  im from that area, its very nice.  housing is insane though...
[3:58:02] KonaWolfeee: @riszyn it's definitely hot rn in prep for Dragonflight. but as always. it'll have its stale period. look at lost ark lol. every mmo has its ups and downs
[3:58:24] dewking93: @Towelliee  your the reason why i dps :)
[3:58:24] KonaWolfeee: FF14 KEKW
[3:58:27] Molvonos: Like Wildstar
[3:58:34] aeminence: The islands i think is their way to help people get an actual house or w/e since thats an issue for them
[3:58:35] oraclespyro: what addon is that showing you  the rating?
[3:58:41] Sacr3dDatura: what's your ilvl? what should we be for dragonsflight?
[3:58:46] SiXKiNG_: @dewking93 KEKW
[3:58:50] flickrmbskull: yea man I'm returning to wow after walking away for 3 years rn I'm just SURGING  thre the campaign chapters at the same time of lvling 3 new alts w my main to do the same to the end game content playing hard core catchup
[3:58:54] Rexialiton: FF14 KEKW WoW Kreygasm
[3:58:55] echoingtruth: i dont like the visual style of 14 im more of a western fantasy style
[3:59:00] Riszyn: @KonaWolfee You can say people are tenatively excited about the next expansion, but it's not "hot". It's the end of an exp, when everyone quits.
[3:59:12] antiajax10: @Towelliee Island Sanctuary in 6.2, everyone gets their own island sanctuary, not a ton of details so far. Like stardew valley for yourself
[3:59:14] KonaWolfeee: @riszyn touche
[3:59:23] Ryathael: No, thats not how it works. YoshiP specifically told us that it wasnt a housing replacement in one of the live letters.
[3:59:26] smolglizzy: My understanding is that its a personal Animal Crossing with a farm and a place for your in-game pets to run around.
[3:59:26] Murlock07: Tru
[3:59:47] Rexialiton: Even those who says "fuck wow" LUL
[3:59:48] CGd0c: 9.2.5 tripple lego?
[3:59:49] PvtHudson093: Loving that In Preach's district in FF14 that they have all locked their doors to stop the crawlers from entering
[3:59:53] swordart2022: YEP
[3:59:53] Fugazi811: do it
[3:59:59] CGd0c: do it
[4:00:01] Rictamar: Preach warns us of those cesspool guilds lol
[4:00:06] Murlock07: and then you Join and nobody talks and runs nothing
[4:00:08] Twisted_Dream: Hey
[4:00:09] Kinghorn: chadbomb is a 1 man army he dont need no guild
[4:00:19] Riszyn: @KonaWolfee And since the last 2-3 expansions have been ass, It's even less likely people are excited about Dragonflight.

[4:00:36] mmrghost7: in 9.2.5 they should let u use two leggo of ur choice instead of locking u to unity
[4:01:18] Kinghorn: LUL
[4:01:20] BriscoGDP: Are you allowed to run your own key or are you just wanting a different dungeon?
[4:01:27] Clicklesly: You can also search for something like 5-8 in the bar ^^
[4:01:42] enux337: they should remove lfr and replace it with low key queues
[4:01:48] bye_acc: Just type the number +7 and it will look for +6, +7, +8 @Towelliee
[4:01:51] jhonothesecond: Na they should just buff leggos that have seen zero play all xpack

[4:02:24] TheTrojanFart: what ilvl are u
[4:02:37] Lightninghandz: Im almost positive blizzard has just given up on shadowlands, i dont expect much at all for the rest of this xpac
[4:03:02] crittinkitten: If leggos didn't cost 50-100k gold they could buff the undertuned ones. but people will be mad if they have to buy another wow token for a new BIS leggo
[4:03:08] mavericks312: saying they gave up is a horrible take
[4:03:13] Sollice: @towelliee have you gotten a better weapon yet ?
[4:03:17] Notic: do we know when 925 comes out yet?
[4:03:24] manmower: they're going for smart content reuse instead of creating an extra tier
[4:03:28] Snabido: Sounds like someone wants a Ruby Sanctum raid Kappa
[4:03:40] ZibzRO: cause they scaped an intier patch man..... they give up and now they giive us some scraps to keep people in game as much as possible....
[4:03:46] mmrghost7: i mean there are alot of ppl who dont like to redo old content
[4:03:50] mavericks312: s4 id say is july early august
[4:03:56] Gutroan: Does that mean 9.2 also gets the different m+ rotation?
[4:03:58] Coriollis: 9.2.5 dragonflight release date announcement 🙏
[4:04:01] ZibzRO: i dont see any 9.3
[4:04:02] fakevaltteri: deephurting subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[4:04:03] ditaern: Well, maybe 'half-ass' is a better term. Otherwise we would have had 9.3 with a full raid tier
[4:04:05] Notic: ok sweet i just came back after quitting in 9.0
[4:04:08] ZibzRO: exactly
[4:04:11] ZibzRO: old dungeons reused
[4:04:12] mavericks312: mythic plus raiding sounds awesome
[4:04:14] epiczplz: sometimes chatters be crazy
[4:04:15] Lightninghandz: Where do you see this info on new dungeons? Im looking now and dont see that
[4:04:21] tetrahydridodinitrogen: the raid gearing system for season 4 seems interesting
[4:04:22] manmower: you get the highlight reel raids in s4
[4:04:29] swordart2022: Someone in chat is looking for reasons to be mad KEKW
[4:04:33] jerexify: If you don't like the game, don't play it. Period. No need to let the world know you're feelings are hurt about it.
[4:04:34] Notic: i love the new catch up tbh feels really good, way better than BFA ever did
[4:04:43] mavericks312: but yall were just saying blizz doesnt use old content lol
[4:04:47] Riszyn: There's a lot of excuses made for a billion dollar company that just hasn't put focus where it needs to go >_>
[4:04:50] ZibzRO: but all aside i do love 9.2 the new map is so gorgeous
[4:04:52] Snabido: Castle Nathria is old Sadge
[4:04:56] Snabido: 😏
[4:04:57] flickrmbskull: well that's because he goes off the internet and isn't kept up with wth really happening and probably doesn't have a 60 probably got list of lvl 8-35 and just mauling 🙈
[4:05:00] Molvonos: I'm kinda excited to do the S1/S2 raids with the affixes
[4:05:02] Broomba: @ditaern i think you woke up on the wrong side of bed, go back to bed and try again
[4:05:08] PopeJonas: Which old dungeons are they gonna use?
[4:05:11] Steelsky_: I'm super excited for s4 tbh
[4:05:12] mmrghost7: resuing old content is gonna back fire
[4:05:15] Kinghorn: happy to go back to CN
[4:05:22] warrenny: @riszyn Are you just looking fir an excuse to whine
[4:05:22] rohdey: stone legion w/ first sigil

[4:05:48] WoWsallyTV: @ARMS_WARRlOR gonna suck ass in m+
[4:05:53] manmower: i voted for the dungeons that sounded most tedious
[4:05:59] Gutroan: Isnt prot pally S tier tank right now?
[4:06:00] WOOPsWOOP: deadmines Kreygasm
[4:06:02] jerexify: @Towelliee Listen, man, I don't know WoD dungeons, and people told me to vote for GRD. It's not my fault... lol
[4:06:03] goboplaysgames: i started a prot pally last week, lvl 52
[4:06:04] ZibzRO: If those will work well i do hope they will pull an ESO or GW2... EVERY DUNGEON will be valuable!
[4:06:05] Riszyn: @warrenny No I just don't see the point in trying to defend a company that has had the same issues plaguing it for over a decade and they still aren't fixing it lol.
[4:06:06] swordart2022: @riszyn You can play different mmorpg there are many to choose from!
[4:06:09] enux337: hard working tank
[4:06:10] Rexialiton: I think those who say, that old content is no good is bs
[4:06:10] SiXKiNG_: I think I would have taken Skyreach over Depot
[4:06:11] Snabido: Would you have to clear the area with the vehicle bombs for the %?
[4:06:13] skymercii: DOCKS are CouldYouNot
[4:06:27] manmower: i wanted the dungeon on the train

[4:06:47] ZibzRO: there are like 40's dungeons in game we only use 10 at most... i do hope they will open all of them
[4:06:55] Riszyn: okay okay, the tribalism is coming out and there's no reasoning with it, drop it lol
[4:06:58] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Iron Docks is linear, thats why its good, Everbloom is crap so im glad that didnt make it
[4:06:59] ExpectDragons: Mythic+ Deadmines
[4:07:14] skymercii: Auchindoun is the bestWoD dungeon and i will die on this hill

[4:07:14] reggiepowa: they shouldnt be asking community which dungeons to bring to m+, grimrail will be terrible

[4:09:49] HaloS23: @mavericks312 Bold moves there Cotton!! I hope your right!!
[4:09:50] ZibzRO: TBH Dragonflight cinematic was very low.... by blizz standards tbh if you compare it with WoD one or even MoP or Legion... but man i cant wait to go to the dragons and hunt them down, finally will take full advantage of my dragonslayer title :P

[4:18:12] swordart2022: They should not nerf gear from pvp and many would do it :P
[4:18:25] swordart2022: Mounted
[4:18:30] CianoHD3: stay on mount and they wont pulll
[4:18:31] sideburns_20: you have to be mounted and your pet wont pull when it runs past the pillar
[4:18:47] CianoHD3: yes

[4:18:52] vidgalves: logics
[4:18:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: not be in combat
[4:19:13] propwash80: @Towelliee do you have the link to that video of the 4d theater? i've been looking for it but cant find it
[4:19:18] CianoHD3: it puts the pet into forced passive you cant get your pet to attack when mounted
[4:19:33] Milanesa_De_Pollo: it only pulls if you get in combat
[4:19:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: That makes sense, that the pet aggro radius drops when you're mounted
[4:20:28] Snabido: Just imagine your pets also jumps on your mount, but the game engine is limited to show it 😏

[4:25:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: Hunter's misdirect used to be really important, I loved it when people were good at using that on the tank

[4:26:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: THey definitely have a higher skillcap to use all their tools with traps and all
[4:27:08] Connectus: How's survival btw, is it fun to play ?
[4:27:08] jpwastaken_: @wEiRdO_dUdE still use it every single pull i have it up, classes do so much damage it's hard for tanks to play without MD especially if u play surv and maybe have a lock in the group too
[4:27:32] Molvonos: You can't do some chunky M+ pulls without MD/Tricks.
[4:27:38] Phalian01: already level 60🤭

[4:30:10] Phalian01: never played Hunter. always prot pala
[4:30:11] Rexialiton: its still weird to see Surv being melee
[4:30:17] jpwastaken_: the bomb resets man hahahaha, you gotta stop using all ur bombs, ur getting a red bomb and getting resets but u cant use them for 10 seconds almost
[4:30:24] Rexialiton: @ARMS_WARRlOR nah
[4:30:31] Phalian01: @rexialiton yeah realy strange
[4:30:56] jpwastaken_: you can feign death when he's casting it on you to make him choose someone else
[4:31:16] MILESkg21: Jebaited him with the Feign LuL
[4:31:16] jpwastaken_: @Towelliee you can disengage out of it when you play posthaste, you're playing binding shot
[4:31:46] tetrahydridodinitrogen: @jpwastaken_ this is why no one likes hunters

[4:38:56] SpoofAvatar: did you get a crafted 262?

[4:46:00] Phil87z: People who want it really want it. Most people probably don’t care
[4:46:00] stoop_kid69: i hate that housing phases you away from people. even if not directly interacting with other players, i still want to see them around in the game
[4:46:03] Aidler: they should give us a mobile home as a first step… lol
[4:46:06] EllisTheMenace1: cant we just get wild Starr back ??!
[4:46:09] tronbadgames: the only way people will like player housing is if it has something they like.. lol great take
[4:46:09] Mazerbeam: There is a MMO coming out that's whole premise is housing. Clearly a market for it

[4:46:34] EllisTheMenace1: cant we just get wild Starr back ??! plz ...
[4:46:36] PraxicThorn: I couldn't care less about housing tbh LUL
[4:46:38] Fugazi811: ok so theme fits archaeology

[4:46:41] finksburg: wasnt that WoD?
[4:46:41] Xilyane: It doesnt have to be but yes, they would wanna do that.
[4:46:44] warrenny: @manmower Afterlife

[4:46:56] Nerendis: NUMBER 1 PALLY IN THE WOLRD ATHENEE
[4:47:14] Zerfell: it doesnt have to be all at once, just start small with housing and build it up over time
[4:47:15] tetrahydridodinitrogen: expansion centered around the housing market crash in aseroth
[4:47:16] Urebaldd: LUL
[4:47:18] JoshStrobl: They should have done it with Shadowlands and had houses for each covenant that you could earn, styled in each Covenant's zone style.
[4:47:20] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee thats the one!!
[4:47:21] Xilyane: @PraxicThorn Yea well a lot of people would like it if it was done right. And you just wouldnt have to participate

[5:52:48] GamerKillance: Ya Microsoft caught up this generation. It was MUUUUUUUUUUUCH lower than that for the xbox one

[7:12:41] Ascendor81: I just did the 6month sub for the free mount, looks awesome, then i just cancel, and wait for new mount :)
[7:12:44] sifer007: they want there fix
[7:12:51] Ascendor81: i go month to month
[7:12:53] Kisswani: that's because WoW's strong points is taken for granted , so the complaints are more prevalent . While when you play other MMOs you focus on what the MMO does best
[7:13:14] adxx: I personally just miss lore and stories of OG Warcraft. Shadowlands was way out there for me lore wise. Almost no care for the narrative
[7:13:23] 3663Sharad: Gesundheit and happy covid KEKW
[7:13:25] GunBunz: is frost better than fire right now?
[7:13:49] kamikazis: code brown!!!
[7:13:52] ZAVHALLA: I think a new game has to look at competitors and take everything that work  and find a way to integrate them competently in their game.
[7:14:03] kamikazis: towLets towGo towWipe
[7:15:07] manmower: it's tough to compete against WoW's combat

[7:19:06] BelllGoR: boomer take
[7:19:07] kashug: Pushing your own key is the easiest way to get into high keys as a low-geared low-rating player. Perfect for a 9-5 experience :D
[7:19:13] manmower: we want old school, playing our MMO on vinyl
[7:19:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: It ruins the immersion of being a pain in the ass LUL
[7:19:18] Strange_Inquiries: LUL
[7:19:22] ZAVHALLA: Wow IS the best BASE mmo tbh, everything that it does, it does well, it just need to incorporate features from other games (in a good fashion, ofc). FFXIV, GW2, ESO all got great features, but lack the basic stuff WoW simply does best.
[7:19:23] swordart2022: LUL
[7:19:24] 3663Sharad: Sounds like New World KEKW
[7:19:25] Ascendor81: us 30-40 year olds know better
[7:19:28] OGXanos: DF is fine it just needs to be realm restricted like it was in Wrath
[7:19:44] manmower: New World combat actually has something going for it
[7:19:48] Menion01: And then on the flip side they aren't having one in Wrath.

[7:44:38] dreamwalker213: Leaving a 9 LUL
[7:44:46] manmower: he was just going out for some smokes
[7:44:47] Just_Jack13: So cringe lmao
[7:44:51] gritbarontv: lol
[7:44:53] stallowned: LUL
[7:44:53] theSalute: lul
[7:44:59] icculus: jaja
[7:45:02] DrakeDuude: TRUE SO TRUE
[7:45:02] saltyohm: KEKW
[7:45:25] nightmayor12: JAJA
[7:45:32] Kisswani: WF ragnaros leaver Kappa
[7:45:33] Korupcija_: hope he gets a 6 month ban!
[7:45:53] TheItalianStallion321: now you see what WE go thru lol
[7:45:55] MisterD1rty: I had a ragnaros player leave after killing all the slimes on PF in bursting
[7:45:57] mackieftw: 🤏
[7:45:59] alwayspresto: If i see someone from rag thats a insta decline
[7:46:01] zgag: Maybe he knew that he was being outclassed by Chadbomb .
[7:46:03] Phil87z: Pug life
[7:46:09] Ryntero: Rag players made me quit the game
[7:46:14] zgag: p
[7:46:15] UndecidedPotate: This is my life
[7:46:15] Aegrial: keys under 10 are a shit show.
[7:46:17] darthvapor420: most ppl are such fucking pussioes
[7:46:20] valianya: If you don't stay feign deathed until you're out of combat, then you still have aggro when you pop up immediately.  You have to also command pet to play dead or it stays in combat
[7:46:24] icculus: Tbf that healer was str8 up not healing you
[7:46:26] Phil87z: How many did you compete
[7:46:28] Sollice: It's hard out there on those streets
[7:46:30] 91Niki: Welcome to the casual life, enjoy your stay LUL
[7:46:45] Aaradin: yeah thats how it is, people are either really good or really bad
[7:46:46] Shirey36: push your own key to 10
[7:46:47] Just_Jack13: 10s are easier with Encypted anyways
[7:46:50] soysos91: hard life out there

[7:46:51] MeisterPetze: try it
[7:47:01] zgag: If you got  4 piece a   +10 ill be easy to get into
[7:47:11] nightmayor12: you pet has to feign also
[7:47:16] ArcaneSyntax: keys over 10 are also a shitshow
[7:47:17] jkitchin75: its your pet
[7:47:20] darthvapor420: yeupcock
[7:47:21] adxx: There should be a “leave penalty record” on accounts that constantly quit mid key. It fucks the key holder and other games like OW have this in place for ranked mode
[7:47:33] Aaradin: going in and out of combat in wow has always been weird too
[7:47:33] DMRCEM: spitefull hits you in FD
[7:48:01] toobaked1987: Towelliee Kyrian Mythic + tanking as a paladin is almost as fun as dwilight devistation. What a blast!
[7:48:14] assman_ny: Don't even Que for shit if your already a powder keg going in
[7:48:22] MisterD1rty: Yea it’s not the game it’s the people that make it hard to play wow
[7:48:26] GGWalshy: A lot of the times when im holding down my right click and I feign death, it doesnt work.
[7:48:32] manmower: we call people from ragnaros quitters, they laugh at us "look at this key staying noob"
[7:48:43] Sollice: Was he MDing?
[7:48:44] toobaked1987: Learn2Misdirect
[7:48:47] Sollice: If not he was a shit hunter
[7:48:53] icculus: Both times you came back from death you got no heals
[7:48:59] Aegrial: since people got their 4 pc, its a huge problem.
[7:49:15] fabiomcv: people forget that fun isn't always just about winning everytime, just play and have ffun, relax bro
[7:49:20] Shirey36: dps haviung a 4pc in a low key and tank not is near impossible
[7:49:50] MisterD1rty: As enhance shaman you can be bottom dps and still rip threat off a tank. Been a problem since 9.0
[7:49:52] valianya: The play dead mechanic for pets is garbage.  It was added in BfA.  Before, the pet auto played dead.  Now there's a long cooldown after you command play dead before you can wake it.  Its garbage the wake up shares cooldown with play dead.  Faster to dismiss and resummon than wait for wake up
[7:50:26] JediNeo99999: @Shirey36 Not really. Just because catalyst is out people still need flux and an item to convert. It can take some time depending how much they play
[7:50:51] adxx: It would be nice to have some system in place for leavers. Puglife like me lose a lot of time doing a dungeon halfway and then one wipe causing a leaver. Sucks for KSM as a solo player
[7:51:06] the_bad_goat: How much game time do you have left at ole chaddy?
[7:51:11] Arms_Warrior: its another button
[7:51:19] Arms_Warrior: play dead
[7:51:23] tetrahydridodinitrogen: you have to macro it for it to work well
[7:51:25] Bayne77: play dead?
[7:51:29] valianya: They changed it in BfA
[7:51:40] valianya: Its garbage
[7:51:47] LucaLeucos: HeyGuys
[7:51:58] Celestia6: You can also dismiss your pet and then feign
[7:52:03] darthvapor420: yeah i have no idea how to deal with it
[7:52:16] Kisswani: I just think the whole Key system is outdated . just have a drop down menu and choose what + you need to do
[7:52:16] kamikazis: you get teh tome for "play dead" in legion class hall
[7:52:21] NichosGaming: !9TO5

[7:52:23] valianya: You have to wait like 20 seconds before you can wake up your pet
[7:52:23] fabiomcv: just make it show, how often has this person left before
[7:52:27] MadCowScurge: just no loot till the end
[7:52:33] manmower: it should just show a 'dungeon leave' number on your char sheet
[7:52:33] MrGharr: 'Vote to leave?"
[7:52:38] bigcountry555: make a vote to leave so that way you have to communicate with the group. dunno if that would work
[7:52:41] LucaLeucos: Hope you are all well <3
[7:52:54] the_bad_goat: No like for the week
[7:52:55] RasmusAdrian22: they should add ome sort of player history, how many runs they have leaved in the past
[7:52:59] Slitze: back in the good ole' days they used to haha
[7:53:04] DubakuMatumbo: @Towelliee I do asmonBoy
[7:53:07] kamikazis: lol that rant would be an awesome sub notifier
[7:53:09] TheItalianStallion321: even if you cuss out the group before you leave, reporting wont do anything anyway
[7:53:12] manmower: he would have typed
[7:53:16] JediNeo99999: What if people get a string of bad keys that weren't going to finish? Should they spend hour+ failing at a key to avoid a penalty
[7:53:16] Shirey36: devils advocate...at what point have you stayed in a fail key long enough before it would be okay to stop wasting your time and leave
[7:53:24] darthvapor420: again etiquette matters
[7:53:26] YOLO__SWAG__420: why is hunter melee now?
[7:53:26] Bayne77: mom was calling them to the table
[7:53:32] Arms_Warrior: if u have somewhere to be u dont enter the dungeon
[7:53:36] Korupcija_: can we get that guy on discord and have an interview?
[7:53:40] Chris7013: Still, as a hunter, all he had to do was misdirect on to the tank and then he’s fine
[7:53:44] darthvapor420: agreed
[7:53:48] dreamwalker213: Also, what if the group as a whole decides to brick the key how would the game know and not give a penalty ya know
[7:53:48] darthvapor420: sadge
[7:53:57] 91Niki: I mean I have done that. A group that keeps wiping to the same shit, cuz nobody is doing mechanics. I'll call them idiots under my own breath and then leave LUL
[7:54:04] kamikazis: feign death... aggroe lost...done
[7:54:09] nightmayor12: We need character background checks in game plz
[7:54:11] Hybridwarhawk: towBook
[7:54:12] shadow2step: a deserter time out would be nice though
[7:54:17] JediNeo99999: There are valid reasons to leave keys sometimes too
[7:54:17] Arms_Warrior: towelliees black book got u
[7:54:23] Phil87z: I don’t think keys should lose a level of you fail. It won’t be as toxic
[7:54:24] Kisswani: you black book should be a public record Kappa
[7:54:30] the_bad_goat: I remember that time I was healing one of your 15 keys in legion and my toddler came around the corner with shit all over his hands and Easter clothes. I still didn’t leave and timed your key
[7:54:34] MrIAmTrundle: imjust assume all rag player will leave
[7:54:34] bigcountry555: LUL this would be like a wow episode of undercover boss
