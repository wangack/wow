[0:33:03] vibesham: Decoy totem and spirit of the alpha
[0:33:05] TheEyeVII: or in
[0:33:12] NotASkiller: beansR
[0:33:25] ninth3: tank rune

[0:33:38] vibesham: last for 30 min
[0:33:57] IMasturnate: first time chatter
[0:34:00] vibesham: Yeah.. The decoy totem is the fun one
[0:34:10] eepshays: yo @cdewx you remember the name of the good water for retail arena?
[0:34:19] vibesham: It's insane vs mages
[0:34:23] vibesham: They have no shot

[0:34:50] jasonkbkt: That's mee
[0:34:54] zachgamegodx: shaman exclusive baby
[0:34:58] NotASkiller: have you ever asked your wife to cook a food from WoW? LUL
[0:35:17] vibesham: it's the 100 parse buff
[0:35:25] vibesham: KEKW
[0:35:33] zachgamegodx: the wow cook book is apparently fun
[0:35:40] zachgamegodx: I’m terrible at baking tho
[0:35:52] braiven_: brooo my boy is playing SoD
[0:35:53] toxicplays_tv: I have it. It's really fun
[0:36:00] Shablagoosh: its definitely cooler as a novelty item than actually using it from what ive heard lol
[0:36:00] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:36:31] Mano_14: dewYo
[0:37:25] NotASkiller: Not getting mob tagged? streamer bennies r deadge
[0:37:36] Shablagoosh: you could probably get into beans shameless gnomer tomorrow night if you want
[0:37:40] Shablagoosh: he gonna take all loot tho
[0:37:41] tiki93: dude your getting sick a lot I guess I don’t know cause I don’t have kids.
[0:37:44] Tepre: why is sod level 40 not as hype?
[0:38:35] braiven_: I really love the concept of SoD
[0:38:37] TheEyeVII: it's the same as any 2nd season  on retail, pop dips big time after the first month, not different with sod
[0:38:39] synzebru: could easily get multiple 25s fast, alts are hype. it's rough to do that with 40
[0:38:44] zachgamegodx: I think at 60 enhance will be really fun with the 2h rune but depends
[0:38:51] wowsuomi: It was newer but tbh a lot of ppl  still like p2
[0:39:01] vibesham: There's also the fact that it's the same gameplay loop as 25
[0:39:06] Shablagoosh: i think they did a lot more polishing on phase 1 for the release and phase 2 was more rushed
[0:39:10] vibesham: you do gnomer and event and thats it
[0:39:11] JD_Yadig: it was a big mistake progressing classic all the way to cata like where does it end
[0:39:19] zachgamegodx: if it’s just auto attacking that’ll get old fast… can you do maelstrom abilities at the same rate as DE
[0:39:20] zachgamegodx: DW
[0:39:23] JD_Yadig: 5 versions of the game
[0:40:09] vibesham: @zachgamegodx At the moment no
[0:40:12] Jplague21: I don't care how many versions of the game there are. I care that I get to play the game when it was the most fun
[0:40:39] ckdranger375: There's no official hardcore sod mode right?
[0:40:41] TheEyeVII: p2 wasn't rushed at all, it's just the natural pop dip after a launch & might be some classic-fatigue going on for some
[0:40:43] Shablagoosh: not gonna lie id fuck up some bfa classic with corruption
[0:41:04] Shablagoosh: ineffable truth hpal
[0:41:04] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1

[0:41:09] vibesham: LETS DO VISIONS
[0:41:11] vibesham: LUL
[0:41:15] colbyjackedup: retail would be even more dead without classic release
[0:41:19] Shablagoosh: it might ruin all of our memories of mop
[0:41:40] jasonkbkt: I don't think you could kill that was
[0:42:04] braiven_: community in classic/SoD is solid
[0:42:19] tiki93: I don’t think so I love thinking going to blizzcon and watching him play when ven told the other team he was playing monk on stage
[0:42:25] Shablagoosh: looks like hes stalking you or something
[0:42:26] Jplague21: Classic MoP is definitely going to be different from when MoP was retail. For one, the player base is a lot more skilled
[0:42:27] spennyde: what server?
[0:42:28] Shablagoosh: maybe hes a viewer
[0:42:39] jasonkbkt: It's me you prick
[0:42:39] Whitewolf1441: sounding a bit sick cdew
[0:42:40] NotASkiller: can't believe Trill would mob tag another streamer and not his own TL boy. 👀

[4:50:07] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx Well inflation won't help w/ this. If every1 goes up say +200, you will just be 2800 w/ no Qs. We need more players
[4:50:19] shaayynee: Blizzard dont really care too much about tuning with war within coming later this year is the problem
[4:50:21] ripinpeace10: we just want mop back mop was good cuz everything was overpowered @cdewx
[4:50:26] saren8: I want the rock paper scissors to be back. Like WW counters arms, but arms counters rogues, but rogues counter WW
[4:50:28] saren8: Things like that
[4:50:30] ripinpeace10: luckily mop classic in a couple years
[4:50:37] Proffzx: solos have also negatively impacted ladder ques, they are slowly dividing playerbase, between classic, sod, retail, 3s and solos, the player base is getting insanely small. every season thats had inflation where r1 is 3100+ has been the most participated seasons, people enjoy getting rating in 3s. it brings in more casuals
[4:50:49] redskinlgnd: ret warrrior slands?
[4:50:58] redskinlgnd: I didn't feel that way at all LUL
[4:51:04] oscrtv: I dont want the meta to be around mana and zugzug gameplay, its so boring
[4:51:05] deanoxs: there is no reason to bring a different melee atm than rogue or dh right
[4:51:36] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx Also population goes down as the expansion gets older. Can't control that
[4:51:37] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[4:51:57] odikwow: the game is hard when dk is good
[4:52:09] Proffzx: @MaybeRespect s3 of SL was the highest player base in years.
[4:52:14] Proffzx: thats not true at all
[4:52:27] al_capow: I can come help with rune
[4:52:29] al_capow: im in badlands rn
[4:52:39] redskinlgnd: I feel that when rets are op the game feels the worst
[4:52:57] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx Generally, it is true. Your not wrong about S3 though, but then S4 was deadge
[4:53:04] voxralol: @Proffzx agree entirely. shuffle has ruined ladder q's when ppl who couldn't break rival before are getting their "elite" titles in solo shuffle and claiming 2.4+ exp
[4:53:08] Meadamemnon: i play shaman, when rogues are OP the game feels the worst
[4:53:09] Grizz_VX: @redskinlgnd arently hardly ever OP?
[4:53:19] Proffzx: because MMR was nerfed into oblivion s4, kids that were 2700 couldnt get 2100, and they quit.
[4:53:25] Grizz_VX: arent they hardly ever OP?*
[4:53:53] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx Yeah people want rewards now. I think a long term fix is making the gameplay fun/less barrier to entry
[4:54:01] peeves123: You should get checked for pneumonia @cdewx
[4:54:07] Proffzx: its statistically proven mmr inflation increases bracket play, plenty of data hard pulls on it. you have people queing for mogs, people queing for glad mounts, and people trying to push for 2700 achieves, or 1. the ladder is much more alive. it statistically cant be argued.
[4:54:13] saren8: have you tried like, cough drops  or losenges?
[4:54:22] Grizz_VX: @MaybeRespect agreed arent they talking xbox port for some odd reason?
[4:54:40] Meadamemnon: only way they have less barrier to entry is by nerfing addons, specifically WA in PvP @MaybeRespect
[4:54:54] MaybeRespect: @Meadamemnon That's a big start for sure.
[4:55:06] Proffzx: remove solos, add inflation, game will come back alive.
[4:55:21] Proffzx: now they are coming out with solo rbgs, to divide the player base, again.
[4:55:22] Dotntrot: what healer needs buffs
[4:55:27] Meadamemnon: they cant remove it now that they have added it in
[4:55:32] saren8: solos are more popular than 3s atm though
[4:55:32] oscrtv: nah I honestly think only way to "bring back" wow is to release wow2
[4:55:33] ripinpeace10: solo shuffle sucks
[4:55:38] odikwow: solos way better for the game
[4:55:38] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx Addons, bloat, homogenization are the bigger issues.
[4:55:44] odikwow: addons are bad for the game
[4:55:48] voxralol: keep solos. just remove the ability to get titles/achievements from it. attempting to find partners for 3s claiming 2.4/2.6/2.8 exp who don't understand basic arena mechanics is annoying
[4:56:01] kakichoco: they should change verdant embrace.. it is so dumb even in pve
[4:56:03] Meadamemnon: solo que has killed so many MMORPG pvp modes
[4:56:14] voxralol: "im 2.6 in shuffle" oh. so you're 1800 3s exp gotcha
[4:56:23] MaybeRespect: LOL. His cave!
[4:56:24] oscrtv: thats generous
[4:56:26] Proffzx: its not that solos themselves are bad, but they add another divisions of playerbase
[4:56:29] Triangulum: LUL
[4:56:30] Owlcopwn: lol?
[4:56:38] shaayynee: Mines prob idk
[4:56:38] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[4:56:40] Triangulum: asmongold?
[4:56:47] Proffzx: currently you have solo Ques, 3 ques, RBG ques, classic, SOD
[4:56:47] cokezer0o: yo did wow get you rich ?
[4:56:48] Triangulum: in his natural habitat
[4:56:50] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx Just odd that's your prio change suggestion :p
[4:56:52] Proffzx: and now you are adding solo rbgs
[4:56:57] odikwow: hating on solo que pvp in wow is crazy
[4:57:04] saren8: I know Solo is a lower skill ceiling than 3s, but I have to say I LOVE not playing into RMP / RMD / RMS as a casual
[4:57:38] Triangulum: solo queue is fun, like what you're meant to be doing when playing a game
[4:57:52] Proffzx: i mean its insane to think nerfing addons helps anything. addons assist everyone using them, theres a reason theers nearly 0 pros who still dont use addons now that they are allowed.
[4:58:24] Proffzx: solo q has also accounted for 25% of pvp player base bans, another crazy data pull
[4:58:30] voxralol: the gap between being 2.6 in shuffle and 2.6 3s exp is absurdly broad. thats the issue. when i say i'm 2.7/glad exp, that means 3s. when i find ppl in LFG that claim said exp but from shuffle, they typically have no clue how to actually play the game
[4:58:43] MaybeRespect: Addons are a huge factor when it comes to barrier to entry, which impacts population (what your complaining about).
[4:58:48] saren8: @Proffzx Bans for what?
[4:58:52] ripinpeace10: bbwslayer lol
[4:59:32] Proffzx: @saren8 people report people for telling someone they are bad, or how to play, or just pain because they lose, and wow added in a perma ban feature for reports
[4:59:56] Proffzx: and its not that many, i cant remember who it was, but a streamer had people report his lvl 1 and he was banned in like 20 minutes
[5:00:20] odikwow: reporting players for being bad is cringe
[5:00:20] MaybeRespect: @Proffzx where did you get this 25% from
[5:00:22] Proffzx: and now that people know that, they spam report in solos, someone makes a bad play, report, someone dies without a cd, report
[5:00:39] odikwow: im gonna go jack off on the toilet
[5:00:40] Proffzx: @MaybeRespect theres data pulls of this all over reddit,
[5:01:05] MaybeRespect: Lol ight.
[5:01:16] Proffzx: tbh, as soon as wow went "woke" and removed stupid things like /spit, game plummeted haha
[5:01:59] blightclub: hard agree

[5:02:07] iiiidan1994: i swear ur hair was good or ur wife made u change
[5:02:09] Proffzx: big facts
[5:02:16] aant02: I liked being spit on tho Sadge
[5:02:19] vjsnakefarm: game so soft
[5:02:20] Triangulum: I hope they make an addon / macro to spit on people
[5:02:23] blightclub: The new social contract has resulted in a few weeks of ban time for yours truly
[5:02:24] odikwow: game tuning was so trash from that removal of /spit
[5:02:25] Proffzx: i guess my sarcasm wasnt thick enough @cdewx
[5:02:25] Jaybeezy: GGS
[5:02:28] Triangulum: cause it's literally unplayable
[5:02:31] MaybeRespect: I, somewhat agree. People get banned for the dumbest things now
[5:02:31] accessdenn: undead rogue called stabx with spit macro was the OG meta
[5:02:56] cokezer0o: being a dh takes tremdous skill kid
[5:03:02] MaybeRespect: My buddy got banned after going 0-6 in shuffle because all 5 people reported him. And bliz has AI auto response to tickets
[5:03:18] urack: @cdewx really mes and trill are telling you, main dh, how to play dh? Pfff Kappa
[5:03:18] odikwow: nobody can deny playing DH in a 3k lobby is NOT easy
[5:04:10] Proffzx: @MaybeRespect and you cannot apeal bans, its wild
[5:04:26] ilikegoldfishes: cough so bad I feel like im gonna get sick just watching the stream
[5:04:29] odikwow: good luck appealing the N wor
