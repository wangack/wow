[5:47:02] khemz1: All im saying is, throw in a meme affix combo on an 18 at some point, and we might see some diversity :) Plus if teams have 1 map where 4 dps might be preferable, it might affect their comp for the other maps

[5:59:47] Telomir: @amandauh in any competitive environment (esp time based), a converging meta will always arise with 1 to n teams, based on content design. Based on the nature of BfA dungeons, its not surprising that the existing meta exists (these 2 teams - the WW or DK variant) - its just how it is. Might see more with engineering rez, but due to restrictions, Rdruid is optimal, TC prot warrior is essentially a quasi 4th dps and tank built into one.. and the utility of rogues (esp shroud) is unbeatable.

[7:05:17] NateYoungTV: @Fire090 if accompany wins, yes
[7:05:19] ShikaDub: i thought she had the witch variant
[7:05:44] SockFullofQuarters: the 21 deaths are for RNG manipulation, right? not that kind of speedrun you say?
[7:05:44] VecosTV: dopnt they need 83% going down? they have only 81%

[7:05:49] Fire090: @protomanmm2 ty
[7:05:52] Miketron: @shirox11 this would happen in any PvE competition, it could seem boring to the casual player but it's actually exciting to watch from a competitive perspective
[7:05:55] ShikaDub: Skyline's alma looked different then accompany's
[7:05:56] kurisuwow: isnt 21 deaths much for such teams? XD
[7:05:59] ShikaDub: wot
[7:06:02] f1ragment: Where is the reaping?
[7:06:17] f1ragment: where is the 4th reaping?
[7:06:17] spark1ez25: chinese version probably
[7:06:17] ShikaDub: shadowmeld
[7:06:20] ShikaDub: de aggros them
[7:06:20] VecosTV: 21 death in +18 when like +25 is worlds highest
[7:06:22] CrassusHeroes: @VecosTV you can skip the last reaping by doing the bosses first and then fill up to 100%
[7:06:22] blogchamp: no 21 deaths is normal :)
[7:06:25] f1ragment: accompany?
[7:06:27] Super_LSM: OMEGALUL

[7:06:35] ShikaDub: I forgot about that
[7:06:36] Rogastik: @shirox11 while I agree M+ balance is pretty bad atm even for regular players. Its impossible to balance the game so perfectly where in competitive environment you won't see same comp everywhere. These teams will use best comp even if its only 3% better than next best thing.
