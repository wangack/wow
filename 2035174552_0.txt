[1:10:00] mdavilla: you should see it, i quited sod because of that, and 100g a green item
[1:10:03] kimao: never had that on my server, people just ask for logs to prove they have the experience they say
[1:10:43] sfeeraa: its builder/spender mechanic for priest
[1:10:45] UMRIz: no its "class power" like holypower
[1:11:16] ninzelol: @Prefoxfox gonna boost 3 warriors and play only warr/mage in cata
[1:12:08] ninzelol: affli in unplayable
[1:12:11] ninzelol: what can i do
[1:12:25] ninzelol: need a 2nd main class after mage
[1:12:26] Papabless_KEKW: @kimao tbf i havent pugged at all in SoD
[1:12:37] Papabless_KEKW: we just do main raid into several alt raids same night
[1:12:48] kimao: Papabless_KEKW I pugged some on my alts
[1:12:51] Creoxx: @ninzelol isnt afli really good in cata?
[1:13:07] kimao: because most of the people I play with only have 2-3 characters
[1:13:09] kimao: and I have 4
[1:13:23] ninzelol: no
[1:13:27] ninzelol: its so bad
[1:13:29] ninzelol: like
[1:13:35] shlajfer: that is mop
[1:13:37] ninzelol: literally demo is the only viable spec
[1:13:41] ninzelol: i am tlaking cata
[1:13:44] KenjinTV: He said mop 50 times
[1:13:50] Papabless_KEKW: @kimao have 4 and we do 4 KEKL
[1:15:00] kimao: Papabless_KEKW :)
[1:15:33] kimao: We usually do 3 per night
[1:15:41] Papabless_KEKW: we have 2 runs going at same time thats mains, and then 2 now 3 alt runs with whatever people have
[1:17:22] kimao: Papabless_KEKW prepared for whatever the future gonna bring then :)
[1:18:03] Papabless_KEKW: @kimao i want 25 man raids :)
[1:19:17] kimao: Papabless_KEKW doubt that will happen before 60 though
[1:19:21] kimao: More like with 20man
[1:19:25] kimao: likely*
[1:19:41] kimao: 20man SM at 50
[1:20:26] Creoxx: GigaOwl
[1:21:19] Jaydeentv: 20 man bfd
[1:21:25] Jaydeentv: brd*
[1:21:28] kimao: 1 20man 1 10man at 50, and then no idea about 60
[1:21:50] Papabless_KEKW: 40 man is just so boring
[1:21:55] DjUrsu: SM with final boss turning into a dragon upon dying and having Halion cutters
[1:22:02] kimao: Only way they do 40man on 60 is completely new raids I think
[1:22:06] Jaydeentv: just go 20 and dispers Pog
[1:22:19] kimao: Otherwise it will just be the same old "buff all mobs, and bosses X%"
[1:22:53] AquaYoo: you can go up to 50 stacks and disperse it
[1:23:23] Papabless_KEKW: @kimao also anything after 25 man is just take whatever is broken x15

[6:04:15] Nightbot: I wanna say that I had enough. YOur MOD banned me again for no reasson @pokeypointy. I was thinking to suscribe but when someone is overusing power and bann me for no reasson. Sayin that Raid lider have no idea how first cutter work and we see on second wipe and almost on 3th that I was right. So I am out, it was fun to watch you but I dont wanna be part of this chat until this @pokeypointy is here. To you @pokeypointy go f yourself. I hope we never see each other.
