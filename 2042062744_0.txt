[4:14:25] floodinz: yea
[4:14:33] pdfourtwenty: but it was changed to Your Lava Surge talent also makes Lava Burst instant when it triggers.

[7:59:25] Alkisfadern: !roll Here are two concise tips for Prefoxfox to avoid dying to Defile on Heroic Lich King:  Spread Out Strategically:  Ensure the raid is spread out effectively to cover more ground during Defile. This reduces the risk of overlapping and provides ample space for safe movement. Constant Movement:  Stay on the move during Defile. Avoid standing still to decrease the chances of being caught in the expanding area. Use movement abilities wisely to reposition quickly.

[9:35:54] shanu91: is that near katherini
[9:35:56] shanu91: or thassos

[9:37:08] athania01: you stayed in katerini or in paralia?
[9:37:15] shanu91: since it's a lot cheaper than romania
[9:37:19] shanu91: in katerini
[9:37:37] athania01: paralia is the tourist place, katerini is 8km from the beach
[9:37:39] shanu91: some hotel at the side of the highway
[9:37:52] athania01: ah you stayed in the love hotel Pooga

[9:39:09] Cras123: it's relative I guess
[9:39:30] athania01: in paralia they have special prices for romanians, bulgarians, serbs and rest of the balkans
[9:39:41] athania01: like 15 euro per day for rooms etc
[9:39:46] bakergostars: Gamba points incorrectly applied, rip ldl bucks
[9:40:01] athania01: but paralia sucks dick, the sea is yikes

[9:40:09] aronfolmer: xff
[9:40:15] shanu91: like a day at the beach - sunbed, some drinks, and food is AT LEAST 40-50 eur in Romania if you go not very expensive places
[9:40:23] shanu91: in greece you can do a day at the beach with 10-15 eur
[9:40:36] athania01: well in most places in greece you dont pay the sunbed

[10:09:13] shanu91: they game way harder than me
[10:09:18] Cras123: yeah but how fast do you really have to be, you're already blocked by gcd
[10:09:33] Cras123: also when you're 30+ you probably have a normal job
[10:09:39] Cras123: and no time for 6 splits every week
[10:09:50] Cras123: so you get less "practice"

[10:10:19] Cras123: doesn't mean you'd be better (than others) with the practice though
[10:10:38] shanu91: true but how could i compete with andersen or anfall if i only played enha twice a week
[10:10:41] Cras123: I just played ret splits and main disc forever so
[10:10:53] shanu91: I feel I did alright but i never pushed top overalls for enha
