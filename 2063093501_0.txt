[2:04:38] Ryso33: oh boy
[2:04:40] sunsetjaxon: its an arms race- Blizzard comments on macro auto cheating
[2:04:58] shad3dspectr3: I got kicked all night before I could even cancel so
[2:05:02] sunsetjaxon: Venruki!
[2:05:17] BBRodriguez86: its just a vid of wizk sniping that totem
[2:05:35] yum_nachos: this mf
[2:05:36] cantfindthebox: I WATCHED THIS LIVE
[2:05:41] notoriousztv: guy loves mentioning the fiance
[2:05:44] i_Static: no need to mention the finance lmao
[2:05:45] Letixia: LUL
[2:05:48] inspect4: 10 sec into video and alrdy flexing about his fiance
[2:05:58] cantfindthebox: he also did a step kick
[2:06:01] notoriousztv: i watched this live
[2:06:03] notoriousztv: on vens
[2:06:10] notoriousztv: vens thought he was botting
[2:06:13] notoriousztv: ven*
[2:06:14] cantfindthebox: i was watching liive too notorious
[2:06:17] cantfindthebox: i saved the macros
[2:06:47] Zerolol123: jelly didn't show you this macro? @Pikabooirl
[2:06:54] yuiop_rob: it was reckful smurfing
[2:06:55] Ferrnius: dude the macro isnt even complext if u pause the video u can come up with it right now
[2:07:13] PineTreesz: this seems like you just macro it all together with /cast [@player] hook at the end
[2:07:18] ScoggleWoW: could have cam unlocked?
[2:07:20] cantfindthebox: #showtooltip Kick /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook
[2:07:27] deepfriedbrainforlunch: HACKERMANS
[2:07:32] Zerolol123: jelly was saying to make it @player instead of @cursor @Pikabooirl
[2:07:32] PineTreesz: this doesn't seem like cheating...

[2:07:53] Blitzylive: macros are fine
[2:07:55] R1_Prototype: ctrl v. Ctrl c
[2:07:55] i_Static: did he show his finance the macro?
[2:07:56] SwiisH_Tv: i swear content creators ruined gaming
[2:07:59] itsmistero: 1 button macros are never easier in retail wow
[2:08:03] Gore90: the fact that any of these kinds of macros work is stuid
[2:08:03] timmah25: [@player] so it returns him where he was last standing
[2:08:05] Gore90: stupid*
[2:08:08] PineTreesz: every thing is off gcd, at cursor macros are allowed... im failing to see how this is cheating
[2:08:16] averagenjoyerrrr: yikes
[2:08:20] NoChillPrims: what
[2:08:22] NoChillPrims: lol
[2:08:22] cantfindthebox: #showtooltip Kick /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Shadowstep /cast [target=focus, exists, harm, nodead] Kick /cast [@cursor] Grappling Hook.     is the macro i think
[2:08:43] Ryso33: sweet peas
[2:08:43] i_Static: open the macros page buddy
[2:09:01] sunsetjaxon: so blizzard should make it 1 button
[2:09:02] PineTreesz: yeah this isn't cheating. All allowed game mechanics....
[2:09:03] deepfriedbrainforlunch: yeah you can make insane macros atm
[2:09:05] yuiop_rob: the new awc tech
[2:09:11] drfeltgood: This fucking game is sus af god I hate it so much
[2:09:14] Woodhard: @Pikabooirl who was your favourite character from the hit television sitcom series Cheers?
[2:09:19] Blackoss: Even the cat is like this is bs
[2:09:20] heavykeyboard: i mean thats been doable with sub with 2 steps though
[2:09:24] Promocodebaj: disgusting
[2:09:44] vinwrx: i clicked pika and got pal
[2:09:50] Fourofdiamonds1: Time to use it
[2:09:56] Gore90: macros have gone way too far
[2:10:01] Cuddle_Bunz: palumor smoked me in 2s the other day. i blame the macro
[2:10:01] Gore90: macros are dumb af
[2:10:04] vinwrx: remove all of this
[2:10:05] deepfriedbrainforlunch: keep it real
[2:10:09] sunsetjaxon: zero skill gap
[2:10:09] overmancffc: should delete all macro
[2:10:09] shopkeeperyt: macros and addons need to go
[2:10:10] SwiisH_Tv: Preach
[2:10:10] deepfriedbrainforlunch: NODDERS
[2:10:18] atorob: 100% youll see trill using it lol
[2:10:19] timmah25: Dragonflight the iwin button expac
[2:10:27] Blitzylive: yeah its fine
[2:10:29] IBlackIHIawk: pika the best rogue in game is a wow boomer...welcome to the new AI age.../sarcasm
[2:10:37] Ferrnius: aye man botters are gonna be doin shit like that, only way to fight em is through these macros :))
[2:10:39] Meednes: Make sstep trigger gcd on hook
[2:10:46] Particulation: anyone who uses them should get ear wax jammed in their belly button while they are sleeping
[2:10:52] i_Static: let’s try this puppy out!
[2:11:01] vinwrx: because you need to bot LUL
[2:11:02] Promocodebaj: Jaime's wondering how tf this helps him
[2:11:03] bloodyninegamer: I have a macro to floss, brush my teeth, and turn off the lights with one button press
[2:11:06] shopkeeperyt: Addon's are the biggest problem imo
[2:11:10] Woodhard: WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME!!!
[2:11:13] sunsetjaxon: abilities and team comp will always be important
[2:11:13] overmancffc: Ban addons and macros movement
[2:11:15] ShutUpImCharging: my shadowstep kick macro does not work. Why does his work
[2:11:18] SwiisH_Tv: Need to prune macros and delete WAs from the game forsure
[2:11:24] boocraft1992: weakauras are broken too. I wish that addon stopped working
[2:11:30] vmills: this the type of shit that is going to get blizzard to put step or kick on gcd
[2:11:35] dread_kitten: this is nothing campred to the MoP Koreans
[2:11:37] lilplatotv: bro thats ridiculous wtfffff
[2:11:37] kingattw: but mage can deep frozen far away target ,why not rogue?
[2:11:43] sunsetjaxon: how do you even gut it tho
[2:11:45] notoriousztv: conditional macros definitely not fair
[2:11:46] matt_caste: I thought they patched the conditional
[2:11:47] overmancffc: chat initiate Ban addon and macro move
[2:11:52] drfeltgood: Mean while there are people getting tilted and living in a gloom because they can't climb and this sus shit is why certain people can climb.
[2:11:52] cantfindthebox: i wouldn't use it, i think it takes skill out of the game tbh
[2:11:52] shopkeeperyt: tons of players also abusing Autohotkey aswel
[2:11:53] Blitzylive: clever use of mechanics
[2:11:54] bloodyninegamer: it's cheating if you're good at WoW and Golf
[2:11:59] DrewPBallz18: they should not be able to use weak auras or macros in pvp
[2:12:01] tigerslap_ow: they would have to limit features to do that. other macros would suffer.
[2:12:06] TheeOcean: they should remove, "Exists, harm" macros AND addons from all pvp
[2:12:08] notoriousztv: cursor is fine for AoEs and gates and shit
[2:12:09] Ryso33: yea fr multiple casts n conditionals too much
[2:12:10] Ferrnius: it's using 2 nonglobals
[2:12:15] ShutUpImCharging: does step kick work at all for anyone
[2:12:21] mianerten: ayo did you see the xar was on retail today? @Pikabooirl
[2:12:21] brevillance_: @boocraft1992 why? i use it for tracking collecting items, how much honor and conq i have, time, MS/ping/fps, i have one that highlights talents that wont break the tree...like theres so many useful things its for other than just notifications
[2:12:22] portleys: i think they need to get rid of @player and @feet, annoys me when hunters get free traps
[2:12:22] Fourofdiamonds1: This Addon is probably unusable for so many people
[2:12:25] atorob: I never use stuff like that, which is why im stuck at 1400 lmfao
[2:12:27] sunsetjaxon: i tab target everything
[2:12:34] ElonDisciple: ?
[2:12:39] Woodhard: Ted Danson
[2:12:45] lasergazer3: isnt @player the same as @focus? Genuine question
[2:12:48] whiteboy1136: im so bad i literally cant play the game without addons
[2:12:50] drfeltgood: @atorob 1000%
[2:12:50] brevillance_: @PineTreesz false, IIRC @cursor macros didnt exist in vanilla
[2:12:51] poroyou: the issue is step doesnt trigger a global
[2:12:53] DrongoLightning: only people who like this shit are the ones who get it first
[2:12:57] timmah25: id be sad if @cursor macros got taken out but they need to fix shit like that
[2:12:58] notoriousztv: cursor macros are fine but this shit is fried
[2:12:59] Meednes: @cursor was added late, maybe like legion
[2:12:59] NoChillPrims: it shouldn't need to have macros like that
[2:13:00] vinwrx: i've actually used @cursor for many disc priest things
[2:13:04] heavykeyboard: low key it would be cool to have a version of the game with no addons and no macros.
[2:13:05] Bombdiggity3315: Lets get back to playing the game?
[2:13:07] cixelp: @cursor is just for reticle abilities where you don't want to click, right?
[2:13:08] zachioo: i cant imagine figuring that out
[2:13:09] realgunner77: step should be global 100%
[2:13:10] sunsetjaxon: i never used this shit
[2:13:14] inspect4: @poroyou step would be horseshit if it was on global
[2:13:15] Meednes: Definitely not vanilla
[2:13:16] poroyou: imagine playing DH without cursor macros
[2:13:16] Ferrnius: removing @cursor would be horrid for the game though, shit like spear for warrior or shadowfury are just a click quicker with it
[2:13:18] Promocodebaj: dude's mad at you cuz he gained 20 rating with this :D
[2:13:21] matt_caste: I thought they patched the conditional  󠀀
[2:13:21] danger_daft: Pika can I show you a yt short that changed my life
[2:13:22] DrewPBallz18: Not to bring the vibes down but i just wanted to say past couple of months have been shit and watching the streams and cheering yall on in AWC is my main source of joy and just wanted to say thank you
[2:13:24] sunsetjaxon: i just push tab on my mouse
[2:13:25] babusch09: Why don't you test it?
[2:13:25] matt_caste: So they don't work anymore
[2:13:26] dizzyy_oce: back in my day we used to actually play the game!
[2:13:38] vmills: bro just get rid of all macros fuck it lol
[2:13:39] poroyou: @inspect4 step doesnt have to be on GCD it triggers one after
[2:13:39] drfeltgood: Take away all this bull shit and I bet the top 100 would change.. I bet this shit came out of the EU.. fucking trash continent
[2:13:46] jay_deetv: half the reason add-ons are so prevalent is because of how insanely complicated the game has become. it’s super not fun for new players. need to simplify rotations a bit if you want more people in PvP
[2:13:47] vinwrx: 100%
[2:13:50] sunsetjaxon: oh for sure pike those other pros using it
[2:13:52] Troo95: PikaRamen
[2:13:52] samuxtv: I remember in dragonflight i hit 1800 just by spamming 1 macro with sub literally one button. Its bullshit and takes skill out of the game
[2:13:57] derkushl: imagine, no addon, just nothing, pure gem and a world first raid ;)
[2:14:00] dizzyy_oce: this is 100% some EU bullshit
[2:14:03] dizzyy_oce: 10000%
[2:14:05] lilplatotv: @drfeltgood lmao
[2:14:08] sunsetjaxon: they cheat on international csgo on stage
[2:14:11] drfeltgood: Fucking EU trash
[2:14:14] lilplatotv: EU SHIT 100000
[2:14:21] inspect4: @dizzyy_oce it was literally na rog using it kek
[2:14:21] Meednes: Pine that's mouseover, cursor is for aoe targetted things like blizzard
[2:14:22] bielhdh: bielhdh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! YOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:14:22] timmah25: that just casts it at your feet tho
[2:14:22] moistydank: if there are ways for people to exploit the game or anything for their own advantage they will. it’ll never change lol
[2:14:27] deepfriedbrainforlunch: pepeD
[2:14:31] whiteboy1136: the only @player macro i use is innervate for me in Rdru lol
[2:14:32] Promocodebaj: @samuxtv let me get that macro Kappa
[2:14:40] TheeOcean: @PineTreesz youre talking about mousevers
[2:14:41] poroyou: I don't think hes mad at @cursor so much as being able to chain together that set
[2:14:44] Ferrnius: absterge definitely has @cursor for totems
[2:14:45] mexirican81: @drfeltgood bro facts....
[2:14:46] realgunner77: @cursor is QoL macros
[2:14:47] dizzyy_oce: @inspect4 EU made it, NA dumb enough to get caught kek
[2:14:49] Gore90: The fact that these kinds of macros exist at all proves that Blizzard 1) doesnt have a clue and 2) doesnt care
[2:14:49] drfeltgood: Ill gift u a sub @Pikabooirl if u ban that @PineTreesz
[2:14:50] cixelp: issue with this macro is that it saves cursor position before the shadowstep happens, not after
[2:14:50] emindagoat: i love that macro
[2:14:51] brevillance_: @Meednes sterge 100% uses @cursor macros; its super useful for totems
[2:14:53] samuxtv: @promocodebaj lol it was fixed after the first few weeks, it was the secret tech  macro that 1 shot
[2:15:03] Boomer_Brian: how would you feel about the complete removal of macros?
[2:15:09] vinwrx: they are on your team using it LUYL
[2:15:11] whiteboy1136: bro i just suck and need addons ;-;
[2:15:13] drfeltgood: MOD ME
[2:15:14] sunsetjaxon: well its game design. Casuals vs. competitive
[2:15:17] heavykeyboard: the real wow hardcore... no addons no macros
[2:15:17] venruki: bro did you see the macro I found today? can pre grapple back to your target -> shs -> kick someone else, it looks like cheating
[2:15:17] Maaybees: that right there is why i wont have the mount next season or this season xD
[2:15:19] TheeOcean: pinetreez is just confused.. doesnt know what he's defending. probably 1500
[2:15:20] Holla_AtchaBoy: are you saying you value the pure skill of gameplay required to do that naturally
[2:15:23] sunsetjaxon: Casuals vs competitive
[2:15:25] Promocodebaj: @samuxtv fuck.. i mean, i wouldnt use it
[2:15:27] cixelp: it should take cursor position after the shadowstep happens so that you don't go back to where you were before the shadowstep
[2:15:28] dizzyy_oce: @venruki he just saw the clip
[2:15:30] ExylTheElf: what did i miss something?
[2:15:31] brevillance_: @venruki he just watched it
[2:15:33] i_Static: @venruki timing KEKW
[2:15:33] Gmoneyda_ticket: Gmoneyda_ticket subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 1 month streak! WE GOT A NEW JOB SO WE RESUBBBED
[2:15:35] venruki: oh LOL
[2:15:35] NoChillPrims: made that macro and like its op
[2:15:36] bigchurchman: "exploit early exploit often" -Asmongold lol
[2:15:37] barret784: pika battling the @cursor
[2:15:40] venruki: that shit is FRIED
[2:15:41] Ferrnius: why'd my boi pine get timed out he was spitting facts :))
[2:15:41] R1_Prototype: honestly hold on tho. @cursor just fixes a problem made by blizzard. why aren’t the ground targeted spells normal targeted spells to begin with?
[2:15:44] samuxtv: @promocodebaj Literally every rogue was using it, if you wernt pika you wernt climbing
[2:15:47] ExylTheElf: What the hell is going on?
[2:15:48] drfeltgood: pINTREES. BURN IN HELL]
[2:15:49] i_Static: it was pinetreez in the clip KEKW
[2:15:52] moistydank: super fried lol
[2:15:52] mianerten: @venruki sub bbg uwu
[2:15:58] brevillance_: @venruki also hi ven! <3
[2:16:01] TheeOcean: @venruk tats what the last 5-10 mins of the stream was about
[2:16:06] vmills: @drfeltgood get em lololol
[2:16:10] samuxtv: @promocodebaj It would take me 2-4s to press all that meanwhile they do it in .1s, glad it got nerfed
[2:16:11] matt_caste: I honestly just use at cursor and at player because I don't wanna click twice on certain things. Def shouldn't be able to break the game with it, not sure how to fix it without nerfing a bunch of QoL, but having it is worse for the game than not
[2:16:13] ExylTheElf: SOMEONE DROP THIS CLIP I'M SO LOST.
[2:16:17] poroyou: They could fix it by making the @cursor have to go last
[2:16:19] vinwrx: but people are using it awc LUL
[2:16:20] drfeltgood: God im tilted
[2:16:21] averagenjoyerrrr: people hard stuck at 1600 do KEKW
[2:16:22] AmiiGodx: pika can you send me your weakaura addon?
[2:16:25] poroyou: you shouldn't get to pre-set it
[2:16:29] logantataryn: Im hardstuck 1200, and i think that kinda stuff is totally fine
[2:16:30] Dritzzts: easy fix is to just put grapple on GCD
[2:16:30] sunsetjaxon: the keyboard used to be intimidating for me
[2:16:31] jay_deetv: @pikabooirl don’t you think the complexity of certain rotations is kinda the reason why this is such a problem? it’s super prohibitive for new players, rather than learn they just do shit like that
[2:16:32] liddless: just put it on movement on its own global
[2:16:38] cixelp: the button shouldn't capture cursor position before the shadowstep and it's fixed
[2:16:38] matt_caste: No macro should be spammable for a sequence, simple
[2:16:46] overmancffc: That is right the point to say that this wow pvp design now is shit now
[2:16:47] ihypothermia: idk about you but when im in the arena im 150 apm typing out each move like /cast slam /cast enrage
[2:16:49] samuxtv: Agree matt
[2:16:50] samuxtv: 100%
[2:16:52] Ferrnius: well you cant keep some but remove others, if you're not allowed to do multiple things at once then your shadowdance macro that uses trinkets should be gutted too
[2:16:53] Xenic0501: Yo let me get some of those boxes
[2:16:57] sunsetjaxon: nah fuck that
[2:16:57] poroyou: No one should be able to step + kick + land where you were in 1 key
[2:16:58] R1_Prototype: why aren’t @cursor spells targeted to begin with?
[2:16:59] xchilam: Yes 100%
[2:16:59] dizzyy_oce: surely they can change macro's to not work with if statements
[2:17:00] hynesceltics: so many crates lmao
[2:17:03] Meednes: Sstep and grapple put one another on small cd, foxed
[2:17:06] moistydank: agreed @matt_caste
[2:17:09] boocraft1992: they need to make wow MOP again
[2:17:11] heavykeyboard: make an arena mode like that... no addons no macros... like a competitive ladder
[2:17:14] vmills: make wow simple again
[2:17:23] tigerslap_ow: maybe limit 1 ability per macro
[2:17:26] boocraft1992: MOP was the pinnacle of wow arena
[2:17:28] brevillance_: honestly give the option to use @cursor for area spells as part of the base game and you can remove it from macros
[2:17:29] matt_caste: If macros couldn't spammable like that one palumor just showed straight shouldn't function. It's old school swifty 1 shot style
[2:17:31] barret784: sequence macros suck
[2:17:33] drfeltgood: They need to just shut down the EU servers.. simple fix for cheating
[2:17:39] venruki: put grapple on global :)
[2:17:40] daltine: u couldnt even do that grapple hook step kick macro by yourself they should def scrap that shit
[2:17:40] vinwrx: bliz enabled it so they think it's good for the game LUL
[2:17:40] TroxerD: same with weakauras, they should remove every single one of them
[2:17:41] venruki: fixed
[2:17:45] dizzyy_oce: Jaime Susge
[2:17:49] Dritzzts: @venruki ^
[2:17:50] moistydank: they only say it’s good for the game if they use it and win. then when said person goes up against it and loses, that’s when they will say its shit lol
[2:17:53] knucklesthedruid: i've noticed it a lot healing
[2:17:54] deepfriedbrainforlunch: saw worst shit
[2:17:56] JesusTbyte: We need macros with conditionals so i can play with 1 button, that would fix the game fr fr
[2:17:57] NoChillPrims: macro goes so fast that the kick doesn't even go off cuz you move so fast lol
[2:17:58] Peachxp_: only complex macro i personally think the game needs is like holyshock/penance/living flame, its a harm and heal spell so without my macro i have to swap my target to myself to heal myself with shock kinda silly
[2:18:01] phanabananana: Its all off global stuff
[2:18:01] millennialmurphy: macroers gonna macro
[2:18:04] vmills: @drfeltgood omg hahaha excellent solution
[2:18:06] Ryso33: querying gpt :X
[2:18:07] poroyou: It's not really macros so much as pre-setting the grapple - if you changed it so grapple went last it wouldnt be bad
[2:18:08] venruki: i used palumor's 8 button cast sequence to kill as sub
[2:18:09] venruki: LOL
[2:18:10] TheeOcean: A lot of these macros are gate keeping new players from players that even know that type stuff even exists. cast sequences push 1500 players to 2k
[2:18:14] Promocodebaj: Goat Ven in the chat
[2:18:15] vinwrx: you dont use any macros??
[2:18:16] brevillance_: @TroxerD L take, its useful for tons of stuff that the base UI cant do
[2:18:20] otherbarry1: nah confitional are nice for QOL
[2:18:22] sunsetjaxon: i have never used cheats but some people only play with cheats pika
[2:18:23] cixelp: put grapple on global or make cursor position not save until after the shadowstep so that it moves with you when y ou shadowstep
[2:18:28] deepfriedbrainforlunch: they make st macros with one button LUL
[2:18:32] Ferrnius: conditional macros i agree are harmful for the game, but @cursor and @mouseover have been integral since forever
[2:18:35] steve_ab: any addon that isn't QoL (ie Altoholic) should be removed from the game
[2:18:35] cixelp: and just doesn't work, you have to be fast and move your mouse
[2:18:35] USForces: It has existed for a long time. You used to be able to put mage entire combust chain on 1 button and just spam it
[2:18:45] Boomer_Brian: start the movement and remove all macros
[2:18:45] Pingabreath: I found mop was decent for pvp arena
[2:18:50] barret784: no step kick focus macro?
[2:19:00] phanabananana: What makes focus kick macros good for the game
[2:19:02] matt_caste: People use a very similar on step kick, cast sequence should always have a built in GCD and any macro that isn't a cast sequence ONLY does up to the first line, not jump over stuff on CD
[2:19:04] Woodhard: Macro'ni and cheese.
[2:19:07] R1_Prototype: @ focus and @mouseover and all you actually need.
[2:19:08] vinwrx: "basic macros" umm ok
[2:19:20] matt_caste: That's a simple fix that doesn't break any QoL
[2:19:24] cixelp: i think the problem here is that you grapple back to where you put your cursor before your shadowstepped
[2:19:32] Suchacrisis: You give humans an inch they take a mile man. A lot of this stuff is great QoL in PvE like @cursor, but they just go too far
[2:19:34] Dash4cash723: drfeltgood hating on a continent because of a macro haha
[2:19:34] jay_deetv: i legit have 0 macros, just feel like total cheats
[2:19:35] poroyou: ^
[2:19:35] vinwrx: been playing longer then your sir
[2:19:36] vmills: I have a solid /sleep macro to go lay on people in arena after my team kills them lol
[2:19:40] daltine: nah alot of cheesey macro defenders in here
[2:19:41] Blitzylive: you def. fried
[2:19:46] TheeOcean: if all macros were removed from the game it would be a better step forward in pvp then these wild ones that shouldnt exists
[2:19:47] cantfindthebox: some dude just used macros a lot, probably put 2+2 together
[2:19:48] sunsetjaxon: that's the new shit the game is always growing
[2:19:52] Chvz1447: catJAM
[2:19:57] cantfindthebox: probably wasn't hard to figure out for someone the first time they manually did it
[2:19:59] NoChillPrims: making less macros and making the game more simplified would be huge and possibly even bring in more players
[2:19:59] vinwrx: you're using macros
[2:20:00] rambomatrix: remove macros and addons
[2:20:08] cixelp: like they can fix it without getting rid of @cursor by making it so that it moves you to where cursor is -after- the shadowstep
[2:20:12] notoriousztv: its like an aimbot
[2:20:13] Shxcky: @Pikabooirl Thought on WW?
[2:20:13] barret784: its literally step kick macro with @cursor to hook faster
[2:20:14] Promocodebaj: they defend it because they use and need it
[2:20:17] cantfindthebox: i think the game should be able to be humanly played, anything that takes the human element out of it should be gone
[2:20:19] drfeltgood: @Pikabooirl they're defending because they're cheating EU trash
[2:20:21] Dallywacker: NGL its weird the cast sequence macros  100 %are bad for the game
[2:20:25] poroyou: I don't think anyone is disagreeing with you about that macro - I think they're responding to the idea of removing macros
[2:20:25] TheeOcean: REMOVE ALL MACROS AND ADDONS
[2:20:32] GornallSWCCG: Missed the macro - is it basically the same as charge/hamstring macro?
[2:20:34] chubmaster92: @Pikabooirl I Main Boomkin Druid but im looking for an alt to play, which class should i pick that is similar to boomie play style?
[2:20:34] Suchacrisis: No defending it, it's insane. But when its very simple like @mouseover its just huge for healing in PvE to not rip your hair out
[2:20:35] vinwrx: i dont even play wow anymore, just asking LUL
[2:20:36] Dritzzts: @drfeltgood NA also use these macros LOL
[2:20:38] balduar101: I have not used macros in wow, I don't understand em
[2:20:41] itzR4B: they out of touch with reality -_-
[2:20:43] sunsetjaxon: default WoW is better experience
[2:20:54] timmah25: the game would be so much more interesting if they removed macros and addons from pvp
[2:20:55] cantfindthebox: im a clicker, i've never used a macro except to like put text on iceblock or something
[2:20:58] woknarf: true, but if there was 'legal' advantage, everyone would/should use it
[2:20:59] phanabananana: Weak auras and addons are much more closer to cheating then any macros could ever be
[2:20:59] Suchacrisis: yeah no shot
[2:20:59] VonShank: link the clip
[2:21:02] Anciexnt: i bought a pikachu pillow and named it pikaboo
[2:21:04] liddless: reminds me of fps players defending xims
[2:21:04] steve_ab: GnomeSequencer is the worst for macro abuse
[2:21:07] notoriousztv: raw cheese
[2:21:09] yum_nachos: tf is raw cheese
[2:21:10] itzJustcause: raw cheese?
[2:21:11] Dash4cash723: drfeltgood ain’t a smart guy haha
[2:21:11] drfeltgood: @Dritzzts you are now an Identified CHEATER GG go eat a baguette
[2:21:11] nehis_97: @drfeltgood what did EU do to you damn xD
[2:21:12] TactiTortoise: Id love it if they got rid of all that shit. I think PvP would benefit from a slight simplification.
[2:21:12] Maaybees: chatgpi wrting macros out here
[2:21:14] PeptoAbysmal: so just cheese
[2:21:16] rambomatrix: weak auras, gladius, omni cc, big debuffs
[2:21:16] poroyou: The problem with that macro is spell queing, but its the same mechanics as Evoker Rescue Macros, where you can rescue people to your current position
[2:21:17] yum_nachos: just eat some cheddar dawg
[2:21:19] sunsetjaxon: bro some guys only play with cheats
[2:21:21] bazooka_steve: YOOOOO
[2:21:22] TactiTortoise: New players cant play this game, not in PvP
[2:21:27] bazooka_steve: thursday tomorrow thank god
[2:21:29] itzR4B: its gotta be equal in the end
[2:21:30] 777delayed: the people who defend this stuff are lower xp players who cannot compete at a slightly above average level of gameplay. they just want those cheese type of mechanics because it negates the skill gap between them an actual players @Pikabooirl
[2:21:30] jay_deetv: the question is really where do you draw the line, if you allow some macros, but not all
[2:21:32] Suchacrisis: Back in the day watching people like you, ven, rekful pull the shit off a macro does is what made me get better
[2:21:36] itsrikodeine: what do you think about weak auras that are telling you what to press @Pikabooirl
[2:21:37] Suchacrisis: Realize wait I can do this if he can
[2:21:40] libnip: So you’re eating a lunchables
[2:21:47] Amaki_II: The extent of my macro usage is to make my pets attack when I hit certain spells, and @cursor aoe spells
[2:21:49] Dritzzts: @drfeltgood ill enjoy my vegemite instead KEKW
[2:21:53] incognito_enjoyer: First time in stream here... But look at the wow community. Of course you have people like him defending that macro, most of the wow community guys gold
[2:22:03] barret784: always wondered why Pika  doesnt use @cursor at all
[2:22:05] TheeOcean: @jay_deetv im down with all macro removal from pvp
[2:22:11] vmills: I think making @drfeltgood a mod in this stream would clean a lot of this cheating up TBH.. @pikabooirl
[2:22:15] Pingabreath: link clip wat happened
[2:22:16] vinwrx: if cheats are available people will use them. common sense.
[2:22:17] otherbarry1: Anyone clip it?
[2:22:18] poroyou: The fix for that macro is fixing spell queing - the grapple should go last
[2:22:21] liddless: at the same time, you wanna know how you get it fixed? make all the top tier rogues use it, you'll see it get fixed so fast
[2:22:33] tolginyoo: @777delayed what rating is considered average in this game?
[2:22:43] cixelp: yeah they need to move when in the macro cursor position gets 'saved' because it seems like it saves before shadowstep happens instead of before the grapple
[2:22:44] kubie: imagine being a new player and having to get macros like that to compete
[2:22:45] Promocodebaj: Watch Palamours youtube video people who want clip
[2:22:50] avoice2211: mozarella
[2:22:51] poroyou: the idea of macroing step + kick + hook isn't bad - what is bad is the grapple gets placed first
[2:22:53] yum_nachos: lmao
[2:22:53] daltine: u should get banned for using that dumb shit liek the conditionals
[2:22:54] Dysic: raw milk?
[2:22:58] Boomer_Brian: drink raw eggs too
[2:23:01] sunsetjaxon: it was a sequence macro pushing 4 rouge abilities in a row. perfectly. & quickly incredibly fast
[2:23:02] bangbangbaby69: Anyone like Bleu cheese? 10/10
[2:23:02] i_Static: raw cheese macro
[2:23:03] reavethederp: raw like unpasterized?
[2:23:04] drfeltgood: bro that shit can kill u
[2:23:08] woknarf: raw cheese lol!!
[2:23:09] eyah: solo shuf wheel today? @pikabooirl
[2:23:10] carrvve: HY. raw dairy is super good for you
[2:23:11] barret784: interent health advice why not
[2:23:12] snakz009: Ive never heard people call uncooked cheese raw chesse
[2:23:18] itzJustcause: drink cooked eggs, i heard its best gains
[2:23:20] Marshall_Eriksen_: pikabooMove
[2:23:22] notoriousztv: might be the raw cheese angle
[2:23:23] TheBiggestManOnCampus: bro you literally said you cut out diary on last nights stream
[2:23:29] superkkn: swifty one shot macro
[2:23:31] i_Static: spin the wheel im trying to see some frost DK
[2:23:34] vinwrx: @daltine i dont even play wow. how can you ban someone for something available in the game??? lmao
[2:23:35] liddless: awc this week, see all the rogues using this macro, they'll fix it by tuesday
[2:23:36] reavethederp: raw dairy is sus unless u live on your own farm or somthing like that
[2:23:40] Dritzzts: instagram is the best source of information
[2:23:50] cantfindthebox: pika gonna be faritng on stream
[2:23:52] poroyou: Do you think Pasterizing cheese is the reason cheese is bad for you?
[2:23:52] BBRodriguez86: gains in ur bowels
[2:23:56] Pingabreath: just eaat greek yogurt bruv
[2:23:56] sunsetjaxon: tha cheeeese
[2:23:57] DrongoLightning: you're getting fucking scammed, pasturisation is just boiling
[2:23:58] vmills: rip it was nice knowing you pika
[2:24:02] Dritzzts: pikabooW
[2:24:02] TheKidRobin: liver king :)
[2:24:03] barret784: he is useing shit most likely
[2:24:08] i_Static: he’s on steroids not raw cheese lmao
[2:24:08] cantfindthebox: girls be saying that to me pika
[2:24:09] Suchacrisis: L;OL
[2:24:11] Amaki_II: I can't even imagine cutting dairy from my diet.  I love it too much
[2:24:11] lilplatotv: thats why you gotta buy the liver kings supps
[2:24:16] Marshall_Eriksen_: hello pika will u say hello to my friend hades? greetings from chile :D
[2:24:17] Promocodebaj: facts
[2:24:17] Shihametsu: Lol
[2:24:24] klublast: EAT CLEN TREN HARD
[2:24:32] el_taco42O: mad cows disease dude
[2:24:32] vinwrx: AI > *
[2:24:33] TheKidRobin: literally everyone in gytm on some form of steroids lol
[2:24:35] poroyou: LETS GO JASON!! (btw Jason is pikaboo, i can use his first name because we are tight like that. yeah i know top players but its not a big deal to me lol)
[2:24:39] daltine: @vinwrx u answered urself u dont play so it dont matter to u
[2:24:43] Xanthiumg: pika you need Gorilla Mode Nitric pre work out. gets the pump going stupid
[2:24:52] Suchacrisis: hahahah like when I run for 30 mins and guy next to me still goin, guess he had more water than me
[2:25:04] tolginyoo: @poroyou LUL
[2:25:06] PineTreesz: timed out for pointing out the issue isn't @cursor macros its that everything within the macro is off gcd. smh
[2:25:07] carrvve: yo pika if it isnt a burden wanna drop that build link
[2:25:08] Alegral: Any dh action today ur fav class? Kappa
[2:25:14] vinwrx: @vinwrx i quit because of this bullshit sir
[2:25:18] firemarcosrl: is it your birthday?
[2:25:23] Maaybees: have you heard the five finger death punch cover of this song? so good
[2:25:34] i_Static: !birthday
[2:25:34] Nightbot: TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!
[2:25:37] kevogasm: It takes the skill out of the game
[2:25:42] vmills: time him out again!!!!
[2:25:50] cixelp: it registers cursor position before it runs the commands instead of just before the command trhat uses it
[2:25:57] carrvve: !build
[2:25:58] altruverse: i think its probably difficult to change that type of thing because its such a basic part of how wow works and the coding on the back-end
[2:26:00] poroyou: Pika, real talk, do you think cheese is bad for you bc of it being pasterized?
[2:26:03] daltine: do u think u could do what that macro does by urself all natty
[2:26:05] sunsetjaxon: what kinda weird shit
[2:26:07] elit3baby: !birthday
[2:26:07] Nightbot: TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!
[2:26:11] sunsetjaxon: with macros
[2:26:12] veltrinor: isnt the problem all that shit is off gcd
[2:26:15] KillaSoSerious: im on the side of these macros are bs but isnt this the same as weak auras ?
[2:26:16] PineTreesz: fyi i play rdruid/Dpriest... so this doesn't even apply to me rofl.
[2:26:20] TheeOcean: @PineTreesz you clearly NEEED macros to pvp. thats what youre defending
[2:26:25] Dritzzts: how do u feel about @cursor grappling hook alone?
[2:26:27] vinwrx: they only opened it up more
[2:26:28] i_Static: grapple on the gcd ezpz
[2:26:33] Suchacrisis: agree
[2:26:33] notoriousztv: weakauras are broken
[2:26:35] itsmejasperr: pika best class to start pvping on?
[2:26:37] Blitzylive: only if they reduce buttons
[2:26:37] Alegral: Remove everything
[2:26:38] poroyou: Macros is an accessibility issue
[2:26:38] jay_deetv: @poroyou why would that make it bad for you?
[2:26:40] vinwrx: they have never dialed back on it
[2:26:40] pridez49: agreed
[2:26:43] Pingabreath: separate pvp game
[2:26:43] PineTreesz: @TheeOcean again i play rdruid and drpiest.... these macros don't even apply to my class.
[2:26:45] cantfindthebox: but pika
[2:26:48] volxine: back to the basics
[2:26:50] cantfindthebox: then people would have to learn to play the game
[2:26:52] jeshiret: you only say that cause you play almost fully retro LOL
[2:26:52] satirically1: step and kick arent on gcd so putting grapple on gcd doesnt fix that macro at all
[2:26:52] Peachxp_: i use more weakauras this season than ever b4, wow has become a game of horns and alerts KEKW
[2:26:53] vinwrx: @cursor is NEW
[2:26:53] heavykeyboard: nah just keep count lol
[2:26:54] Blitzylive: game has too many buttons
[2:26:56] sapyokidz: they should limit in tourney play
[2:26:56] Promocodebaj: it seems like the most they're willing to do is reduce number of spells at times
[2:26:57] R1_Prototype: they would need to add a few addons baseline to remove them all
[2:26:58] monkeeztailz: Not in this version
[2:26:59] cixelp: yo it is wild to me that there aren't basic cooldown/DR trackers in the game when they use it in the AWC ui
[2:27:01] altruverse: maybe they can force players to not use macro keybinds in arena
[2:27:03] superkkn: pika do you think awc should ban and pick
[2:27:04] methudz: Yo what's the rotation with sepsis?
[2:27:04] notoriousztv: thats all you need and all there should be
[2:27:08] Alegral: At least remove for pvp
[2:27:13] poroyou: A lot of these addons go a long way for accessibility
[2:27:19] atorob: i just dont fking get shuffle, teammates run out of my intervene every time, dont cc or kick heals, and im the one that loses every time
[2:27:19] R1_Prototype: what is the point of arena skirmish?
[2:27:20] jay_deetv: yes remove addons if you make it simpler. there’s so much to keep track of I don’t think it’s great in its current state
[2:27:22] TheeOcean: @PineTreesz nobody believes you, youd only defend this because you need them
[2:27:22] xps9000: they could but they won’t
[2:27:22] yidowxo: pikaboo is it true u have a horse fallace
[2:27:23] overmancffc: no trackers make the game more robotics , cancel those too
[2:27:24] l_stan: taking out addons will higher the skill floor, which would be better for competitive
[2:27:25] BanJharTV: hey whats that song pls
[2:27:30] carrvve: based more skill that way
[2:27:31] altruverse: joining arena disables addons and clears any keybinds with a macro
[2:27:31] i_Static: just need a selfie cam macro
[2:27:33] matt_caste: except all those weird script people were running
[2:27:33] moistydank: for pvp maybe but I think with PVE they can’t cuz of everything going on and that transfers to pvp ya know?
[2:27:33] smeagolx: omni cd kinda nice for solo shuffle tho
[2:27:34] 777delayed: i would so rather no addons be a thing. i just like to see the damage meters thats it
[2:27:37] nkolke12: too many things going on is what prevents me from coming back to the game
[2:27:41] PineTreesz: @TheeOcean check pvp me then... pinetrees-emerald dream
[2:27:43] atorob: i fking hate this
[2:27:44] Suchacrisis: addons were a solution to a problem that doesnt have to exist
[2:27:44] DrongoLightning: that macro works with warrior fear/charge/leap btw
[2:27:48] cantfindthebox: It would definitely make it a more even playing field
[2:27:50] PineTreesz: and pinex - emerald dream
[2:27:51] vinwrx: for years @cursor didn't work... blizz ADDED it
[2:27:51] overmancffc: Can you imagine in Mobs , someone track your Ultimate CDs ?
[2:27:52] cantfindthebox: without macros and addons
[2:27:53] QuentinJames: they removed a lot of spell visuals unfortunantly
[2:27:54] Maaybees: 100% would skill would matter way more
[2:27:54] Promocodebaj: i wonder how many pros wouldnt make awc if they had 0 addons
[2:27:55] RedactedinRed: if they removed addons and these macros, botters would be 10x better no?
[2:27:58] steve_ab: Both my mouse & kb have software available to make macros not kept in game files
[2:27:58] carrvve: i dont have as much fun with addons
[2:28:00] Djingozor: Imagine MDI being played without addons
[2:28:02] SwiisH_Tv: Im ok with most addons its the WAs that are to much
[2:28:03] Ryso33: fr lol
[2:28:06] yidowxo: PIKABOO IS MY BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:28:10] Oddeed: true
[2:28:12] vmills: it might make healing a larger skill cap but I would love it
[2:28:14] Blitzylive: but you use them too bro
[2:28:25] Amaki_II: People would actually have to LEARN game mechanics instead of having an add-on tell you what to do...
[2:28:27] Dritzzts: lmao no
[2:28:30] Evoca85: If they eliminate addons, people would flip out initially but I think over time everyone will like it
[2:28:33] poroyou: I think your stuck thinking about the highest levels of play, a lot of people need addons to be able to play at all bc accessibility
[2:28:38] atorob: I need to find a new game to play
[2:28:38] vinwrx: im out chat, yall need help. arena is fucked.
[2:28:41] cantfindthebox: i use to pvp without addons and had a blast, now i use more and feel like i look at them more than the game
[2:28:41] brevillance_: honestly i have omniCD and i barely even register it; i usually look right through it
[2:28:44] nurotv: alt z challenge
[2:28:46] cantfindthebox: and i dont use any more than you do
[2:28:51] jay_deetv: maybe just make it less buttons, I’m gonna die on this hill
[2:28:52] overmancffc: yea
[2:28:56] overmancffc: yeap
[2:28:57] bazooka_steve: i like that in league of legends you have to keep track of big spells and stuff in your head
[2:29:00] i_Static: remember that guy that had 7 blind icons on his screen good times
[2:29:00] Suchacrisis: youll find the great players wont need them and wont care
[2:29:01] matt_caste: bUt yOU UsE thEm tOO
[2:29:02] overmancffc: I ve been using no addons at all
[2:29:04] unlimitedenergy8814: how you been fam
[2:29:05] Promocodebaj: @Pikabooirl new challenge. turn off all addons for 2s
[2:29:14] smeagolx: i agree 100% game would be better, less robotic and more engaging
[2:29:15] StigFN: @bazooka_steve You dont tho
[2:29:18] TheeOcean: weakauras are completely ergregious to wow pvp, having something tell you what to press and when is  silly. not using them puts you at a massive disadvantage
[2:29:29] Pingabreath: hard reset wow pvp
[2:29:34] Alegral: Addonds literally tell u what to press which is dumb
[2:29:35] NoChillPrims: no addons solo shuff challenge
[2:29:36] Dallywacker: !song
[2:29:36] Nightbot: man of the year - schoolboy q
[2:29:38] overmancffc: Why you need tracker ? why dont you get a booster in 100 run in Olympics
[2:29:38] Rhinosaur___: you should try clicking
[2:29:38] vmills: idk I do really like big debuffs though lol the rest could go but I guess I could adapt and look at frames more
[2:29:42] reavethederp: dr tracker
[2:29:43] Suchacrisis: honestly trinket tracker is only thing I think is required lol
[2:29:44] TheKidRobin: they should
[2:29:45] boocraft1992: not gonna name any names but there's some players that cover like 90% of their screen with addons lol. without those addons i can't imagine how they'd play
[2:29:48] steve_ab: @TheeOcean 100% agree
[2:29:49] leibowitzr10: how much do i need to donate for you to disable all addons next game
[2:29:52] lilfafo: play outlaw without addons lol
[2:29:54] 777delayed: the game would be a better place
[2:29:56] jenny_yellow: no dr tracker no kicks
[2:29:57] overmancffc: I dont even have dr trackers
[2:30:01] DrongoLightning: just count in your brain bro
[2:30:01] Dallywacker: LMFAOO IT JUST TOLD ME THE SONG WAS MAN OF THE YEAR SCHOOL BOY Q
[2:30:03] altruverse: not to mention you feel the need to set up your addons perfectly for all 10 of your alts...takes forever
[2:30:06] thecone504: fuck addons give it to me raw daddy
[2:30:12] alcyone1985: dont forget to block WA
[2:30:15] brainstormerinc: wouldnt that be like play HC pvp :D?
[2:30:18] vinwrx: @Pikabooirl when you went to wow tournaments in person were you allowed to use addons??
[2:30:19] sunsetjaxon: they either have a kick or they dont?
[2:30:22] i_Static: it’s all or nothing buddy
[2:30:22] ASS_MUFFIN: they're removing adons?
[2:30:24] cantfindthebox: they could just add that to the game itself though
[2:30:26] Promocodebaj: I play with less addons than you have now and I prefer it that way
[2:30:26] jenny_yellow: No cooldown tracker of your own abilities either LUL
[2:30:27] cantfindthebox: and still ban addons
[2:30:29] sunsetjaxon: I play without any
[2:30:29] leibowitzr10: play next game with all addons disabled
[2:30:31] ChapAssless: i think not being able to see your teammates cds as a healer would make the 14 healers left in the game quit
[2:30:32] 777delayed: i only want kick and dr tracker. REMOVE EVERYTHING ELSE
[2:30:41] heavykeyboard: yea no addons no macros would be lit
[2:30:43] vmills: maybe just have arena above 1600 cr have addons disabled
[2:30:48] liddless: when is enough, enough
[2:30:49] vinwrx: @Pikabooirl when you went to wow tournaments in person were you allowed to use addons?
[2:30:59] jotwnky1995: CEO
[2:31:03] Kingnabious: Kingnabious subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! let’s go
[2:31:06] sunsetjaxon: pika did a no interface 1v2
[2:31:08] Maaybees: they should allow them in SS but not 3s since usually you are in coms
[2:31:08] heavykeyboard: they could crack down on bots too
[2:31:09] itsrikodeine: @ChapAssless think it would be better seeing them die and not knowing they had wall
[2:31:12] Peachxp_: dps would have to communicate waht cds they have to trade?> yea no thanks i hate skill
[2:31:13] Ryso33: i never look at him on healer lolll
[2:31:14] 777delayed: you know everyones playing a guessing game and it really comes down to who ACTUALLY is paying attention @Pikabooirl
[2:31:15] jay_deetv: but they could make the UI changes default in game and then remove add-ons isn’t a bad idea
[2:31:16] Ryso33: em*
[2:31:17] TheeOcean: *giant horn sound*.  "LOS THE LOCK".. flashing across your screen. lol dumb
[2:31:17] brevillance_: i played classic wow without anything other than bartender and the amount of shit i got from people i raided with for not having addons was insane, and retail is way more crazy
[2:31:19] Boomer_Brian: they should have a WoW R.A.W server
[2:31:19] Promocodebaj: @vinwrx it depends on what year you're talking about
[2:31:21] TimmyShoes: SWTOR doesn't allow addons. they also had a fully customizable UI a solid 8 years before WoW did lol
[2:31:29] vinwrx: @promocodebaj why O
[2:31:32] reavethederp: gnar gnar
[2:31:35] kreuger6233: Wow is too hard for new people addons are a big part of that. Thats why wow is dying
[2:31:36] Peachxp_: thats a streamer take
[2:31:37] TactiTortoise: I think if they were to roll all that stuff into a basic UI it would help people a ton, especially new players.
[2:31:37] vinwrx: @promocodebaj why I
[2:31:39] Djingozor: It sounds like u are asking for a different game :D
[2:31:40] 1znogood: like every other online competitive game...
[2:31:42] GornallSWCCG: No customization = NTY
[2:31:43] Suchacrisis: but your teammate can just tell you in comms if he has something down
[2:31:45] poroyou: What about people with accessibility issues, who need things bigger, or macros to save keybindings to even play the game?
[2:31:46] sunsetjaxon: gnar af bruh
[2:31:53] niuZIXIao: @TimmyShoes It is also a dead game isnt it?
[2:31:53] SneaqySquid: !playlist
[2:31:53] Nightbot: Youtube autoplay
[2:31:57] OpportunistHS: Just need less buttons or something
[2:32:02] GornallSWCCG: Are you 25 or 52?
[2:32:07] Promocodebaj: @vinwrx there were years where they couldnt use addons, but in more recent years they started allowing them
[2:32:12] smeagolx: addons are a big reason wow is popular tho so idk if ppl will go for it, competitive play its kinda gross tho
[2:32:12] Suchacrisis: back in BC/WOTLK we didn't have CD trackers, we just called out when our shit was down
[2:32:13] jay_deetv: @kreuger6233 100% worst in PvP, you have to learn sooo many things
[2:32:14] cixelp: i mean that's how dota or league work but there are like 4 abilities per person in those games
[2:32:14] abhorath: Being able to see your team mates die in shuffle without using their defesnives makes it so much more tilting
[2:32:17] Zevyn1312: Getting rid of addons wouldn't fix anything and would favour the tunnel visioned players who already just focus on doing nothing but dam
[2:32:19] tigerslap_ow: yeah there are way too many abilities and shit going on.
[2:32:19] TactiTortoise: Imagine if they had it set up in such a way to warn someone when a big CD popped? Like, you dont have to know the game well enough to know Ret Wings is scary, you just have to know the red bar flashing around their UI means run.
[2:32:20] libnip: You’d lose it without dmg meters 😂
[2:32:23] PineTreesz: @poroyou just disable it in competitive play. easy solution
[2:32:25] TheMercDeadpool: Or have a rated mode for rated content
[2:32:29] TimmyShoes: @niuZIXIao pvp is, yeah. there's enough of a population for the raids and stuff but rated pvp is dead and buried
[2:32:30] vinwrx: @promocodebaj because covid and the tournaments are not in person
[2:32:35] BBRodriguez86: lulz
[2:32:39] whiteboy1136: no....id like to know if im doing good dps
[2:32:39] golana77: Cry
[2:32:40] reavethederp: death log is fun to look at
[2:32:44] Dritzzts: remove ya meters this game
[2:32:45] BBRodriguez86: pika doin negative dam again
[2:32:49] sunsetjaxon: irrelevant meter
[2:32:50] Wukash_: i look at defensive cd's lmao
[2:32:50] Lukana06: !armory
[2:32:50] Nightbot: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/tichondrius/Tmpikaboo
[2:32:52] atorob: i lose so many games, i just stopped looking
[2:32:58] itsmistero: damage meters are what created metas and balance issues
[2:33:01] zachioo: fuck addons besides kick trackers
[2:33:02] Promocodebaj: @vinwrx idk if thats the reason
[2:33:02] boocraft1992: I immediately call myself pathetic when i lose
[2:33:04] i_Static: Warcraft chat wouldn’t have anything to bitch about
[2:33:07] zachioo: i hate that shit more than anything
[2:33:10] QuentinJames: to be fair end of game does show dmg already
[2:33:11] Dallywacker: Lowkey spitting facts and would bring true comp pvp back
[2:33:11] sunsetjaxon: i make game changing plays when it matters. no damage meter
[2:33:12] Capitanii: maybe for pvp but removing meters in pve would kinda ruin the fun of it
[2:33:13] TheeOcean: you should be able to adjust the entire UI to whatever you want. but nothing extra that someone else cant naturally see
[2:33:22] TimmyShoes: @niuZIXIao the casual bgs are still fun though. wow should clone huttball
[2:33:28] jay_deetv: yeah I mean it’s good to see if you’re fucking up, maybe it’s good to just see damage that you’ve done summarized
[2:33:35] vinwrx: @promocodebaj if blizz doesn't regulate what addons people are using tournaments are not legit imo.
[2:33:41] Sqwk: no need to track kicks, just fake kick till you hear you GOT EM. GG
[2:33:42] Ltbabyhands: lets just all go play raw SOD LMAO
[2:34:01] cantfindthebox: its cataclysm but for wow itself
[2:34:08] Promocodebaj: @vinwrx yeah, there are cheaters in awc too. most pros agree
[2:34:11] sunsetjaxon: @Ltbabyhands season of dragonflight?
[2:34:14] smeagolx: ay u never know WoW2 someday it would be insane
[2:34:15] TimmyShoes: if they got addons people would actually have to get good at the game
[2:34:17] threatlevelsus: please do not let poopoopeepee win
[2:34:19] TimmyShoes: got rid of*
[2:34:21] tigerslap_ow: they would never. too many players would leave.
[2:34:26] reavethederp: mabye they could test it on sod 4Head
[2:34:31] ASS_MUFFIN: did sod season 2 not pop off
[2:34:36] vinwrx: could you use any addon while at blizcon?
[2:34:39] traav_p: i think the casual player base would die off if that happened actually
[2:34:43] NelsonGamingShow: addon be cools pikaboomer
[2:34:54] overmancffc: make wow simpler by reduce number of abilties and no addons or offical addons modifies
[2:34:56] the_audacity_x: the_audacity_x subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 6 month streak! happy vday baby
[2:35:02] TheeOcean: @tigerslap_ow even tho the game would be better without those players
[2:35:12] eyah: start the no addons wave, lead the pack @pikabooirl
[2:35:13] Promocodebaj: @ASS_MUFFIN it had way less hype around it, but i think it's doing well
[2:35:14] i_Static: I do think it would incentivize new players to PvP 100% more
[2:35:30] overmancffc: maek the game designed like other competitive games
[2:35:34] cantfindthebox: YOU CANT TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY UI PIKA
[2:35:34] vinwrx: how is anyone good then LUL
[2:35:38] smeagolx: wow 2 pls
[2:35:41] cantfindthebox: I CAN TAKE THEM OFF IF I WANT TO, YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD
[2:35:46] vinwrx: so 2018 blizzcon zero addons
[2:35:47] Ferrnius: arena without gladius?
[2:35:50] atorob: addons arent that huge, i play with weakauras and all that and still cant do shit
[2:35:51] carrvve: def could get more people into wow
[2:35:56] ralvich: no addons = raw wow
[2:35:56] scotskoogen: You should make a no addon alt and do it once a week or somehting
[2:36:00] jotwnky1995: aka asmondgold
[2:36:04] Zevyn1312: Addons wouldn't be as important if the game wasn't designed so that you're massively disadvantaged for not having them.
[2:36:08] overmancffc: Yeap Watching wow is a nightmare
[2:36:09] the_audacity_x: to be fair there is alot going on
[2:36:11] vinwrx: pika doesn't need addons
[2:36:16] OG_Sparrow_: bro im trying to play outlaw but im not getting it. i got the dmg and rotation and i understand the talents but when it works its weiiiiird feeling
[2:36:16] vinwrx: people do tho...
[2:36:19] TofuRious_: they need to use the arena spectator UI for all players. clean and easy to read
[2:36:22] healhut: 2.1k no addons challenge? SeemsGood @Pikabooirl @venruki
[2:36:23] Promocodebaj: I cant watch streams with lots of addons
[2:36:24] TimmyShoes: it's true. i tried to get my friend into wow and he watched a stream and was like "what in the ADHD is this? too much going on"
[2:36:25] xHukk: I like that ability to customize  your own UI though
[2:36:27] Dritzzts: you and xaryu have the cleanest UI and its enjoygable to watch
[2:36:28] brevillance_: its nice that in Lost Ark all pvp is exactly the same; you can see exactly what they see, which is exactly what you see; makes it easier to understand
[2:36:29] cixelp: the AWC camera shows more than info stock UI can possibly show without addons
[2:36:32] 1znogood: are we doing no more shuffles? shit was so good content
[2:36:33] Maaybees: that would be a good youtube series see how far you can get with no addons from 0
[2:36:38] TheMercDeadpool: Or have a rated mode for rated content
[2:36:44] boocraft1992: 2400 no addon challenge
[2:36:44] lasergazer3: mindblown
[2:36:45] Ferrnius: AWC without gladius would hit different
[2:36:49] i_Static: spin the wheel bud
[2:36:49] OG_Sparrow_: should i just play sub in 2s? outlaw/healer seems like i do nothing
[2:36:52] darthhelmett: darthhelmett subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:37:07] Stenjp: !ui
[2:37:07] overmancffc: yeap
[2:37:07] Nightbot: PIKABOO UI: https://pastebin.com/h7GLTmu9
[2:37:08] PineTreesz: and way less competitive....
[2:37:09] lasergazer3: CHALLENGE: First Person
[2:37:10] vinwrx: i think pika would do fine without addons. not the same for everyone
[2:37:24] overmancffc: Randomness  make the competitive game less robotics
[2:37:24] Promocodebaj: Nothing against Mes as a player or person, but I can't watch his stream. Way too much clutter from addons
[2:37:26] abhorath: pls pls pls do a 222400 no addon challenge
[2:37:26] heavykeyboard: yea having an in depth understanding of the game really shines when there's no addons.
[2:37:27] TimmyShoes: and i was like "don't worry you just need to track your cds, track your teammates cds, track your enemy cds, track your drs, know when your healer is cc'ed, know when your dps is cc'ed, know when to burst, when to pop a defensive, track kicks, and that's it bro it's super simple"
[2:37:27] thorjax007: bro there aint no way your gpu is a 770
[2:37:32] Pingabreath: PVP Just needs its own mode
[2:37:33] jay_deetv: needs to be a sweet spot, vanilla one button rotations ain’t it, but 20 attacking abilities are a lot. creates too steep of a learning curve
[2:37:43] ASS_MUFFIN: if the game hald half as many buttons i'd pick it up agin
[2:37:43] lasergazer3: NEW CHALLENGE: First Person Arena
[2:37:45] OG_Sparrow_: i disagree...imagine playing against a WoW pro that just knows the game with no help
[2:37:47] Nightbot: Thrilled to announce my new Gaming Energy Drink Partner, Forgge. The #1 Healthy Energy Drink made for us gamers. Use code PIKABOO on ForggeEsports.com. Also available on Amazon with Prime Free Shipping https://amzn.to/3tDkSoa
[2:37:48] OG_Sparrow_: need handicaps.
[2:37:48] Dritzzts: also the game would shift to more fun content instead of gearing towards addons
[2:37:51] Zevyn1312: No addons favours more simple classes. Ret paladins are going to have an easier time than arcane mages, it's not as simple as saying "everyone's on the same level" without addons
[2:37:55] OpportunistHS: There is just too much going on. game need less buttons and shit
[2:37:56] vinwrx: im done pika sorry for ranting
[2:37:59] JasperXIII: hell for raid and M plus addons tell you everything about to happen
[2:38:00] Djingozor: World first race would prolly take 5 times longer
[2:38:01] overmancffc: I would say 15 is the max
[2:38:02] nooblordxd: not enough buttons imo
[2:38:02] PaimayTV: PaimayTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[2:38:04] TheeOcean: Almost as if the naturally talented not artificial addon boosted players would be best.
[2:38:08] Peachxp_: Got this WA from nahj actually so disgusting shit like this needs removed https://i.imgur.com/rXRoQut.jpeg Just meld when this pops up gg
[2:38:11] Suchacrisis: to be fair, rogue has always been pretty difficult, like mage
[2:38:12] PaimayTV: sheeeesh
[2:38:20] libnip: AWC announcers would be toasted without addons tracking
[2:38:24] TactiTortoise: I picked up Ret as an alt this last season because of how few buttons it has lol. I come from being an Enhance/Resto shaman... so, so  many buttons..
[2:38:31] Promocodebaj: @OG_Sparrow_ if you're saying you can't compete with a pro that doesn't need addons and you do, then ya'll shouldn't be the same rating
[2:38:34] cinagila: why you use sepsis talent again?
[2:38:35] courtappointedhealer: Less buttons and no addons in arena, make gladius and omni built in
[2:38:36] jay_deetv: @nooblordxd maybe for a hunter SMOrc
[2:38:37] cantfindthebox: so pika what you gonna do when you encounter someone with grapple macro
[2:38:39] will_k: will_k subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[2:38:41] Ryso33: kinda feel like dh amnt of buttons is good lol or mainly everything fits 2 bars
[2:38:49] cixelp: AWC UI is basic but it literally shows everyone's basic cooldowns which stock UI can't do
[2:38:53] Ferrnius: !help
[2:38:55] TimmyShoes: @Zevyn1312 i mean, there's no way to make all the classes equally complicated/simple. they can't even balance dmg lol
[2:39:04] PineTreesz: do you think the game is more or less competitive since addons were allowed in tourny play?
[2:39:07] Twonkey9: Twonkey9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[2:39:07] cixelp: stock UI used to not even show trinkets lol
[2:39:24] Noremorse77: Morning Jason, hope all is well.
[2:39:31] Chronozera: @OG_Sparrow_ that wouldn't happen because you arent the same rating, and if you were then you would know the game just as well
[2:39:38] lasergazer3: NEW CHALLENGE: First Person Arena
[2:39:39] Blitzylive: they just need to remove weak auras
[2:39:43] Talonin: Talonin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:39:49] Ferrnius: yo doest Nightbot have a command for addon profiles?
[2:39:56] Peachxp_: Are you playing the standard sepsis build atm?
[2:39:58] OpportunistHS: Didn't you used to play with no addons all the time?
[2:40:02] ralvich: they could add achievements that require no addons loaded. I think that would be a good compromise
[2:40:03] spicydeluxe_: 🙃
[2:40:03] courtappointedhealer: Pika does clone need a nerf?
[2:40:10] Pikabooirl: BUQAcWb37Z8KXj8LlE1rTPXfsBAkQAAAAAAItkkUSEkSTEigkkkkkItUSkUahgEiIpEBAAAgEA
[2:40:11] jherrera154: Pika when are we gonna see some ILLMINDOFBOO games? I loved watching the warrior smashing.
[2:40:16] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: you done with DH now? only saw outlaw in 3s
[2:40:19] TheeOcean: rmp takes a huge hit
[2:40:20] jay_deetv: they need to make some of the addons that are everywhere (meters, kick tracking, etc) part of the UI and remove the rest
[2:40:25] vmills: time for a retail hardcore mode of the game that is the exact same thing but just no addons
[2:40:26] cixelp: yeah like rdruid is instantly the best healer in the game without knowing party CDs and it's not close
[2:40:28] willeeman: happy v day pika, could you be my boo?
[2:40:37] Promocodebaj: @OpportunistHS he did. he was reluctant to add more but eveyone else had an advantage
[2:40:38] TimmyShoes: @ralvich idk man i don't think people would purposefully disadvantage themselves just to get an achievement lol.
[2:40:53] i_Static: are you shuffle Q’d on Tmpika?
[2:40:53] Zevyn1312: It would look even more melee centric
[2:40:53] Mateyunas: so.. classic? lol
[2:41:00] PeptoAbysmal: shuffle would be hilarious
[2:41:01] atorob: FUCK SHUFFLE
[2:41:04] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: if there were no add ons I feel like crusader would rule the world lol
[2:41:08] nooblordxd: no addons would be nice if they added some stuff to the base UI but there's also the issues of trying to tracks buffs on ur buff bar. i need my wa's
[2:41:08] ralvich: @timmyshoes depends on the reward attached
[2:41:17] bogei: i remember rekcful used to play with 0 addons, wild stuff
[2:41:23] courtappointedhealer: Blizzard should disable the UI in arena, play by intuition and pure skill
[2:41:30] traav_p: no vday plans tonight?
[2:41:41] altruverse: bless your soul
[2:41:47] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: bro. done with DH now?
[2:41:56] TimmyShoes: @ralvich what reward could make up for it? trying to play without addons against people with addons is like entering a marathon without sneakers when everyone else is on a bike lol
[2:42:00] TactiTortoise: They really could include so much of that stuff in the basic UI though. They already did a lot with the UI editor. If they could add team buff tracking, a DR tracker, and some kind of alert when big offensive CDs are popped, that would about cover it for most casual players
[2:42:04] Promocodebaj: @Pikabooirl hit "disable all" on your addons and do one 2s match like that
[2:42:10] ChapAssless: i havent touched my rogue since the changes tbh
[2:42:13] robsgaming117: I play without Addons
[2:42:28] jay_deetv: what are the add-ons they should make default so they could remove the rest?
[2:42:32] mimado94: you look like johnny depp

[2:42:48] lasergazer3: NEW CHALLENGE: First Person Arena
[2:42:56] courtappointedhealer: Imagine if they didn't allow arena macros either
[2:43:19] OpportunistHS: What addon shows your party CDs on their frames?
[2:43:20] Zevyn1312: What they need to do is simplify the game and make throughput more straightforward and refocus PVP on interactions/mechanics rather than just pumping like it's M+
[2:43:20] reavethederp: thug Pog
[2:43:21] Promocodebaj: bro weren't you full and had a burger? and a snack? and its 830 lol wtf u mean dinner
[2:43:31] Kristernal: Kristernal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[2:43:43] aoespawn: hi pika
[2:43:52] tricelolz: What we in queue for on the wheel atm? just tuned in
[2:43:57] cixelp: @Zevyn1312 throughput is already super straightforward on some classes but kinda wild on others
[2:44:00] OG_Sparrow_: @chronozera im talking about rote programming and if you think that rank 1 only plays at rank 1 ....look at your screen? lmao
[2:44:05] Promocodebaj: @chrye_xx he has. that's what started all the addon talk
[2:44:22] i_Static: mans first global was rain from above KEKW
[2:44:25] TimmyShoes: @ralvich maybe that'd be enough but i doubt it. too high of a mountain to climb just for some cosmetics
[2:44:29] robsgaming117: playing with out addons is hard since you can’t tell the DRs, mostly have audio qs and visual affects you have to rely on.
[2:44:36] chrye_xx: @promocodebaj makes sense lol thank you
[2:44:45] zemm8582: when should i use sepsis as sub?
[2:44:45] Promocodebaj: np
