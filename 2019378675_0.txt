[1:25:50] MakaiiART: they may have changed philosophy a bit, but it hasn't changed to "RPG doesn't exist, just let it be competitive"
[1:26:03] hammack52: it would still be cool as hell though
[1:26:39] MakaiiART: a bit different but i'd enjoy if logs could somehow get a 3d view like that, instead of just 2d position timeline

[3:59:40] hammack52: is lula still awake or did she go to sleep
[4:00:09] TheeCableguy: I finally got health insurance and can get some help with my weight loss too
[4:00:13] neftario105: @Towelliee how u lost so much weight? what u do?
[4:00:42] neftario105: ty @Towelliee will try it\
[4:01:15] Quantz89: Any side effects on the Ozempic ?
[4:01:27] TheeCableguy: yes
[4:01:48] Thicktatior: @Quantz89 dont use it for weight loss
[4:03:17] geokouts: GoodMorning Towelliee and chat! Happy New Year :) i am here to change time again with you and the chat :)
[4:03:18] Thicktatior: @Quantz89 What the doctors prescribing it for weight loss arnt telling you is you can come off it
[4:04:54] Quantz89: @Thicktatior Not necessarely looking into for myself. Just wondering. Can't get it prescribed anyways becaus it's on a world wide shortage ant its primary use is for diabetes control

[4:05:02] Thicktatior: once you stop taking it, your forcing yourself into a type 2 diabetic. My Dr stright told me to get off it as soon as i went into him
[4:06:00] Thicktatior: @Quantz89 Yeah I know i couldnt get refills for like 6 month
[4:06:40] Quantz89: @Thicktatior I dont think so. You just need to combine it with proper diet and learn how to eat and work out. You just cant see it as a miracle shot and get off it once you loose the weight
[4:06:49] geokouts: sometimes you get 2 or 3 if you are lucky per harvest
[4:07:42] Thicktatior: What its doing is telling your body to not produce insulin, because you have this medicine in your body. eventually your pancreas is like ok you dont need me anymore and stops working. They are just finding this in people that have been taking it long term
[4:08:02] Metrii: It wont make you a type 2 diabetic after you stop using it. its a peptide. Yeah if you were injecting insulin like bodybuilders you would potentially become type 2 diabetic but ozempic does not function in that same way and is WAY safer.
[4:08:38] hailstormz: so prot pallys
