[2:14:00] DaCrazyAngus: rare inTG dont have a base
[2:14:01] moophoria2008: emphasis on second syllable
[2:14:08] TheeCableguy: just means there is a higher chance they will be used
[2:14:09] Wulfknightz: a lot of tcgs a common can be amazing with some high end rarities never being played and be cheap
[2:14:18] the_ginger_nurse: with magic if the rarity is higher its *normally* higher powered or does something extremly good, but its not always the case
[2:14:26] moophoria2008: really nice art

[2:21:33] Kneckt: block is a wonderful feature KEKW
[2:21:35] Birraga: you technically got 3 hits. Players would sell the alt art version to buy the non alts of playable cards
[2:21:37] Novasearch: @kingdaddy96 5$
[2:21:44] Gnerdyy: Kaido might be worth something.
[2:21:53] shinta__: box was ok

[2:22:24] Lordrune13: luffy gear 5 can make everthing rubber that he touchs
[2:22:27] Birraga: Problem with one piece boxes right now is they arent printing in the west as much as Japan.
[2:22:29] Kevron: well, MSRP is $100-110 . its over inflated because they didn't print enough
[2:22:48] danimoto10: you have some worth like 400 bucks
[2:23:02] ambiotic: China buys half the stock sets a price then everyone else follows

[2:23:23] ShowDUH: @xo_navi there's one luffy card signed by Oda yes
[2:23:26] xo_navi: Well they used to be more of toys now they are almost purely collectors
[2:23:27] Birraga: One piece is probably the most hyped TCG atm and the printing for the West is really bad
[2:23:42] YoSaKiZ: camera pixels
[2:23:44] xo_navi: @ShowDUH that's cool, prob why it's so expensive.
[2:23:48] ambiotic: Its the Chinese collectors, they kinda dominate right now
[2:23:49] Kevron: yea , one piece is way under printed right now for demand . boxes are supposed to be 100-110

[2:24:32] willzcc: Manga cards worth a lot as well, and we have manga card is every collection (box)
[2:24:34] shinta__: chase and manga is the problem
[2:24:38] ShowDUH: Japenese boxes are just abondant
[2:24:39] the_ginger_nurse: i think most collectors are going more towards like the blizzard and ecard style, and i think its like that because youre able to ensure you have the cards worth something in a secure location, and if you want them you can have them shipped to you.
[2:24:41] Novasearch: ya scalpers and low prints raising the prices made it realy hard to play casually
[2:24:42] zeeAbe: Just buy singles
[2:24:45] willzcc: in*
[2:24:51] Birraga: The game blew up because of this SET

[2:25:46] ackdogg007: Thats what happaned with Lorcana when it first came out they didnt print enough and they sky rocketed because of it and the game died at the end of the day
[2:25:50] Alaquane: overcooked those boxes by waiting
[2:26:00] the_ginger_nurse: @zeeAbe yup for mtg i would spend 300 on a deck while others were doing thousands in boxes trying to make the same deck

[4:03:27] Kinghorn: yeah there are only 2 foil types, the foil you get in every pack and enchanted
[4:03:34] AdmiralPendragon: people call it cold foil because of Flesh and Blood and because of the foiling process is done at "low" temperatures
[4:03:49] Accoloth: what do you think of lorcana card quality? wasn't that impressed when I opened a pack recently
[4:03:54] Tanaros: I wonder if people actually play this or just collect it
