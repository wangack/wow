[3:55:26] Kinghorn: big daddy sludgey monkaS
[3:55:53] jbwow01: dual wielding still wins in most situations because 2 enchants to 1
[3:56:06] sdpercussion: This decision may be a little more complicated than it first would seem, as there is a hidden buff —called Windwalker Monk Two-Hand Adjustment Icon Windwalker Monk Two-Hand Adjustment despite also affecting Brewmasters — which increases the damage of your abilities by 2% when dual-wielding. However, many of your abilities do not actually take a weapon in the off-hand into account for calculating their damage dealt!
[3:56:47] sdpercussion: What this all ends up meaning is that when dual-wielding, your autoattack damage is greater, but when using a two-handed weapon your ability damage is higher instead. But, if both of your dual-wielded weapons are enchanted, then they can make up this difference in ability damage
[3:56:59] sdpercussion: /end spam

[4:10:53] sdpercussion: the thing that gets me the most is that you're better off farming conq with 1400 rating than running 15's to gear
[4:10:56] sdpercussion: ...

[4:12:02] yokai_5: KEKW
[4:12:32] Gnral: m+ should have a vendor equal to pvp ' 1400 = 8-9 m+ 2100 =14,15 ....
[4:13:06] Kinghorn: I am just happy to have gotten a good vault finally, even if it was just bracers they were bis. the previous 2 weeks were shit PepeWhy
[4:13:06] sdpercussion: instead 1400 is like 12's
[4:13:42] sdpercussion: imagine I lvld and alt and have 197 sanctum gear before he's even done 10's to 200
[4:14:12] Kinghorn: with the new renown cap WQ gear is like 194 now also
[4:14:15] Gnral: amount of conq and m+ anima should be equal for higher diffculty
[4:15:02] sdpercussion: 10's should be slightly less than heroic. 15's slightly more. just like 8.3. that was perfect
[4:15:11] Kinghorn: so between WQ and covenant gear you can get to like 200 ilvl
[4:15:20] sdpercussion: right
[4:15:26] sdpercussion: you get 200 from world content
[4:15:45] sdpercussion: and then have to grind 10's for io before you can get invited to keys that actually drop upgrades
[4:16:15] Wildside1177: yes it is a horrible system
[4:16:17] sdpercussion: like you have to run at least 12's for it to be worth your time aside from io
[4:16:37] Gnral: i'm horde and i ok if blizz buffs ally gearing or give them free gear
[4:16:40] Supers18: @rasury123 Thanks for the gift sub!
