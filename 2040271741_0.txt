[0:30:41] Klutchie: STV is going to be glorious
[0:30:42] SippinSimpSyrup: It’s a pve event and the reason they made it a pve event is because their servers can’t handle large scale pvp, so they know not to make an event around that
[0:30:44] Ragi_Fz: I think it could have easily been solved on the PvP front at least and that's frustrating

[0:35:54] Slappetrask: Its called discovery for a reason lol. Stop complaining
[0:35:56] Exusprime: @EnyoHC they couldnt put the runes in the Barrens if u think about it. its Horde only zones
[0:35:59] Mr_Moffert: OkayMan surely horde priests would just randomly kill elitemobs in redridge

[0:37:17] bwomsam: Only problem phase 1 is : almost no new quest,  no a single new area... sadly
[0:37:20] crazyboy1_: i hope they dont add another gold sink rune tho like the rachet one

[2:56:32] ResentfulUK: @Guzu - You should move your BigWigs / DBM bars when they're shorter off the side, and then make them move to a more noticable area when large. This makes it MUCH easier to see when something urgent is coming, like chains.

[3:35:45] chefboyrkb: its in the game for a reason
[3:35:46] melvinguyy: for everyone and him
[3:35:46] schwiftyhc: lion and bm rune
[3:35:47] Janniwow: Greedy MM hunters usually refuse to use lion for extra crit chance @Guzu
[3:35:48] skrakampf: ofc lion is worth, but he go oom fast
[3:35:49] Rahmulous: Lion is absolutely necessary
[3:35:51] CamGG__: It is worth it, hes trolling @Guzu
[3:35:51] siqqxd: its worth if only hunter
[3:35:52] hiro25000: he is just being selfish
[3:35:52] OptimusBanana420: just another clueless hunter
[3:35:52] Sparkel: what he using atm?
[3:35:55] yami_yugi_87: when there are 2 hunters it may not be worth but solo hunter yes it is
[3:35:57] Xgeonmar: why wouldnt u use lion as horde, ur basically a paladin buff
[3:35:58] Exusprime: why doesnt he admit he doesnt have it
[3:36:01] Tropicocity: @guzu can you inspect and see which rune hes prioritizing?
[3:36:01] ashtaroxx: it's not even close to any other rune for hunter ICANT Lion is insane
[3:36:04] Craigumander: that hunter is scuffed af KEKW
[3:36:04] Eleith: its worth if hes the only hunter @guzu
[3:36:05] Do_Men: with a full melee group, 10% is a lot
[3:36:06] tacofredag90: hes using the tiger today i guess
[3:36:07] Curtsy: Greedy for what? Less dps?
[3:36:09] melvinguyy: you only dont use it if theres another hunter who got lion on
[3:36:12] AvengerDK: 5% crit vs 10% stats for the raid LUL LUL
[3:36:12] gazmetron: Probably just wants to run marksmen rune, greedy
[3:36:13] Foodlebar: it doesnt stack so not worth having multiple hunters run it
[3:36:13] DangerousMusabi: Missing neck I caaaaaaant
[3:36:14] RushedFuq: u have 3 hunter now surely one will do lion
[3:36:15] PHYRN: @Eleith its worth even if theres 2
[3:36:16] yewww: he has 0 logs, he is a sh!t hunter
[3:36:19] SippinSimpSyrup: Pog 10 man
[3:36:21] Laukkak: if you have 2 hunters then one can go 5% crit and one lion
[3:36:22] ClyroTV: NODDERS
[3:36:22] AvengerDK: you really did find a huntard
[3:36:22] mennry2: Hunters never use anytjing else than lion lmfao. Only horde scum does kekw
[3:36:26] Curtsy: @melvinguyy he was the only hunter in the group and wasnt using it
[3:36:31] StreamElements: Sub to the IRL channel NOW! Madge https://www.youtube.com/@Guzu2
[3:36:32] bigsugg: ''rly good hunter'' kekw how can u not be a good hunter

[3:36:37] melvinguyy: @Curtsy i know thats what im saying
[3:36:40] vash61: the fact that he didn’t even unboon is a joke
[3:36:44] raiwist: KKona
[3:36:46] Laukkak: if you have one lion is prio
[3:36:46] playerpersonx: @melvinguyy is 5% crit even worth it over 10% stats tho? it's only 5% crit on multi and arcane shot, not auto shots
[3:36:48] 冂凵乃口: this guy probably doesn't know what is 20% KEKW
[3:36:48] djangojojo: For The Hord!!!
[3:36:49] resume___: @Guzu could you upload yesterday's logs when you can guzuL

[3:37:11] resume___: all good
[3:37:11] Raekthechef: yea you ALWAYS go lion unless you have 2 hunters and you're playing MM - then you can go master marksman, going master marksman with no lion is hardgriefing yourself and the raid
[3:37:16] melvinguyy: @playerpersonx im saying if theres another hunter providing lion
[3:37:20] druidnatorr: Imagine refusing to use Lion as a hunter LOL
[3:37:26] raiwist: lol
[3:37:27] ashtaroxx: SoCute
[3:37:33] ClyroTV: @Raekthechef Exactly this
[3:37:40] playerpersonx: @melvinguyy yes and I'm saying you lose 10% stats because lion gives 10% stat for yourself on top of 10% to the grp
[3:37:46] saltb0mber: and gloves
[3:37:49] Hozitojones: whats in that mug
[3:37:50] Trexbo_: iAsk Guzu for a 5 man wouldnt a Shaman be better than Rogue? A little more healing and also loads of interrupts? I know that would mean replacing Azamous which is no no but still
[3:37:52] playerpersonx: @melvinguyy if you dont use it yourself you lose 10% stats
[3:38:02] Xgeonmar: this boss is dropping the 2h sword
[3:38:12] nzcorona: Poor hunter probably shouldn't have done that infront of 3k ppl but hey
[3:38:12] Destroy_Me_DADDY: I knew these Bozos couldnt 4 men last boss

[3:38:35] melvinguyy: @playerpersonx bro learn to read. ONLY USE CRIT RUNE IF THERES ANOTHER HUNTER PROVIDING LION xd
[3:38:50] Craigumander: @Guzu take a poll on what hunter tops? Kappa
[3:38:52] Trexbo_: Yeah thats true the pump is real

[3:41:17] BrynjarTheLost: I think Devastate is fine it’s the Talwar that’s busted.
[3:41:21] hoognetty: @Guzu 4 man is doable with a hunter
[3:41:26] melvinguyy: @32yearslateralex yes i know this, as mm its still better with crit rune if another hunter got lion
[3:41:26] maxwell_rs3: if they remove trade between 2 players and only leave auction would it remove gold selling
[3:41:28] Drhaxx12: @Guzu Hey, what % do you have your raid frames, can you show?

[3:42:36] ashtaroxx: plink yo phanti
[3:42:39] ashtaroxx: ChipiChapa
[3:42:49] playerpersonx: @melvinguyy I dont think it is tbh. using lion yourself with good gear in BFD gives ~40 RAP and 1.5% crit for ALL shots including auto shot. marksman just gives 5% crit on yellow shots
[3:42:49] jtk13: COPIUM

[3:43:49] Mac_Dubh: Meanwhile I havent had a single set piece drop on my Warrior i mained since Sod launch. The joys of pugging
[3:43:54] Slyxen: they didn't want to show off too much LUL
[3:43:57] ashtaroxx: plunk hopefully this gear sticks to atleast lvl 32
[3:44:01] saren_x: as soon as we go we go YEP

[3:44:07] mordiell: if you need me to come on my mage to make up for all the dps, let me know
[3:44:12] Joaxx: All that gear and still 7 skill in bows Sadge
[3:44:12] OddM4nOut: yall need more hunters? bla
[3:44:16] playerpersonx: @bazzzzzzz we're talking about if another hunter uses lion for you tho, so im not sure its so clear. I still think the 10% stats might be better than marksman
[3:44:21] hylzan: master loot guzu
[3:44:31] billytheman666: @playerpersonx I gain about 56 rap and I dinged yesterday, I did get Artemis, xbow and trinket tho.

[3:44:57] BiggieBoyZ: Akumai was too hard as 4?
[3:44:59] ashtaroxx: plink so who is getting the 2h sword on this raid?
