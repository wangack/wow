[1:47:54] cripplious: @jaygutta504 yes belf
[1:48:03] king_julian_96: nah all you read in that leak can still happen towelieevjust have a 10.3 to take care of the iridikron and the other plot point
[1:48:15] xsp00n: that would be a mega xpac, or a 2 part xpac
[1:48:37] Zivs: well Ion basically soft confirmed a world update will happen, we just duno when
[1:48:44] Valseki: yea - thats a world revamp
[1:48:50] Zivs: ye
[1:48:55] falldrgn: but that would cost us a raid  teir
[1:48:57] falldrgn: *tier
[1:49:08] XLcoj: Hmm only the eastern? susipicious
[1:49:08] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:49:14] xsp00n: we arent getting 10.3 we already lost a tier lol
[1:49:15] falldrgn: but the graphics can be done over time
[1:49:15] dracullus: but.. why. it's literally side content only transmog hunters play
[1:49:18] comp1: Wintersprings needs help in the graphic
[1:49:24] mavericks312: It’s 100% a graphical revamp
[1:49:25] Valseki: thats insane - no reason for blizz to do that - wouldnt be worth it for them
[1:49:28] crymeog: they already did a world revamp, people should know it doesnt work that way
[1:49:40] crymeog: how many times has stormwind be changed

[1:49:43] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Wait, so 10.3 is coming out then? Pog
[1:49:45] xsp00n: oh i dont mean cut, this guy in chat just said that the revamp would cost us a tier
[1:49:45] strike879: they could still do a revamp just not a full on everything at once like cata they could do a few zones with each patch
[1:49:47] Thoreya: sooo maybe 2 year expacs will not be anymore?
[1:49:52] Poriand: No content cut? No player housing lol
[1:49:53] Thoreya: bc if its still 2 years eh
[1:50:00] mavericks312: 10.3 is most likely the fates season
[1:50:04] Melonbrew: Make all dungeons M+ but only 8 certain ones each season give rating. Rest are for fun or maybe some leaderboards
[1:50:12] xziyn: Feels like it's something they should have announced with DF, honestly
[1:50:26] dracullus: we get extra zone instead of 4th raid, compare all content from patches from each expansion and it's clear
[1:50:26] Eshel: Epilogue patch - wrap up the story and lay ground work for the next
[1:50:30] Milanesa_De_Pollo: What's the reason for going down a patch?
[1:50:57] mavericks312: They literally showed u a road map what lol
[1:51:08] Thoreya: i feel like bfa had 1000x more content
[1:51:15] falldrgn: I think they want annual xpacs. they don't want extreme droughts like we had with SoO and Shadowlands
[1:51:23] xziyn: You lose content compared to BfA and legion, just in raid bosses and dungeons alone
[1:51:33] dracullus: imo expac should release around August to avoid any drought - 5/6 months for season 4, 2/3 months for fated season
[1:51:43] muztho: never forgive them for making us do arena for the bis neck thing conflict and strife was it
[1:51:44] crymeog: I still havent gotten my heriloom ring, from that faction
[1:51:46] ArcaneSyntax: BFA had soooooo much system bloat
[1:51:47] crymeog: LUL
[1:51:51] Beerplz: @Towelliee might be true but the content we got was all reskinned "invasions" where it wants you to kill X mobs for Y rewards , which kind of makes it boring i guess ?
[1:52:04] jaygutta504: can u get tier from dungeons now
[1:52:04] mavericks312: Bfa had more content but wasn’t as well received like DF was
[1:52:10] Tydiian: Tydiian subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:52:13] XLcoj: siege of ogrimar
[1:52:15] crymeog: i put up with a real world trans auction in d3
[1:52:27] Zettabyte: towHi
[1:52:34] robbo1010: people will complain about anything
[1:52:35] mavericks312: If you didn’t play between wrath and legion you don’t know droughts
[1:52:47] 91Niki: I think the most we would see in old zones is D3 type content with world quests that you turn in for the cache at the end
[1:52:52] DallTV_: damn i wish wow comunity is not toxic :(
[1:52:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: 4 months amateurs
[1:52:53] xziyn: I'd rather have one more raid tier and like 1-2 more dungeons as opposed to stuff like dreamsurges
[1:52:57] karrlor: karrlor subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[1:53:00] crymeog: it was a good attempt at a new business model, but i think we all knew that d3 real auction house was gonna fail
[1:53:10] 91Niki: That’s how they made old zones in D3 relevant
[1:53:19] Thoreya: 8.2 and 8.3 will forever be my favorite patches, never played wow so much lol
[1:53:24] Eshel: Remember that long ass drought they called WoD ? Lmao
[1:53:26] Melonbrew: I actually miss BFA. Best dungeons and loved corruption
[1:53:42] mavericks312: @thoreya because you were basically forced to play lol
[1:53:45] xziyn: Didn't legion have a better patch cadence though?
[1:54:16] xziyn: It did taper off by the end yeah
[1:54:26] Thoreya: @mavericks312 meh, dont mind having a reason to log in
[1:54:26] Gruffian: MoP drought was loooong
[1:54:34] ArcaneSyntax: Karazhan mega dungeon was like 4 weeks into the expansion, it was insane
[1:54:57] Milanesa_De_Pollo: So you're saying there's a chance we get a Tinker next expansion?
[1:55:00] magemaster225: do you believe nothing was cut in SL
[1:55:06] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite anniesWrite
[1:55:12] mavericks312: @thoreya an that’s cool but for me I like playing WoW for 3 days and then playing some console games the rest of the week without missing anything in wow
[1:55:15] crymeog: if blizzard didnt do the world revamp ect, what lvl would we all be? 140? 160?
[1:55:28] Milanesa_De_Pollo: What about the Drust raid?
[1:55:29] dracullus: still legion had no new zone, reused broken shore in 7.2 and big zone (split into 3) in 7.3, DF had that by 10.1
[1:55:33] Milanesa_De_Pollo: There was no Drust story.
[1:55:39] xziyn: Didn't you use to say they absolutely did lol?
[1:55:46] xsp00n: the last 4 bosses of SL straight up felt like a different raid
[1:55:59] Eshel: Shadowlands cut the entire point of the story lol
[1:55:59] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[1:56:37] dracullus: SL had droughts after 9.0 and 9.1, but after 9.1.5 it had really good schedule and I think DF should have same post 10.2
[1:56:40] xziyn: I prefer believeing that they cut a tier in SL as opposed to their writers being that incompetent
[1:56:42] king_julian_96: What you mean would of had a .3? Patch in SL if we didn’t have Covid
[1:56:46] xeavv: Think they are just moving on to 11.0 to fix some of the class issues+healing issues that they didnt address? Seems like they can only rework 1/2 specs a tier
[1:57:04] Eshel: Covid-lands - the “we better give them something before they riot” xpac
[1:57:20] mavericks312: @king_julian_96 we did have a .3 patch basically with the fated season
[1:57:20] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[1:57:58] xsp00n: but how do you have content to cut , but such long droughts?
[1:58:04] xsp00n: 13months of HFC
[1:58:07] duffluv22: Morning chat. Saw MrGms Tweet. Said times to threaten a mans family over a video game. Prayers for him and his family.
[1:58:10] ArcaneSyntax: A lot of y'all don't really understand how wow's development cycle works.
[1:59:09] Metket: who would threat ptr guy LUL
[1:59:10] Eshel: “Gogogo” - that’s Latin for “hey, let’s wipe” LOL
[1:59:48] duffluv22: @metket exactly
[2:00:26] mavericks312: Yea I don’t get the mrgm hate all of a sudden
[2:01:03] xziyn: @mavericks312 Stupid streamer/YTer drama
[2:01:27] Eshel: Geesh - threatening people over a video game … “ask your doctor if Xanax is right for you ..”
[2:01:27] raldrik: numbers go brrrrr
[2:01:53] KaisenSiru: WAYTOODANK
[2:01:55] xziyn: Good thing you don't have epilepsy wtf

[2:02:30] l3bioda: Towelliee Greetings from POLAND
[2:02:45] Morepowerx: MrGM is a standup guy. How could he be getting heat like that? Someone jealous? Good career, beautiful new family, sounds like someone’s jealous to me

[2:03:53] duffluv22: @morepowerx Agreed
[2:04:03] DunzoCD: @Morepowerx definitely just a jealous creator that decides to hate instead of putting in work to make his content better
[2:05:19] Yeolbootz: the buff can fall off certain people if they arnt in range
[2:05:45] spectraaa: healers and casters get inf mana
[2:06:14] KaisenSiru: Sadge
[2:06:25] spectraaa: because nobody does full runs anymore
[2:06:41] duffluv22: I know m9st leave when they ding 70
[2:06:50] magemaster225: yeah most people just do the gauntlet and last boss here
[2:06:54] Eshel: Leave culture is toxic af
[2:07:05] Yeolbootz: 210 for gammas
[2:07:34] Yeolbootz: you can pull that boss with you all the way to keep the buff
[2:08:39] mayonaes: Been thinking about coming back to retail to raid how bad is catchup right now?

[2:12:42] crymeog: i honestly enjoyed large scale pvp in shadowlands, and even dragonflight, if they could attach long term rewards from big arena pvp matchs like AV i mean
[2:12:49] smashwow: we got a solid maybe some day on housing. with zero timeline. if they were interested in doing it. they would have made it happen by now. sub numbers are good enough i guess Kappa
[2:13:07] crymeog: i know rep grinds are -_- but having a reward system in the large scale pvp would be nice
[2:13:10] duffluv22: Some of the older dungeons are actually pretty good
[2:13:46] emarol_dk: I hope so
[2:13:47] Thoreya: oh boy
[2:13:51] AvrithSATX: towCopium
[2:13:53] Thoreya: clip it and ship

[2:14:26] xsp00n: i guess evoker?
[2:14:31] Sarocus: luxthoNews  Streamer leaks 11.0 featrures ahead of convention. More at 11
[2:14:32] PokerFaceMoose: it only took 2 decades
[2:14:33] PotbellyGoat: housing would be huge
[2:14:36] Thoreya: we lost 9.3 and 10.3 for player housing
[2:14:38] Thoreya: pog
[2:14:48] Milanesa_De_Pollo: You won't need housing once they merge WoW and ESO together since they will be both under Microsoft
[2:14:50] EpicJune: housing is great side content
[2:14:54] Hamners: They do housing , add some Siege warfare, and new BGs we be in a good place
[2:15:09] veryhairyheyyall: towCopium
[2:15:22] RagingPunk: different houses in different zones maybe would be cool
[2:15:51] herzlustafir: wall mounted boss heads would be awsome things like that.
[2:16:16] HaxzorJimDuggan: imagine it, send tell for house inspection before doing a mythic +
[2:16:17] AvrithSATX: I wouldn't mind housing like New World has with Trophies that can add power, but mostly just cosmetic/collector stuff.
[2:16:28] HaloS23: @Towelliee just sounds like Garrisons 2.0 to me

[2:16:32] brewbrewbear: sounds a bit like garrisons tbh
[2:16:43] DaFinalRagnarok: that would lead to boosting so much though
[2:16:52] DaFinalRagnarok: unless it has to be a guild only group
[2:16:58] Eshel: My biggest concern would be how it affected city hubs - maybe if trade chat didn’t work in player housing or something
[2:17:12] whiskytrix: eh, but what if you could have killed a boss without it and its just one boss that is overtuned
[2:17:13] dracullus: Iridikron: "damn son, that's awesome house" *dies*
[2:17:17] ergolucky: HAPPY
[2:17:17] herzlustafir: and carries thru expantions and that could be good for pvp dots aswell
[2:17:18] Starlight_Veil: I'd rather it be like FF14 housing. Cool to have one, but not gonna affect you in anyway if you don't have one
[2:17:27] Eshel: People don’t leave their real homes anymore - don’t let them become hermits online too lmao
[2:17:28] EpicJune: i can already hear people complaining LUL

[2:18:35] ergolucky: @haxzorjimduggan towShy towSip towBeer towHesaidit
[2:18:43] xsp00n: @duffluv22 you can get exalted in like 3hrs now

[2:20:02] dracullus: guild halls are most bizzare concept people talk about, what would your guild even do there? xD
[2:20:05] mavericks312: 6ers lowkey robbed the clippers
[2:20:12] FUBARtastic: he was traded from the clippers to sixers
[2:20:13] PokerFaceMoose: the player no one can stand  after 1 season
[2:20:13] MattyNiceTV: nope, hadn't been there yet
[2:20:21] MyerHQ: Like j watch nba
[2:20:24] DunzoCD: harden was never worth the money imo
[2:20:34] mavericks312: Possibly 3 1sts and good role players for a guy who is gonna request a trade agin next year
[2:20:35] xsp00n: @dracullus what would we even do in garrisons? class halls? major citie?
[2:20:48] MattyNiceTV: now the clippers will have 3 stars that don't play more than 50 games
[2:20:51] ergolucky: Slovenian beast towHesaidit Luka Fucking Doncic
[2:21:00] duffluv22: Mission tables...lol

[2:53:30] crymeog: bad core, or your thermal paste isnt seated right anymore
[2:53:51] duffluv22: Cleaning?
[2:53:56] herzlustafir: wonder if we get sweden map on overwatch this Con
[2:53:57] MabusGaming: It is normal for one core to run hotter than others
[2:54:07] crymeog: well it could be a single process that is being utalized
[2:54:11] Sollice: I am surprised your using NVENC
[2:54:25] crymeog: somes tiems, if a process is allocated to a individual core
[2:54:44] MabusGaming: nvenc is way superior to cpu
[2:55:07] Sollice: @MabusGaming Ehh when you have a threadripper and can do slow

[2:56:42] MabusGaming: are you using nvidia nvenc hevc or h.264? might get less stutter on hevc, but then again if it's been running fine up until now could be hard to diagnose lol
[2:56:44] CeruleanStar: can't you lame a core or put wow on an affinity to a single core ?
[2:56:53] Eshel: 1-800-OriginPC lol
[2:57:08] CeruleanStar: also, i am like 99.999 certain wow does *not* multithread so /shrug
[2:57:09] Sollice: @CeruleanStar he ndis to a stream pc
[2:57:28] Sollice: see it?
[2:57:39] CeruleanStar: ah the streaming pc is having trouble
[2:57:49] raldrik: it started for me in the new world marathon
[2:57:54] MabusGaming: that definitely looks like GPU encoding issue, weird
[2:58:03] gimmlay: I got the real leak lol K’aresh.  We got that random coin quest for a reason. We need to help them retake their homeland in order to weaken the void and have them teach us how to fight the void lords. There is a map and lore that was leaked 5yrs ago.
[2:58:05] Sollice: @Towelliee This has been happening for a few weeks and you see it mostly when you are doing some sort of action on the screen
[2:58:23] CeruleanStar: i just got here so i'll pay attention lol

[3:00:28] mackieeswe: still there
[3:00:28] CeruleanStar: no no it defijnitely blipped
[3:00:32] LeDerpski: nah it stuttered
[3:00:42] CeruleanStar: again
[3:01:01] HaloS23: Debug stream INC!!!
[3:01:32] MabusGaming: if you're using NDI could be video card, could be latency between network, many factors unfortunately ;/
[3:01:33] Snabido: Atleast it aint Pit of Saron

[3:03:10] N3llee: I'm telling you that last nvid driver update missed up a ton of people on various pc specs
[3:03:12] MattyjTV: IF it is happening on your gaming computer, it could be a graphics, other wise 100% stream pc
[3:03:37] dracullus: classic microsoft
[3:04:04] CeruleanStar: i just found the level of play in those duels to be so far beyond me it was impressive lol
[3:04:05] LeetSauce_TV: kinda unbearable to watch with the stutter >.>
[3:04:08] Sollice: I think the last driver required a restart so you would probably have to restart stream pc
[3:04:26] Sollice: @dracullus Whats this to do with MS lol

[3:05:31] magemaster225: ICC dungeons dont have affixes
[3:05:36] Lefty79: Not in any of the new 3.
[3:05:40] Sollice: @snake_like There is no driver today. Its weird its a studio driver showing up for some reason
[3:05:45] PhillyRhino: No affixes for the new dungeons
[3:05:48] Sollice: The regular driver was available a few days ago
[3:06:12] Sollice: @snake_like I lied sorry you are right
[3:06:18] Sollice: My GeForce Experience was messed up
[3:06:22] magemaster225: yeah evryone just ques forge for dailies
[3:06:22] snake_like: Version 546.01?
[3:06:24] snake_like: oh ok
[3:06:28] CeruleanStar: yeah regarding the stutter - if it's only on stream pc - it's unlikely to do with the sending/recieving of the AV but more the encoding/uploading of the stream pc - i'd just start with a reboot there and maybe a monitor to see where it's blipping -- also wonder if it's some bullshit microsoft service like the anti-malware service that i've seen cause stutters
[3:06:36] PhillyRhino: Gamma is considered on par with the new dungeons difficulty wise according to blizz
[3:06:45] gimmlay: See the stage leaks? Man there are more leaks about the wow stage in mmo champion. It’s definitely void themed… we are 100% going to K’aresh

[3:16:11] Gravy_Gator: I think it would be funny if all these leaks were planned by blizzard and we get bamboozled at blizzcon with something completely different. They played us all along
[3:16:13] yohover: the thought process (to them) is that it makes it seem less likely to be fake if they take a real life picture
[3:16:19] smashwow: you gotta have a burner phone for this type of recon Kappa

[3:17:31] Thoreya: @thomssone imo the Avaloren leak seems legit
[3:17:41] Conn93: yeah cause otherwise they'd need weeks of access to the con center surely?
[3:17:48] MoodyVanessa: that logo looks cool
[3:17:52] rbgdev: No way people out here evaluating if a box is AI lol

[3:18:29] DunzoCD: tree roots?
[3:18:31] rymerre: WoW: Tentacles
[3:18:33] Asuo_: Is that the roots of the new world tree maybe?
[3:18:34] ChrisBakis: i think a light expansion with tyralion maybe bad guy and after void expansion with sargeras and illidan coming to save us:)
[3:18:36] smashwow: tree roots
[3:18:48] majixeightythree: probably their new survival game
[3:18:50] Ch0p_Su3y: i miss portals being the login screen

[3:22:19] zorpotv: good morning bro
[3:22:36] geokouts: they should have put WoW expantion near end like Nov 4

[3:22:45] S1appadabass: S1appadabass subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 61 months! 
[3:22:46] Akermay: Think the post is suggesting a secret panel in between
[3:23:01] rymerre: is there no sunday stuff?
[3:23:04] MizixTV: There’s probably a panel after the opening ceremony they are hiding from the schedule
[3:23:07] Codeblue2023: no real q&a this year either :(
[3:23:13] Gravy_Gator: Panel about a panel
[3:23:27] Codeblue2023: so no red shirt guy this year
[3:23:31] dracullus: it would have to be survival game, for diablo expac they would just do diablo what's next

[3:24:52] N3llee: usually they have new ip panels on the list they just mask the name
[3:25:07] mavericks312: OW 2 only has to announce a 2nd tank spot again then leave stage
[3:25:15] MabusGaming: darkmoon faire and stuff used to be on level 2

[3:26:58] digaboom: OW is still their biggest esport
[3:26:59] MabusGaming: where do i get my $20 pretzle
[3:27:00] digaboom: gotta respect
[3:27:01] CeruleanStar: turns out p3 is a huge OW fan and bought AVB just to turn it around
[3:27:02] SamuraiWillZ916: have they just given up on star craft?

[3:29:16] Zettabyte: Overwatch 3, @Towelliee Kappa
[3:29:16] rymerre: im in the camp that the new IP isnt ready to even announce
[3:29:25] Eshel: “How do we hide the new IP?” …. “Just make one another Overwatch - they’ll never figure it out” LOL
[3:29:27] zorpotv: are you going to blizzcon in person or watching the livestream?
[3:29:28] Malarick: StarCraft 3
[3:29:29] Vch001: Overwatch movie?
[3:29:30] CloosterFlook: hopefully making tanks better cause they are super squishy
[3:29:34] N3llee: OW3
[3:29:35] CeruleanStar: yeah this feels really dumb - but also wouldn't put it passed them
[3:29:40] Starlight_Veil: seems like they are pushing OW if this is true. Kinda odd they'd put both Hearthstone and WoW in the same room. I get they are connected in a way but still
[3:29:44] Rastalynn: Overwatch Survival
[3:29:54] Armdel: releasing a overwatch single player game POGGERS

[3:31:01] coldhandsbeatz: I remember in a Bellular stream he said he got from reputable sources that some really bad news were going to happen during Blizzcon. Maybe no survival and they cancelled it?

[3:33:24] Menion01: This is like Blizzcon lite…

[3:35:57] Shatraugh: artifact weapons were dope
[3:35:57] TheRealAxiom: bonus rolls!
[3:35:59] mccandlessmike: The Mak HmGhora tournament is easily the coolest thing to happen to WoW in ages
[3:36:01] SphinxyOCE: artifact weapons for sure
[3:36:07] zorpotv: ray tracing look good out in the world. only lag be in dalaran
[3:36:14] Bernardo994: combat rogue
[3:36:14] Starlight_Veil: about 43 mins left until you can play
[3:36:18] buhtterstick: do they still have pet battles
[3:36:38] SinicalDev: I think having missives like with crafted gear would be cool
[3:37:18] joe_theviking: And garrisons essentially laying the foundation for housing
[3:37:22] Xoyzor: me :)
[3:37:28] dracullus: forget even class halls, most important is having class content
[3:37:32] gimmlay: Bring back the grind lol
[3:37:45] zorpotv: yea but in wotlk resilience dont help damage like vers does now, so you have to choose between resil pvp piece for defense or pve gear with more offensive stats sacrificing resilience
[3:37:47] Gravy_Gator: reforging was a good system that was tied down by hit/expertise. Now that hit and expertise don't exist reforging would be a great system.
[3:37:51] geokouts: bring back mission table!
[3:38:04] N3llee: pssh game so laggy now servers would be offline for a week
[3:38:05] gimmlay: Garrison
[3:38:21] MrBr1ghtsid3: Speaking of Hot Chocolate, I could do with a coffee right about now. towSip
[3:38:21] MrGattz: yeah and it will never be a good source again because of it
[3:38:24] coldhandsbeatz: Yeah it was completely ok

[3:38:32] tumtillion: tumtillion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:38:33] cordawg: Making Gold like that is bad for the game
[3:38:37] crymeog: lol guys, the funny thing is, alot of the stuf fhte community asked to put in wow, got turned into spin offs haha
[3:38:42] rbolude: and you didnt need to use it at all if you didnt like it
[3:38:45] NiteshadezTV: hot take but that's why gold is almost useless though
[3:38:46] kingpoker: Order Halls and spec quests
[3:38:58] crymeog: like wasnt dota a warcraft 2 mod
[3:38:58] zorpotv: mission table was ultimate gold farm in legion
[3:38:59] Willens_: @cordawg wow token
[3:39:03] mlewis4011: gold, occasional pets, and you needed to still get on the game to get more resources
[3:39:08] DunzoCD: money printing in garrisons was real LUL
[3:39:09] zorpotv: but it hella inflated the auction economy
[3:39:09] coldhandsbeatz: Legion was just amazing, even with all its problems. I hope they can pull another Legion-level expansion with some lessons learned through these years
[3:39:11] geokouts: 100-500g each mission will be fine :)
[3:39:12] DRS8Sonic: yep

[3:39:21] bottis96: BOOM
[3:39:26] WytChapp: i had no family who played wow til i started at 22
[3:39:26] Gravy_Gator: The garrison would have been cool if the stuff in it would send you out into the world to do things. The garrison should have been where you started and ended your play session, everything in between is outside of the garrison.
[3:39:26] MattyNiceTV: my kid is more interested in minecraft than wow
[3:39:32] OrionStarzGamer: Story of my life lol
[3:39:33] dkapocalypse: my sisters kid wants to play wow
[3:39:40] WoWRoach: Ran some timewalking yesterday with my 10 year old daughter.
[3:39:41] zorpotv: legion mission table broke the economy
[3:39:48] autumnrain58: I've played since Vanilla and I'm 65 now

[3:40:47] N3llee: think about in reverse it would bring new players to the game pass
[3:41:01] WytChapp: @chico_escuela kids these days smh

[3:41:44] coldhandsbeatz: Shadowlands was the fastest selling PC game at the time. The problem is they marketed the games too well and then the game was so bad. Now theres a lot of ppl that its just almost impossible to have them back playing
[3:41:45] xziyn: Eh, all online do a terrible job at that, I don't think teenagers have issues with 3rd party websites
[3:41:46] Starlight_Veil: so how that even work on game pass? Pay 15 dollars for that, 15 dollars for the sub to WoW+expansions
[3:41:52] WytChapp: idk every loves Fallout and Skyrim mods whats the difference with addons
[3:41:53] Codeblue2023: beside the rumble toys will there be more crossover to WoW - in other words will there be in game wow benefit to play rumble
[3:41:58] KingSlayerYotam: true
[3:41:59] dracullus: next expac starting point will be DF
[3:42:02] autumnrain58: autumnrain58 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Thiefrider! They have given 3 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:42:06] TheRealAxiom: I mean watch one 10min video on a class you wanna play and I think anyone can pick it up
[3:42:08] rymerre: yeah not having all the past stuff be relevant isnt helping either
[3:42:09] Polarisss_: I feel like that all depends on how involved the parent is?
[3:42:09] zorpotv: only cool kids will play wow just like us. and laugh at all the cod/ fortnite playing kids
[3:42:10] dracullus: you dont need to know anything from older expacs
[3:42:15] herzlustafir: is that a dog? what was that
[3:42:29] Thoreya: i kinda disagree a lot with the boss mechanics and complex rotations lol
[3:42:30] Thiefrider: @autumnrain58  TY
[3:42:31] Eshel: Watch newcomers chat … they can’t figure out /wave - much less raid mechanics lmao
[3:42:40] Thoreya: younger people would be more inclined to withstand that ish
[3:42:41] zorpotv: bro wait til them little kids watch a sick pvp montage of clapping noobs cheeks
[3:42:45] exiled__93: wildstar was goat
[3:42:45] zorpotv: then they like yoooo i wana be like him!
[3:42:47] autumnrain58: @Thiefrider Your welcome
[3:42:52] Starlight_Veil: I mean I am a new player and yeah it's odd they way they handled that. It's like buying a book but instead of starting on page 1 you open to 121 and start reading there
[3:42:55] PokerFaceMoose: wows combat is so smooth, really
[3:42:55] rymerre: thats the problem thou...its still tab targeting lol
[3:42:58] WytChapp: @Eshel my goal when i started playing this year was to get the F out of that as fast as i could
[3:42:58] ThorH13: Do you think they should do another cata?
[3:43:01] KingSlayerYotam: @TheRealAxiom No one gonna research how to play a game this days, if you cant learn from the game itself younger crowd wont stay
[3:43:02] amaceika: It would be nice for them to start new.
[3:43:17] SamuraiWillZ916: the combat is what brings me back every expansion
[3:43:24] zorpotv: when them kids see a sick rogue 2v1 some kids in arena they gona be like yoooo i wana be like that
[3:43:24] coldhandsbeatz: Theres so many ppl that want WoW changed but arent really going to play either way. They just like to complain about what the game should be
[3:43:28] Swizzaman: 43 here. Been playing since closed beta.
[3:43:31] bottis96: both my boys play but my youngest I have to show things all the time in game has very little for new players. Rushes them to endgame without really learning how to play the game
[3:43:32] Wulfgrym: facts
[3:43:34] mlewis4011: Started in 2005, my 9 year old loves watching me play
[3:43:35] amaceika: @ThorH13 I think they should just start fresh. Completely new game new lore.
[3:43:35] jskillz777: hope they give 20 percent xp
[3:43:37] OrionStarzGamer: They should have an option for new and returning plAyers
[3:43:37] crymeog: So if wow got put on a game pass, and it was cross platform, would more people play i t
[3:43:38] unowncreature: They should have made it where new players get sent to Dragon isle at least there you are just on a exploratory mission.
[3:43:39] jskillz777: for 20 years
[3:43:45] oticai: wow's combat is very latency tolerant as well
[3:43:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: my classic guild at one point had the son of a girl that played in my vanilla guild and they both played classic
[3:43:47] WytChapp: i mean my uncle played it but i was never allowed near his pc to watch him play i grew up watching soda you and ducksauce for wow content on twitch

[3:45:08] exteezy20: started playing wow at 8 yo now im 21
[3:45:09] Vch001: Sailing? This is nt Runescape LUL
[3:45:14] Snabido: Dynamic sailing which is slower than flying, surely
[3:45:16] ladymissalice: They ban alts
[3:45:18] DunzoCD: pirates is blacklisted KEKW
[3:45:20] MMokuin: Sailing? Runescape Pog
[3:45:20] Clicklesly: MMO Champion wants to cover up the truth Kappa
[3:45:20] Jango_: probably banned for other reasons
[3:45:21] Elff11: LUL
[3:45:23] Elff11: Im done

[3:45:29] bypized: PIRATES
[3:45:30] ladymissalice: So that person made an alt to post that leak instead of posting on main
[3:45:31] gimmlay: Dynamic flying mech suits with combat
[3:45:33] zombie_snacks666: Started with warcraft 3 when I was 11, gonna be 33 next year
[3:45:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: eventually the pain always wins
[3:45:39] Burnski: if they didn't have sailing in BFA they're not gonna have it now
[3:45:41] raldrik: dynamic sailing with captain doodle druid
[3:45:42] dkapocalypse: play the song , still play wow
[3:45:44] CeruleanStar: i bet they have logging too and tree felling is very satisfying

[3:46:14] Wulfgrym: got an error, paid for it and all, didn't get it
[3:46:15] bypized: BOATRIDING ABILITIES @towelliee
[3:46:18] CeruleanStar: WC1 was so good and bad, but WC2 was legit a masterpiece at the time
[3:46:33] Vch001: "Take it to the Council!"
[3:46:34] DunzoCD: i put so many hours as a kid into WC2 and 3
[3:46:45] zombie_snacks666: My step mom was a huge warcraft player with her brothers, so growing up there was always Lan parties at our house. Got me hooked at an early age

[3:47:39] MabusGaming: I played Warcraft 3 - and when I bought Frozen Throne on the disc they had a teaser for WoW, and I didn't understand it since I never did an MMO before haha.
[3:47:44] Captaincorybod: captai387Dragonpuffer captai387Dragonpuffer captai387Dragonpuffer captai387Dragonpuffer captai387Dragonpuffer captai387Dragonpuffer
[3:47:45] CeruleanStar: the main issue between the stories of WC2/3 and modern wow -- today they are too cowardly to kill off characters or introduce new, good characters - so we just get recycled the same people over and over and over and nothing really changes ? all new characters just die ?
[3:48:21] mavericks312: @ceruleanstar new characters don’t sell though
[3:48:25] Vch001: "That would be a dark timeline"
[3:48:33] Starlight_Veil: LUL
[3:48:35] Snabido: CoD vs BF, those were the days CoolCat
[3:48:44] gimmlay: What do you think of mechs like those on Argus.. except these will be dynamic flying and also used for combat in the sky.. fully customizable
[3:48:44] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:48:50] Wulfgrym: @Vch001 KEKW
[3:48:51] PotbellyGoat: Air Force dorms in '99 we were playing EQ1 and then WoW
[3:49:01] Swizzaman: WoW needs a Thanos snap story wise
[3:49:05] mavericks312: Towel would be all adderalled up playing apex lol
[3:49:09] propoopimus: who cares
[3:49:22] dannyis1337: hes saying twitch didnt pay him at all but all the twitch streamers called him out
[3:49:25] MattyNiceTV: he told people he didn't get sub revenue, even though he was getting a MG that was the same if not more
[3:49:25] mavericks312: Nickmercs made it seem like he wasn’t making any money
[3:49:31] bypized: Take the bag, that’s all I say
[3:49:39] mccandlessmike: WoW needs to be wiped clean. Retail is unrecognizable to me now
[3:49:52] MabusGaming: basically the drama is people subbing thinking the money would go to nickmercs but it didn't because he had a deal with twitch, so it went to twitch basically
[3:50:03] DunzoCD: @mccandlessmike that seems like a you problem not a game problem
[3:50:04] ambiotic: he just wanted to justify going to kick
[3:50:09] Snabido: Happens when you take a break in vanilla and coming back first now 😏
[3:50:14] TweektheProphet: he has just been upset at twitch for awhile and is just trying to make people upset like him
[3:50:24] WytChapp: @MabusGaming was he just not allowed to say the money was all going to twitch ?
[3:50:25] Moobot: For 10% off go to -> https://gameradvantage.com/?ref=TOWEL or use code "TOWEL" at checkout!
[3:50:27] mavericks312: He wanted to justify his gambling streams announcement
[3:51:03] foghagymatyi: He just wants to gamble LOL
[3:51:15] mccandlessmike: @dunzocd yeah maybe. I love how people in Twitch chats are so salty 🧂
[3:51:27] flxchoppa: U have rich followers
[3:51:41] aesirsghost: 2 mil on top of the subs or is sub payout included in that?
[3:51:54] prophitmoffett: a guarantee
[3:52:02] JoshuaTree6969: so he has to gamble, meaning theyre including funds for it
[3:52:05] Starlight_Veil: oh I didn't know that. I figured twitch paid out monthly to streamers
[3:52:13] mavericks312: He had to buy a house outside of the states though to do the gambling streams he said
[3:52:22] MattyNiceTV: nah. I have a friend that got in the second wave of their hourly pay partner thing and he doesn't have to gamble at all
[3:52:25] Theduskflyer: Contacts should be public. Stream, esports teams, etc.
[3:52:26] aesirsghost: Oh okay.
[3:52:26] CeruleanStar: so honestly the main issue iwth the writing today is everything is made like 'lost' they dont' actually have any idea what the answer/end ot the story is or should be, they just want to try and build the suspense/tension and 'figure ito ut later'
[3:53:02] Starlight_Veil: yeah it makes sense
[3:53:03] Ertra: vaults aren't for 27 mins anyways
[3:53:07] WytChapp: retail has taken forever last two weeks
[3:53:08] jskillz777: Na isn't up yet
[3:53:18] piiles: @Towelliee Do you think they'll ever make a wow 2. Like brand new engine with modern graphics?
[3:53:24] Wulfgrym: makes perfect sense
[3:53:30] Animemron: @Towelliee how did you get the sylvanas pack to appear in the shop in warcraft rumble? I dont have it in mine :(
[3:53:40] Starlight_Veil: and also that was quick. Said downtime was an hour and it's been around 30 mins
[3:53:41] mavericks312: @piiles no there is nothing wrong with there graphics or engine
[3:53:48] CeruleanStar: sylvanas is an exammple of that bad writing - they just made her all mysteriously evil for 'reasons' -- well when they reasons came to light, it was really dumb, because thoese reasons didnt' exist until years later when they decided to figure it out
[3:53:59] ambiotic: That just sounds like a commission based job to me lol
[3:53:59] Moobot: Towelliee is participating in the Warcraft Rumblemania Blizzcon event on November 3rd! Make sure your tuning in to cheer on your favorite streamer. Check out the announcement video at https://x.com/WarcraftRumble/status/1717980850346766567?s=20
[3:53:59] palatus1: what do you need to start streaming?
[3:54:05] Wulfgrym: pro tip: talk to your agent before making an ass of yourself on line
[3:54:09] piiles: @mavericks312 you're cool with 2d trees in 2023?
[3:54:26] jypsynv: sounds like a sales job contract
[3:54:30] WytChapp: @piiles ?
[3:54:31] Mostdangspy: So its just a minimum amount guaranteed. Still seems like a good deal so you know you will make at least a certain amount
[3:54:34] Teknofear64: entertaining
[3:54:36] CeruleanStar: so anywaay i know i've been babbling - i'm hoping metzen brings back an actual over-arching story-line that includes the main characters stories coming to close
[3:54:40] mavericks312: @piiles there doing a graphical revamp to that stuff with 11.0 with no new engine
[3:54:49] jypsynv: bet on your comission or take steady money
[3:54:49] Moobot:  Help Towelliee reach the 1,000,000 followers goal. Click that heart button and join the Hammer Squad community!
[3:54:57] Wulfgrym: who sells thick skin ? KEKW
[3:55:29] Starlight_Veil: Also it helps you want to stream just to stream. Never stream because you want money or a job. I mean you could it eventually but you should stream because you like streaming
[3:55:42] biirrd: @Towelliee if you make more then the contract. does twitch keep that then?
[3:55:47] Starlight_Veil: get it eventually**
[3:55:50] Taylormade2711: does anyone know if I have a faction change charge available will Blizz change it to a race change?
[3:55:54] N3llee: you are nuts if you think Metzen is working on Retail story
[3:55:57] Molvonos: I actually enjoy the fact that we're getting a story that's extending into another expansion.
[3:56:03] Captain_Aegis: i just want warcraft rumble to launch lol
[3:56:07] Molvonos: Having a baddie die at the end of every expansion feels like  abatman movie.
[3:56:20] piiles: @mavericks312 oh ok sweet. It's just depressing to visit some of those foresty kalimdor zones and going back two decades in graphics
[3:56:22] bypized: I want THE SWORD OUT @towelliee
[3:56:25] SamuraiWillZ916: i want more dynamic bad and good guys and not, this is bad this is good
[3:56:25] dracullus: well wow has more problem in how story is told than what it is
[3:56:28] cordawg: Retail should just go away and focus on the classic world.
[3:56:30] bypized: Thrall is back
[3:56:30] Captain_Aegis: i know its silly, but i love the collection aspect for games like that
[3:56:34] AlphasaurusRexx: hot take, yall are hard copium on Metzen
[3:56:36] Thoreya: i cant wait to see all the reactions on twitch friday lol
[3:56:37] Molvonos: @cordawg Yea, shut up with that hot take, lol
[3:56:39] mavericks312: I like continuing stories from xpac to xpac
[3:56:43] ambiotic: i just hope whomever is writing takes a step back and simplifies the story lol, the dragon story was so all over the map
[3:56:46] AlphasaurusRexx: @cordawg yeah...no
[3:56:47] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[3:56:52] raldrik: I have disney lines to wait in on Saturday. Looking forward to rumble to get me through it
[3:56:58] Molvonos: Classic is to Retail as PvP is to PvE - Side Story.
[3:57:01] Thoreya: @cordawg classic era was dead before HC dog lol
[3:57:05] ambiotic: what is your biggest pull lately?
[3:57:05] Thoreya: idk about that
[3:57:09] DRS8Sonic: cause you can
[3:57:11] CeruleanStar: it just feels like vanilla>tbc>wotlk>cata>legion was the story - and mop, wod, bfa, sl, df, 11.0 are all just random filler stories written just for content
[3:57:14] Starlight_Veil: yeah people do multi-streams. I see people stream on both twitch and youtube with chat intergration built in
[3:57:17] JoshuaTree6969: reach as many as you can for an audience
[3:57:25] Theduskflyer: TikTok rips are huge viewers
[3:57:27] amaceika: I haven't tried watching on TikTok.
[3:57:32] ambiotic: Oh shit nice
[3:57:33] prophitmoffett: what flovor u vaping on
[3:57:34] mavericks312: Classic needs retail to survive, with no retail there would be no classic

[4:08:33] mavericks312: Les with the subtle push lol

[4:13:23] WytChapp: @GroovyBryan they already have a heroic version out
[4:13:43] DunzoCD: i kinda hope Blizz is shooting for that 18 month expansion angle, with the pace of content weve gotten this expansion I think its good for the game rather than having a throw away season
[4:14:01] dpbdagger: isnt 3 raids and pushing an expansion every 18 months more work actually? and more variety?
