[0:47:53] thebakeriscomingforu: Overall I like Shadowlands better, I find gearing a bit off in pve. Visions also had more going for it when compared to Torghast.
[0:47:55] elitepower97: The gearing in shadowlands put me off trying to even do mythic + so i just chill in pvp bgs
[0:48:19] TheUnknowing: sanguine is always going to be the worst lol
[0:48:25] ManneehFresh: TOP is my least favorite
[0:48:25] thebakeriscomingforu: Torghast looks cooler to me, but besides soul ash there isn't a point

[0:48:44] big__truss: the 2nd boss is a bitch

[0:48:46] lumaday: It’s crazy. None of the affixes work here.
[0:48:46] toobaked1987: Islands were better than the maw. Vision were better than Torghast by and far. imo
[0:49:21] deckardblade: apparently the adds in halls before last boss do
[0:49:23] zaraine1: yeah they do just did it
[0:49:59] ExtreemeCheese: explosives have no health though. they die from one auto attack
[0:50:13] deckardblade: ya
[0:50:19] zaraine1: tyrannical last boss pf ... always a nightmare
[0:50:23] swordwindgaming: Yeah but if your tank accidentally pulls two tanks, you're done.
[0:50:29] swordwindgaming: *two packs
[0:50:32] elitepower97: Torghast is cool but we need more rewards from it

[1:26:05] ColdChillXI: tcpWow
[1:26:06] ManneehFresh: hmmm
[1:26:07] Secondbreakfasttt: towPog
[1:26:08] Darthyrevan: He knows! :O

[1:26:16] Sollice: Oh I am not writing them off. I pray that it gets gud again
[1:26:17] cptrogers123: what do you think about weekly affixes @Towelliee
[1:26:18] SlayerLightStorm: @MrGattz Idk how many hours I had in D2. Glad I quit playing.
[1:26:18] im_n0t_jezus: payoS
[1:26:22] Sollice: I LOVED the concept of that game
[1:26:26] ColdChillXI: Dont give me hope
[1:26:38] Rulem: I played anthem for like 150 hours still; really enjoyed it
[1:26:44] Catspaw66: EA needs a new pipline since they just lost the star wars rights
[1:26:50] ambiotic: the combat of anthem was the best
[1:26:57] Sollice: EA didn't lose Star Wars rights
[1:27:01] Sollice: They are still making games
[1:27:10] SlayerLightStorm: 42 hours. Not playing it again.
[1:27:11] Sollice: I think Lucas is just using multiple game devs now for games
[1:27:12] cptrogers123: what do you think about weekly affixes @Towelliee
[1:27:26] Ashandai: firelands tho
[1:27:28] ambiotic: firelands raid
[1:27:29] Ashandai: thats hype
[1:27:29] xx_rummey_xx: Glad I dropped in! But bed time for moi here in the UK! Night all, thanks for stream Towelie!
[1:27:30] Darthyrevan: @Sollice Yeah they just lost the exclusivity
[1:28:06] Sollice: @Darthyrevan True, but I think thats for the best. Many devs making Star Wars games hopefully will push all devs making Star Wars games to push out grewaat games
[1:28:06] ManneehFresh: when is it?
[1:28:12] Mecabeast: is this wagnaros
[1:28:34] DerpingDumbo: i thought the back blades were super high renown
[1:28:42] Epiclurker27893: Exclusive contract ends in 2023 I think so about now would be the right time to start developing new games.
[1:28:44] Darthyrevan: @Sollice oh for sure! its about time too, havent been too impressed the past few years and almost everything star wars impresses me :P
[1:28:49] TechieTaco: Do you use a tank or RDA on your vape?
[1:29:01] Sadisticmedic: I like Pet event
[1:29:23] Einzbern: it gave 30% haste for like 12 sec
[1:29:23] d1stract10n: pet that makes you stronger
[1:29:25] sav37: gives haste im pretty sure
[1:29:32] Sollice: I would be total hyped for a new star wars MMO
[1:29:35] solocube: true
[1:29:38] solocube: pet sucks
[1:29:42] Ryondious: PogChamp
[1:30:06] Rulem: I cant wait to see what Riot can do with an MMO
[1:30:12] Sollice: Nah there wont be for a while, just would like one. That concept of what Star Wars 1313? The Star Wars underworld one looked good
[1:30:22] Sollice: Let's get in to some of the dark side and seedy shit in Star Wars.
[1:30:29] MrGattz: no its gonna be another zelda breath of the wilds clone but in the starwars universe 100%
[1:30:41] ambiotic: i still like the star wars mmo like once a year, go in and level a new toon. just needs a combat overhaul
[1:30:43] sav37: its up
[1:30:49] Darthyrevan: RIP Star Wars 1313
[1:30:52] TheUnknowing: That would be dope though @MrGattz BOTW was amazing
[1:30:57] Catspaw66: the trouble with a new star wars mmo... I wouldn't have time for it since it would take away wow time -)
[1:31:04] sav37: it looks like a yelling mouth aand laasts like 12sec or something
[1:31:10] SlayerLightStorm: towDerp
[1:31:14] DanielTheMedic: that would be cool
[1:31:22] Sollice: I would go back and try it out if it got a rework
[1:31:23] ColdChillXI: wouldnt be surprised, with the mando show hype
[1:31:31] TheUnknowing: SWTOR should do what WoW did, level squish and just rehaul of some things
[1:31:32] Sollice: SWTOR online was pretty good
[1:31:32] MrGattz: @TheUnknowing oh hell yeah im not complaining, i would buy the hell out of a starwars BOTW game.
[1:31:37] sharie: SWTOR A Galaxy Reborn
[1:31:40] TheUnknowing: I loved swtor when it launched
[1:31:48] mazzu7000: that would make me play it again

[1:32:54] Warcraftthor: I missed that is SWTOR getting an upgrade?
[1:33:08] TheUnknowing: if they like rework swtor and make it amazing, talking about awesome raids, dungeons and etc consistently being released, im in
[1:33:11] DrRockso85: Buttons doesnt deserve to be in there man, he aint done nothin
[1:33:14] Sollice: Anyone playing Fury Warrior? WHat do we think of the recent buffs? Still more to go? Are you feeling more competitive?
[1:33:25] zuluhawk: Bad engine did not help swtor at all
[1:33:26] Warcraftthor: OMG yesssssss!!!!!!!!!
[1:33:36] Catspaw66: wow has been more well managed . while swtor feels like it's been mis managed from the get go .

[1:36:06] Sollice: LoL does have apretty rich lore though
[1:36:12] RedDeadFredd: vr could change it
[1:36:16] Warcraftthor: It would be good if they could do something becuase LoL has some really good lore behind it
[1:36:27] TheFabilolz: @Sollice Lore doesn't make a game itself
[1:36:31] azzurrin: But using MoP class design

[1:37:09] azzurrin: VR has failed twice
[1:37:16] Mecabeast: hey destiny did raids first person

[1:55:53] ambiotic: tc is random
[1:55:54] ebone45: not after u clear 1st floor I think
[1:55:54] understyle88: nope
[1:55:58] CrossThread: not in twisting corridor
[1:56:03] Masqerader: tc is random
[1:56:04] CrossThread: and not if you choose a different level
[1:56:07] Affiiance: Not in Twisting Corridors
[1:56:15] ebone45: oh didnt know that
[1:56:38] riftplaya4ever: jwy toweliee hows it going brotha
[1:56:48] maccaruso: Hate TC. Got to Floor 17. Never got a health modifier perk. One shot by mobs. 1.5 hours wasted.
[1:57:10] Masqerader: or he will chese it into mobs and aggro the shit out of them all
[1:57:16] Masqerader: that's always fun too
[1:57:20] Masqerader: *chase
[1:57:23] CrossThread: i see you have that spires trinket.. i want that thing so bad
[1:57:46] Etines4: The perk where it explodes for max health when it hits critical health and the skill it loses 2% hp in combat are op
[1:57:58] riftplaya4ever: WHAT LEVEL ARE YOU ON NOW?
[1:58:09] riftplaya4ever: opps sorry 4 caps
[1:58:35] Mallaes: It's Wormy! :D
[1:58:37] pera_red: bite hurts
[1:58:39] Hugest: @thalomus Hmm alright.. Only thing I'm concerned of is my mouse lol. I used to have a Naga with all the buttons on the side, but since getting rid of that I've found this game almost impossible to play without all the buttons
[1:58:58] Masqerader: tanks should get twilight devastation as a power in Torghast, just my toughts
[1:59:03] Mallaes: 👍
[1:59:38] Havenmess: What flavor of Foreloco is your favorite?
[1:59:39] thalomus: @Hugest I agree haha I use a corsair scimitar
[2:00:04] Mecabeast: @towelliee heroic dungeons have rune bags for tanks atm
[2:00:21] Frank4LuLz: 4loco is ghetto
[2:00:24] bitstep: what kinda vape you g ot?
[2:00:49] Affiiance: All 3 Monk specs are OP for it
[2:01:25] bitstep: how do you acquire more companions for the command table??
[2:01:48] Kinghorn: torghast and renown bitstep
[2:01:50] ebone45: @bitstep TG and renown
[2:01:52] pilhass10: @bitstep thorgast and getting all the renowns

[2:02:15] daniel85mg: i think they tweaked kyrian..... from day to night soulash missions became winnable
[2:02:22] Kinghorn: plaguefall is easy with the side skip after the first boss
[2:02:35] Kinghorn: dont need to worry about % just skip everything
[2:03:11] ebone45: it's so damn satisfying after clearing layer 8 of TC then mounting up in The Maw
[2:03:20] Kinghorn: as long as they dont nerf necro they can do whatever they want
[2:03:31] Tru1485: they nerfed the soulash mission a few weeks ago
[2:03:49] Crowzcut: some people saying they nerfing corridors for the maw mount lol
[2:03:52] TheUnknowing: All i want is prot pally buff, pls and ty blizzard
[2:04:52] azzurrin: Torgast feels like a damn choir.
[2:05:08] Supers18: it was just a grind
[2:05:08] Sadisticmedic: @TheUnknowing for Raiding yes
[2:05:11] porkchoptv: torghast could have been super cool, but it turned out to be a really underwhelming, unrewarding activity imo
[2:05:17] Supers18: not comparable to MT at all
[2:05:20] Supers18: when it was current
[2:05:47] TheUnknowing: @Sadisticmedic for pve content yes, defensive buffs are needed. PVP they probably need a nerf lol
[2:06:06] xavier2119: @porkchoptv unrewarding yes, i woudln't say its underwhelming. It does what its meant to do. nothing more, nothing less
[2:06:11] Crowzcut: make a maw mount shop mounts it will be
[2:06:15] Mecabeast: the thing is they need to make it winnable at layer 8 even without powers but it needs to be difficult. right now if you don't have powers that synergize then you fail the run.
[2:06:33] Affiiance: One day they will learn all they have to do is shower us with cosmetics
[2:06:38] Xailen: Torghast is ok, just not very rewarding.
[2:06:46] porkchoptv: @xavier2119 thats my point, it could have been such a corner stone activity to the start of the xpack and its just not. Its a chore at this point that we have to do LUL
[2:06:52] yeti82: did all 36 in Mage tower, when you learned the fights, it was easy :)
[2:07:08] mrniceguy817: The blood dk at launch of mage tower was rough I wiped a lot
[2:07:10] Janribet: what keyboard and mouse do you use
[2:07:10] Teidran: @Towelliee are prot pally still like a glass canon?

[2:07:41] SlayerLightStorm: I say, they need to learn how to play their class.
[2:07:42] thebakeriscomingforu: could be drunk trolling
[2:07:45] ebone45: I was on layer 8 floor 16 for TC and my wife wanted me to take her out for bit, told her no I was a little busy atm, totally worth sleeping on the couch for a few days after getting that mount LUL
[2:07:48] Kinghorn: they need to add the island mounts to the twisted corridor somehow, chance to drop after a run
[2:08:01] TheUnknowing: My paladin at 202 ish gets wreck in raids @Sadisticmedic lol
[2:08:33] Tyvokkaa: i would not want them, i agree
[2:08:56] Kinghorn: it would be lazy but it would be something. something is better than the nothing you get for completing odd floors
[2:09:09] SlayerLightStorm: Other than that, ain't saying shit.
[2:09:12] Tyvokkaa: nah, the people that already have the island mounts would be mad
[2:09:12] givmeafrekinname: can't you just summon the mage with the warlock?
[2:09:22] grapyz: Imagine a mount where all you get is wings

[2:57:22] MurderofPhoenixes: wut
[2:57:33] CritcobainTV: @Affiiance not really, it only increases dmg / healing by 40% effectiveness, which means if you're at like 20% vers you get what, like 8%? so if the trinket gives 12-13% it's better for burst
[2:57:35] shimwood: Boomies 😍
[2:57:39] DarkSlayer978: watch they kill first boss and the druids leave
[2:57:45] TheBeastofCaerBannog: you've died and gone to Druidia
[2:58:11] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee in arena it puts me from 20.70 to 31.12% vers
[2:58:16] CritcobainTV: so yeah, it works in arena
[2:59:04] hitnat4sho: hitnat4sho subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! yo
[2:59:26] CritcobainTV: its better just for burst, but the double pvp trinkets will probably give you more vers overall if you're at 20% base vers cause of the set @Towelliee

[3:01:13] CritcobainTV: versatility* typing is hard
[3:01:50] CritcobainTV: No no it's 40 of 21%
[3:02:10] faulen: And it has nothing to do with DR just dmg and healing

[3:07:00] devaston: yeah they just say "point to where i sign" most of the time people are tired of the process by the time the notary shows up.
[3:07:03] SportsCardHobby: hell yea running prot pally this xpac
[3:07:20] CritcobainTV: I doubt it, holy is better lol
[3:07:29] CritcobainTV: Prot is a lot easier to counter
[3:08:01] Koruth: As an Arms warrior I'd rather have a Protection Paladin in 2v2 and Holy Paladin in 3v3
[3:08:31] CritcobainTV: yeah, but you can stun / cc their guardian of ancient queens, they don't have any flat damage reduction like holy pally. Prot is def nice in 2's, but i think it's a lot easier to kill in 3s
