[0:43:51] abracka_: was pretty funny we got the wow token in wotlk before a dungeon finder
[0:43:55] chefdejour82: Ozruk in Stonecore is the fun one to watch
[0:43:59] Niksen_99: Do you think the wow token is good on classic
[0:44:09] Keyastaron_: see super busted
[0:44:23] Molvonos: I think it was kind of expected, tbh.
[0:44:28] Keyastaron_: melting
[0:44:31] Scarhearth: the full eating duration
[0:44:41] Scarhearth: you need a healer spam healing you to live
[0:44:49] Molvonos: The original reason the token was created was to counter gold sellers, GDKP runs only made it worse, lol.
[0:44:52] dien2474: undertuned
[0:45:15] Keyastaron_: #NOCHANGES
[0:45:17] Keyastaron_: Kappa
[0:45:25] coldarmorTBG: what level did you make it to on HC on your pally?
[0:45:26] Epicsapphire1988: im mad abouit that - i would play wrath if they had the dungeon
[0:45:33] TheUnknowing: id play wrath if they had the dungeon finder lol
[0:45:42] Rilix: anyone who is mad at the token in wrath just must not play wrath. 95% of the people playing wrath just buy gold illegally. and those that dont get their gold from those that do in GDKP's
[0:45:45] resarane: also lets not forget the fact that they're the same people that are already buying gold just not from blizz xD
[0:45:46] Flebboo: togc KEKW
[0:45:50] adxx: yeah,  agreed. no one cares at this point for wrath and the wow token. Classic Wrath is more like retail than Classic vanilla anyways
[0:45:50] Snabido: Let the community have their monhtly outcry over something blizz related CoolCat
[0:45:56] Molvonos: I mean, I didn't know many people who were hyped over that raid tier when it was originally released either.
[0:45:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  dude diablo 4 is 10 times hype then the wotlk update
[0:46:03] Keyastaron_: i got all the dungeons done in wrath from guild lst month LUL
[0:46:14] Niksen_99: People been buying gold in classic since MC release in 2019 LUL
[0:46:18] abracka_: @TheUnknowing main thing that keeps making me quit playing is the absence of it
[0:46:19] HaloS23: @Towelliee think Blizz will do their own "Hardcore" server? havent been keeping up on it.
[0:46:38] temp3st98: yeah people pay from thid party sites to get gold so why care now LuL

[0:47:29] yados: I'm really glad they did a 50% exp boost
[0:47:31] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  it kinda died when we were making gold in the garrisions and the wow token in WoD
[0:47:38] yados: in wrath the xp boost is really nice 50% is a lot
[0:47:42] HaloS23: Oh really! guess i need to get out from under my rock more....
[0:47:54] blntmasta420: CrayonTime
[0:48:00] the_bad_goat: Botting has gotten expensive now. Roughly 50/month just for program and key
[0:48:06] Flebboo: i haven't seen a bot in retail since early SL but i could also not have been checking around enough
[0:48:07] Molvonos: Once Blizz made it so that multiple people could tap nodes, it also kind of diminished bot influence.
[0:48:09] Keyastaron_: 10K gold is alot tho LUL
[0:48:13] Keyastaron_: in wrath that is
[0:48:25] abracka_: it's down to like 7.5k now
[0:48:26] temp3st98: eu is like 17k
[0:48:29] just_kirk_: down to 7k this morning
[0:48:33] Knocx: i mean 20 bucks is 20 bucks
[0:48:34] Snabido: Look, future patch boss 😏
[0:48:38] Flebboo: yh good point
[0:48:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: i just wish i could cash in my classic gold for blizzard balance for diablo 4 stuff since im done with classic
[0:48:42] blntmasta420: So I'm thinking about buying the $100 edition of diablo 4 valarrLURK
[0:48:49] Rilix: 10k gold is usually a lot, but in wrath classic people are buying normal items in GDKP's for 50k+
[0:48:55] DunzoCD: nobody wants to run the risk to get their account suspended for buying gold either on retail
[0:48:56] jaina8675309: its down to7996 now
[0:48:57] Rilix: so its basically nothing
[0:49:08] PvtHudson093: Anything good in vault?
[0:49:09] jaina8675309: 7696
[0:49:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bots and gold farmers are a plague in games, but for sure there are fewer of them in WoW with the tokens
[0:49:29] Keyastaron_: holy shit really
[0:49:29] im_capy: buying gametime with gold
[0:49:32] Flebboo: Its went up to 17k last night on EU and now its down to 14k
[0:49:41] Rilix: the more people are selling them on the AH the lower the price goes

[0:50:17] Mecabeast: Went from 0 tier to 4pc yesterday between vault m+ tier token winning a boss drop and getting the sark omni was a good night

[1:06:53] Foretoldlegends: I think the problem is that the rise of GDKP probably killed a huge chunk of Wrath Classic's hype. The hard reserving of gear and the loot rule divides eventually pit the Classic community against each other.
[1:06:55] Sharkeys: KEKW WoD classic gonna relive the selfie patch all over again

[2:07:05] Hitmanblood: Yeah you get what you pay for, if you by a 150$ no name from amazon it will suck. a good 500-1000$ "gaming" chair is pretty great now adays. AND they look sick
[2:07:11] Hitmanblood: hermin miller looks like a office chair
[2:07:11] Poisonblack44: Was trying to find the video of you getting the Sha mount last night and ended up going down the YouTube rabbit hole with a bunch of old Towelliee videos. Top 25 watched clips were hilarious 😂

[2:18:30] SimplyRed: the real question is should you NOT go on reddit and see what they are talking about
[2:18:52] raldrik: I would stay away from Classic reddit on stream. It is now just advertisements for private servers. They lifted the rules that dont allow that.
[2:19:17] Hitmanblood: Ban the gold buyers, they can see who gets 5000 gold randomly in the mail from a lvl 1. If they can't get the bots punish people, make them afraid to risk their account.

[2:19:38] Epiclurker27893: ban one bot type and they make a better bot, rinse and repeat
[2:20:00] chefdejour82: they try and get to the main source
[2:20:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: The WoW token cuts down the gold sellers at the knees
[2:20:23] rockysimracing: cops pickup the most obvious drug dealers and same goes for botters, being obvious..might get banned but yeah its down to waves
[2:20:42] SimplyRed: I dunno man, i can't see how people on private servers are able to do a better job than blizzard handling that situation. People working for free to GM live on the spot.
[2:20:43] Samurai3434: Same. Can't say I've seen a multiboxxer in more than a year
[2:20:48] Kriven: i really hate the whole free to play system. I get why its done but I hate it none the less
[2:20:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: New World still has problems with gold farmers and bots
[2:20:55] KnsWoW: people cry to cry
[2:21:02] diivil92: the bots hella ruined teh economy
[2:21:06] Hitmanblood: I think the biggest issue was that blizzard gave gold buyers a slap on the wrist. 99% of people never get caught buying it. When they do they get a two week ban and half the time they keep the gold.
[2:21:08] diivil92: in lost ark
[2:21:11] steeldeal615: warth players are just going to raid log lol
[2:21:24] daniel85mg: GDKP endgame
[2:21:31] hammack52: i think the biggest complaint i can think of that they might have is that you can log on to your retail account use the easierly accuierd gold to buy a tocken convert it to money and buy a classic token to get classic gold

[2:23:17] captain_khyzan: The community is 100% to blame for GDKP, you reap what you sow

[2:25:10] CeruleanStar: i think the wow history is exactly the kind of timeline that would work well with time or progression locked servers -- starts with classic, and patches/raids unlock under either a timer (1mo?2mo?) or when enough guilds kill the current raid boss(es)
[2:25:12] PoppaShot: when i did BC classic it wasnt the same man @Towelliee i did enjoy vanilla classic cause i never got to experience that.  but im still a retail person.. i might give hardcore servers a go though
[2:25:19] CeruleanStar: and would work all the way up to retail honestly
[2:25:21] Hitmanblood: Brah the classic community was going to do everything in their power to degen that shit. Its a old game, everything is easier and the strats and optimization was there

[2:27:25] NotEnoughMana: maaaaan firelands is not happening duuuude :(
[2:27:29] daniel85mg: i think we need HC servers, and something new like Classic+ ore something
[2:27:30] vic_ave: no one wants to grind 80 levels just questing
[2:27:32] Sherm0: i must say tho HC is something nice they should consider for damn sure and i hope they do it right

[2:32:36] Outerlaw: person would have a shadow ban for that IMO
[2:32:40] Cheezburglar804: they could make major city deaths not count somehow
[2:32:42] Hitmanblood: Hardcore launch gonna be sick.
[2:32:43] Sayryn: Terrormist is kited into Stormwind regularly.
[2:32:44] Sherm0: yes for sure
[2:32:44] Alienfromger: its clever use of game mechanixs no griefing^^
[2:32:47] Hitmanblood: some fun for a month or so
[2:32:49] im_capy: especially as a streamer
[2:32:56] Mecabeast: There was the dude in classic who kited a dragon to stormwind every day for over a year
[2:33:02] Sherm0: imagine u die on a high lvl and you get griefed and its just done... thats just stupid

[2:33:05] Nejba: DC deaths are about the only thing that I would mind tbh
[2:33:14] Hebrewish012: lol imagine someone spreading a disease that kills everyone in ironforge / stormwind
[2:33:15] Hitmanblood: It will most likely be on a pve server were you can't flag for PVP for sure, as one change
[2:33:39] Cheezburglar804: one huge think i realized i missed was the sparkles on ground quest items like that! lol
[2:33:43] im_capy: The HC community will need to make events to promote so a year from now, people want to come back after the burn out
[2:33:46] CrunkyBrewster: I remember seeing a clip on reddit some someone who kited a dragon into the Deadmines to kill people in a Line Queue LUL
[2:33:48] killmasa: inb4 appeal as microtx Kappa
[2:33:49] Cheezburglar804: and yeah tauren struggle with bags at the start
[2:34:33] im_capy: ontop of addons that can cause deeper investigations
[2:34:42] Masqerader: running into a town
[2:34:46] Maydie6066: I feel like i'd get hate, but for a blizzard HC classic, i'd really want small things like enemy health numbers and 40yrd target bars
[2:34:53] Hitmanblood: IMO appeals as a payed service would be SICK
[2:34:57] mikenet57: SOL
[2:35:09] HunchoLeo_: bunch of people died to a server dc yesterday
[2:35:11] Vahs_Redclaw: naw

[2:35:22] Sherm0: Griefers even had a own discord and shit and rank ups per grief.... imagine HOW DEAD the game would be if you could grief and blizzard couldnt handle it literally UNPLAYABLE

[2:35:45] akia03: how can you proof it was a dc and not just a forcefll shutoff game
[2:35:48] Dixa1: look at POE. there is no appeal. those players even have quick disconnect macros to keep from dying
[2:35:49] dustyzoose: do u have to pay for the HC mod ?
[2:35:52] ottavianni: in d3 i think that dc deaths are still deaths no  reverse
[2:35:54] Maydie6066: @Towelliee thoughts on a HC where its open tag for people? so you don't have lines of people waiting for 1 mob respawn?
[2:36:03] freetherocktv: @Towelliee what about hiring the hardcore dev team addon to do the blizzard official? Like the team to monitor stuff

[2:37:07] Skobble: @im_capy always
[2:37:09] Hebrewish012: what's even a discord griefer ?
[2:37:16] Dixa1: however those that use an exploit or something to get somenoe killed on hardcore need to be dealt with when reported, especially if that is all they are doing the entire time they are logged into the game
[2:37:17] Sollice: His PC lit on fire? God damn lol

[2:38:06] SimplyRed: you mean have some level of accountability?
[2:38:07] Samurai3434: I play retail, but enjoy HC. Not sure I understand why the AH isn'a available though tbh
[2:38:11] Hebrewish012: it's a lot of work for blizzard to manage it, I don't think they care unless it brings them money
[2:38:17] Meliea_EU: hc addon on curseforge
[2:38:30] Sollice: @Hebrewish012 Because you could have people playing non hardcore giving you cheaper items on AH kind of thing
[2:38:32] Hitmanblood: @cyrosis50, You download the battle.net launcher, you download wow classic, you pay 15$ a month sub. You download the wow hardcore addon.
[2:38:36] Sollice: You can't control the people not using the mod
[2:38:38] Dixa1: it's unlikely the hardcore server will disallow the ah or the mailbox and what not.
