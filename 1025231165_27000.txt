[8:12:22] Zukakok: @VasiTwitch Ligma spread as a joke in May 2018. It’s based on other jokes that feature an unusual word that sets a person up for a silly, often vulgar punchline, e.g., updog or deez nuts. In the case of ligma, when someone uses ligma, the goal is to get another person to ask “What’s ligma?” The response is something along the lines of “ligma balls,” with ligma meant to sound like “lick my.”

[8:12:52] biggestkekk: In the metaphysics of identity, the ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The concept is one of the oldest in Western philosophy, having been discussed by the likes of Heraclitus and Plato by c. 500–400 BC.
