[0:15:45] SwiisH_Tv: yeah locks run the world now
[0:15:46] squarepusher_: no buffs to ret defensives, and the plate nerf just makes ret even more of a glass cannon.
[0:15:46] ajdowers: Survival Hunter got a small dmg buff.  And hunters rip through casters. Maybe a counter to the meta ? THUG could maybe be good now ? Less melee cleaves ?
[0:15:50] phanabananana: The plate nerf will kill ret they will die also faster

[3:43:17] aTactical: @Pwnyo808 that spec makes my brain hurt
[3:44:06] Pwnyo808: @aTactical i need help on it, i know i'm doing something wrong, cuz i pretty much am always either 1/2 on damage
[3:44:24] Rhaspers: can someone link me the upcoming patch notes =)
[3:44:25] Pwnyo808: but it's all good, just gotta go next.  there's also a lot of bad play in those lobbies i'm not good enough to overcome as that spec
