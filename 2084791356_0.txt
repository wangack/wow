[0:31:46] OnifixTV: 1k coins on a mage group is crap xD
[0:31:48] ketchgg: 500 is average for me
[0:31:49] LilTaisu: im a melee hunter and 500 is normal
[0:31:49] NotOp: Difference between a scrappy group and a cooridnated group is massive
[0:31:51] coalminer69: i got more solo before
[0:31:52] ShingaTV: nah good group is 800-1,6k

[0:32:13] fynns__: @Farkedarp thats rough cause locks and paladins are what always get me back into wow
[0:32:14] chickodie: 500 is average for me
[0:32:15] Lewbra: for sure people's  view is skewed
[0:32:18] luoseno: I would say 500 is a good group so probably 300 average
[0:32:19] nicktamere666: you heard that guys, 5 is above average
[0:32:20] simplegeoffy: I'm an average player that runs solo alot, and i do about 75-100 per event

[0:32:40] wubblers: how do you play cata beta??
[0:32:42] chrislu18: 300 - 400 is normal for most groups who don't know how to group up. 500-800 is normal for groups who group and play smart. no cheesing
[0:32:44] tuben96: move raid frames <3

[0:33:11] Himaru7: 24 gold coins if its not more easy

[0:33:17] ShingaTV: yeppers :D
[0:33:18] clault: Bengal Tiger is going to be a raid drop

[0:35:08] ketchgg: @Xaryu what bomb should I be using for pvp?

[0:36:14] xLowkey9: blizzard would not give a way to farm an endgame rep at lvl 40
[0:36:17] Farkedarp: @fynns__ Viable pvp for locks atm is literally go full tank/self healing and just try to outlive people or go full destro and hope you get off hard casts. Pure affy lock atm is extremely weak lol

[0:36:56] madokar56: That mount IS a weapon guys
[0:36:57] bushthebug: @Xaryu that would make sense as a way to bring players back to STV around 60 when they can get rep easier via ZG

[1:33:08] jandoodle2: hmm having a heal seems tough ngl
[1:33:25] CFwontStopMe: @critcobain hell yea when i ran hunter? good to see you!
[1:33:29] KourneStream: If he gets off a healing touch, that’s basically a block for him
[1:33:39] Toopaid2freestyl: ally druids are soft as hell out hre camping lvl 20s in hilsbrad....never a fair fight with these girls
[1:33:44] axridario: @lanewillingham mana shield is only physical dmg in classic as well in sod no?

[1:34:18] MeisterZuk: Heal and kicks... you cant do anything as boomi
[1:34:19] Skwidlegs: ah shoot i gotta play chrono
[1:34:19] critcobain: yeah you were on hunter back then. I mained rogue, I'm not even 100% sure what my name was back then. Probably Critcobain or Mortedio since that was about 8 years ago
[1:34:21] Bishox: CHRONO is so strong man
[1:34:22] SpaceCowboy0811: average mage loses to boomy
[1:34:22] Dank1116: if Druid opens in feral maybe he wins
[1:34:23] SatanicAngelBlazed: CS and heal ya
[1:34:23] Moonfirebeam: the buffs and ur a god

[1:34:39] Moonfirebeam: lemme go more dam
[1:34:39] espi: @00Absurd he can't be in mkform
[1:34:39] nopassi0n: Ive been saying I think mage is favoured
[1:34:40] Beakz______: its not even close, mage has so many tools, boomys just have damage that they have to cast
[1:34:42] charmacmoney: no?
[1:34:43] Moonfirebeam: 1 more gear swap
[1:34:44] Katniss_Evermeme: Mages having counterspell + self healing makes the matchup hard for the moonkin
[1:34:44] thebigdongerhere: I mean if he doesnt use invis sure u are fav
[1:34:45] Bishox: mage wasnt designed with that heal in mind , insane class now

[1:34:49] kevo_k: @Moonfirebeam  you tired though 14 hour stream lmaooo
[1:34:50] Mahca_: @00absurd really don’t need it against mage
[1:34:57] Lifeles85: monkaW phase 2
[1:34:58] jandoodle2: if both sides had no heal i think mage would win
[1:34:59] 00Absurd: oh makes sense
[1:35:00] DJfatboss: stfu about heal, just give boomy kick and u have other situation
[1:35:00] Xzanelol: the heal mana buff actually did so much
[1:35:02] iPlayCuzFun: whats the score rn tho?

[1:35:11] blazzedzz: Come onnnnn lucky SF crit
[1:35:11] Messn3r: cant one shot people with starsurge anymore
[1:35:16] Catalystic_Sudo: Ayup chat how’s it going!
[1:35:16] CFwontStopMe: mage seems favored. both amazing players but mage seems favored

[2:13:38] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu I think we should send this duel of you+moonfirebeam to blizzard to make them nerf/buff all to a point where we got duels like this consistently https://clips.twitch.tv/BadCooperativeSardineShadyLulu-9vGGkbQPevqMA9nM
[2:13:38] thehorrorblygreatshow: You literally flick a "switch" to use your Prime on mobile.
[2:13:44] Elijahss: @Atruis_ they changed it
[2:13:46] julienb95: I'm addicted to diet soda 😩
[2:13:47] SilentWisco: Ive never had a trouble pugging either raid bc of io or logs and always cleared
[2:13:47] adam_brisbane: Blizzard can close the site down if they did not want it so they must like it
[2:13:48] spleen_eater: SOD wants you to be in a guild, which is fine
[2:13:49] MONNlBLAST: @Udenwo ''not worth'' anything that increases dmg is considered worth
[2:13:52] disar27: @thehorrorblygreatshow how do you subscribe on prime with mobile?
[2:13:55] Z1Vrs: @xaryu well I was wondering which one would be better on mage for raid: the enchanted sigil or mildly irridated rejuvenation potion
[2:13:56] HonestPhilosophy: How long until primes are gone?
[2:13:56] mussyduss: Thats all the retail community does is complain
[2:13:57] nexu__: nexu__ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! hi mister xaryu
[2:13:59] roflwithurgf3: Whats ur /played time?

[2:14:16] patriciobueno: jokrdWink jokrdWink
[2:14:23] Blkmrkt1: blizz can close API
[2:14:25] RoaminIrl: just watch xaryu run it enough times then start your own group.
[2:14:25] neomonstr: It'd be so good
[2:14:27] noochlol: game is gg

[2:14:30] CatformTV: no one would be upset
[2:14:31] Plokoon100: and?
[2:14:34] Ervill1: id start playing again maybe
[2:14:34] JamesIRL: parsing is the only thing to work towards. the raid is too easy to care about just clearing
[2:14:35] AkillianSNJ: imagine playing games for fun
[2:14:37] Jahesch: i would be upset
[2:14:37] ketchgg: xaryu. roll twice. second roll higher = 5 subs.

[2:14:48] LilTaisu: lol
[2:14:50] CatformTV: I knew you would read it
[2:14:51] adam_brisbane: I think 80% of players would not be upset
[2:14:52] MikeyMacaroni: why don’t the just open 1-2 servers with no add ons
[2:14:53] krulfar: raiderio is already integrated in retail with the m+ rating system
[2:14:54] noone_b: im not upset
[2:14:55] nevster58: that guy is trash at the game
[2:14:55] EMPERIC: so many people would be angry for sure
[2:14:56] JamesIRL: I would be upset if logs got removed
[2:14:58] neomonstr: They need to make BIG changes if they want retail to live on
[2:15:00] jimg3: they would get over it tho in time. no one ever really quits wow
[2:15:02] PaxedUP: If they remove what?

[2:15:12] Blkmrkt1: ppl who dont even farm prebis complain
[2:15:13] Spl1ker: didnt blizzard add their own "raiderio" into the game anyway? but its kinda scuffed
[2:15:13] Omahasteaks: my toes are frozen.
[2:15:14] Hirshberg: mitch jones OMEGALUL
[2:15:16] oldsanta100: GOING TO MITCH, POG. LOVE YOU XAR
[2:15:16] 1Tavino: yo
[2:15:16] treyywow: oh shit
[2:15:17] bad19999993: Its nice to have something to work for in these easy raids
[2:15:17] krulfar: i would be upset
[2:15:19] BroodingDoob: what about removing arena rating??
[2:15:19] Cazlin: Ditch Jones OMEGALUL
[2:15:19] billybeer181920: Veteran players, don't want to play with new players. It's like that in every game, Just more in your face in wow
[2:15:20] treyywow: ditch jones?
[2:15:20] EekazPlays: if what ?
[2:15:21] buzja: yo
[2:15:22] adam_brisbane: no way near a majority
[2:15:25] d2jayden: on paper its nice to see how YOU'RE doing compared to other players and helps people improve and it still does that but it breeds so much toxic shit
[2:15:25] Kryptiiq: I would cry
[2:15:26] 1Tavino: type YO for give away!!
[2:15:26] Genghish: Nah WCLogs is good, its like Arena rating, just wasted 3hours because i didnt check the groups logs... S
[2:15:29] NowStreamingFullTimeKappa: ditch jones Kreygasm
[2:15:31] treyywow: the return of the ditch
[2:15:34] killadalegend: am i just new to wow but why isnt there a goblin for horde in sod DansGame
[2:15:34] EekazPlays: oh yeah game would suck
[2:15:39] FeelsGoodManX: remove addons too
[2:15:42] DindonOli: it would be so good fr
[2:15:44] FeelsGoodManX: while you're at it
[2:15:45] Western7: they should get rid of warcraft logs so no one can make fun of me again :)
[2:15:46] bottis96: no casual would notice
[2:15:48] ketchgg: they would lose a huge portion of their player base
[2:15:51] Zielepoot: that would be the best thing ever
[2:15:52] adam_brisbane: your in a pvp zone
[2:15:55] lilplatotv: contested zone
[2:15:55] f4a_tony: @Xaryu have you duel'ed a warlock with soul link yet?
[2:15:56] xian_archive: he didnt even come online lol
[2:15:57] Atruis_: pvp zone duh
[2:16:02] treyywow: world of Warcraft wrath of the ditch king
[2:16:05] lilodot: It would be a huge W but would take a long time for the community to get over it
[2:16:07] treyywow: DarkMode
[2:16:08] Whetherey: if wow was new game do u think dps calc etc should be made available?
[2:16:11] ShingaTV: not a goodie D:
[2:16:16] Z1Vrs: which would be better? the enchanted sigil or the mildly irridated rejuvenation potion ? @xaryu
[2:16:18] LilTaisu: you guys saying it would be the best things ever are prolly grey parsers who cant full clear
[2:16:19] LilTaisu: lets be honest
[2:16:25] roflwithurgf3: I like that you still play SOD i quit after phase 1 lasted too long just got back for 100% exp buff did gnomer in day 1 lol trying to see whats broken now.
[2:16:26] c3relki11er: make fun of that man!
[2:16:28] adam_brisbane: you can remove yourself from warcraft logs and raider io
[2:16:29] freeshnee: tru
[2:16:30] itcapybara: this is my first time playing
[2:16:33] qteelmao: yeah super fun and exciting alright... yea right
[2:16:37] wavecadet: fun and exiciting for first 3-4 days then sweaty lol a
[2:16:37] docxxd: Parse Police Weeewoo weewoo
[2:16:38] BroodingDoob: it doesn't have to be about sweating, logs are a learning tool
[2:16:39] aackee: making gnomer easier solves the problems for sod tbh
[2:16:47] MikeyMacaroni: just make a separate server for different play styles
[2:16:50] Ervill1: @LilTaisu no but with people like you making such assumptions is exactly proving their point
[2:16:54] scarecrow582: just use logs for more real time tuning...i think
[2:17:01] LilTaisu: @Ervill1 lmao Pepega
[2:17:03] Udenwo: Parsing makes it fun for a lot of players
[2:17:04] Ryzehx: I use my logs to compare to same specs and ananyze where I can improve if they parse higehr than me
[2:17:11] d2jayden: @adam_brisbane that not going to make the people that check inv you they just see that you dont have any logs
[2:17:12] ashraf_ma: why deny a playerbase from playing how they want which is competitively ? @Xaryu removing it would be toxic
[2:17:17] largist_: not sweaty player but logs are still the number 1 way for me to improve my gameplay
[2:17:19] Pragma8123: Best way to combat is to start your own group
[2:17:21] JUSTINDOLLARZ: It's like any arcade feel where you want to see your high score
[2:17:22] roidspands: what’s the difference between sod and retail?
[2:17:25] thehorrorblygreatshow: Add ons are just cheat codes
[2:17:27] BroodingDoob: @Ryzehx this is the way
[2:17:29] Ervill1: @LilTaisu typical answer, i expected no different
[2:17:34] shlagbeans: WCL literally helps you improve. IDK why people don't like it.
[2:17:34] lilodot: Well the problem is the logs are just a tool, but a huge part of the community uses those tools to be toxic af
[2:17:34] ShingaTV: its just statistics? you can feel bad or good about it doesnt matter... it helps people who use it and also with guilds and some it doesnt but they not care about it anyway?
[2:17:38] Adem9x: LUL LUL
[2:17:43] adam_brisbane: @LilTaisu you telling me you can not clear gnome with out purple passes?
[2:17:54] thehorrorblygreatshow: People want consumes and min max but can't play the game in it's natural state. It's a joke
[2:17:55] asloff: Good morning Xarbar, rocking that well rested buff irl?
[2:17:58] klaymiester: Do you just let your tiger defecate all over Azeroth?
[2:17:59] adam_brisbane: @d2jayden Stops people making fun like that person said
[2:17:59] rad_oj: Players love hyper-optimization, although none of the content in SOD requires it
[2:18:05] flitserd: if u wanna parse then join a parse guild if u dont then join the groups who dont
[2:18:06] Micklav: in FF14 logs and dmg meters caused such a hard gatekeeping that SE banned all use even mention of parsing
[2:18:10] Xzanelol: you cant
[2:18:11] blazzedzz: Mabey Chang the lock outs to loot lock out so people aren't afraid to brick there run
[2:18:12] Atruis_: nope
[2:18:14] Atruis_: horde zone
[2:18:14] FrostsWorld: you cant
[2:18:15] KosmicDevil_: ur in horde zone
[2:18:16] chetterbancettv: why is it called retail anyways? like whats the reasoning behind that @Xaryu
[2:18:21] Velius_Grey: they won't be flagged though
[2:18:22] adam_brisbane: you can
[2:18:23] BroodingDoob: @lilodot is shitting on people who utilize logs not also toxic?
[2:18:24] sullyman13: moonfirebeam was able to /duel you in loch modan
[2:18:25] cardonish: The druid was able to dual in loch while flagged
[2:18:31] Xzanelol: its an alliance town
[2:18:32] oJNelly: they unflag
[2:18:32] Eggzactly54: werent you slash dueling in the last phase?
[2:18:34] LilTaisu: @adam_brisbane not what I said, you can full clear with grey parses. People have full cleared with 6 raiders
[2:18:37] snayrofficial: exactly
[2:18:37] deelay0: its the exact same as loch modan is for allies
[2:18:38] KosmicDevil_: you /duel them
[2:18:41] tuna_sandw1ch: @chetterbancettv bc its sold "in stores"
[2:18:45] adam_brisbane: you will be flagged they will be yello to you
[2:18:49] ooTHExTUBEoo: just do a triple jump to signal the start of duel
[2:18:49] oJNelly: this nooob
[2:18:54] oJNelly: jk
[2:18:59] krulfar: AB rep
[2:19:00] asloff: @BroodingDoob it's not what you say, but how you say it
[2:19:00] cardonish: glory
[2:19:02] Anciexnt: @adam_brisbane no he will be yellow to them
[2:19:03] criowa: rep
[2:19:05] qteelmao: aoe change
[2:19:05] Phrosted_: AB rep, honor for p3
[2:19:09] landotherealog: Did he do Gnomer yet?
[2:19:11] sullyman13: buy rank 14
[2:19:14] Fakebutter: fun DansGame
[2:19:16] bpwryl: Are these things a problem if you join a casual guild? Maybe I’m wrong but I feel like pugging was always the inferior experience and you aspired to join a guild but nowadays people complain about the being discriminated in pugs without looking for or starting a guild
[2:19:19] xxenu__: STV fun LUL
[2:19:19] chickodie: did a guild run yesterday for new recruits to try in gnomer, we really need 20 consistent raiders for p3 so i pretty much took anyone. 2 Ranged Hunters, 2 Rogues, Boomkin, and only 3 Core Raiders. We wiped once on Electricutioner and one shot Menagry and Thermaplugg. Optimization is irrelevant at least at this point in SoD
[2:19:19] Glennr16: @Xaryu take the zepplin to stv
[2:19:21] killadalegend: i made a mage in sod Pog
[2:19:28] soulnobi: raptor mount

[2:19:30] BroodingDoob: @asloff agreed
[2:19:31] Tappsters: @Xaryu now you just AOE 10yds from it
[2:19:38] stevecatt: If you weren't a streamer do you think you'd still be playing wow?
[2:19:38] Plokoon100: they changed aoe?
[2:19:38] funsponge247: funsponge247 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:19:39] grubix_hd: do you get 30% commission from each AG1 sale that you promote? I’m thinking about it but been doing a lot of research. seems sketch @xaryu
[2:19:40] nukica: FUN? YOU THINK GAME IS FUN?!
[2:19:41] taglinetv: Living bomb damage is still the same near altar i think
[2:19:42] Vesir_1: aoe dmg not single target
[2:19:42] zyrr: what AOE change?
[2:19:43] Seithr9: single target damage is still full at alter
[2:19:48] deelay0: does the aoe nerf affect the dmg of people inside the circle or the damage in the circle?
[2:19:50] adam_brisbane: @Anciexnt no the horde will be blue yellow to himnot red because he can not attack themif they are pvp off
[2:19:52] jazzyjoff: Thats the sweet spot - because if you stay in the 10y they wont kill you
[2:19:53] haukewood_: you should see how many coins you can get solo
[2:20:03] carneasada34: did you ever kill that blood god?
[2:20:03] Kryptiiq: What change?
[2:20:23] chickodie: @Xaryu ITS LIKE BLIZZARD WOULD BE WATCHING THE SUGGESTIONS OF A 5K STREAMER.
[2:20:25] wigglybob: Man the aoe strat makes my non mage groups think we can spam altar, so dumb
[2:20:28] sullyman13: 6 rogues spamming kek
[2:20:29] Asaf1s: yo! was it hard to take the tiger?
[2:20:31] Anciexnt: @adam_brisbane no shit lol i was refering to who ever said the horde will be yellow to him............

[3:12:56] xvpsp: what is better xaryu disc priest or holy for healing in pvp
[3:12:57] adam_brisbane: ypur coc is 11
[3:12:58] inspect4: i did first event ever as 100% naked ele sham with random noobs and got over 2k for first time ever
[3:12:58] Knocktoff: thats a big xarCoC
[3:13:01] pew2700: Mages in shambles now with the altar change lol.. They actually have to play the game.
[3:13:05] YuraruY: @resume___ not like as a melee hunt u go surv
[3:13:10] resume___: @Reaperz_kinetic okay then how can you argue
[3:13:23] inspect4: melee feels so trash after playing caster in stv
[3:13:24] Highparkk_: @pew2700 what was the change?
[3:13:25] cr1zpylol: I manage to get 1400 coins one time
[3:13:28] reluchan: boring boring SOD
[3:13:30] Selentus: is warrior bad in phase2 or okayisch ?
[3:13:30] resume___: @YuraruY ye you can be whatever spec if your melee hits are more than ranged hits, youre a melee
[3:13:31] bigwilly3737: @pew2700 they already got their coins, gear and the mount weeks ago lol this change was way to late to effect anything
[3:13:43] Highparkk_: @reluchan boring retail weeb?
[3:13:48] cr1zpylol: bad as fyck @selentus
[3:13:48] mello_yollo: am at 1100 this evenmt
[3:13:54] YuraruY: @resume___ i wanted to say. not like as a melee hunt u go surv + cat for first 2 bosses then respec bm + wind serpent for bosses 3-6
[3:13:54] Psycho73x: @reluchan then change the channel
[3:14:14] resume___: @YuraruY that is 100% true you do

[3:14:30] RadicaIED: @Xaryu  Son you winning?
[3:14:50] t1isokatleague: nice heals
[3:15:00] wondrous_shoopuf: Pog
[3:15:08] jfreed7852: lol. did the math for BENGAL mount. Getting 800 copper coins per event, you need 5 events per day for 60 days. no shot
[3:15:18] Highparkk_: @pew2700 what was the altar change?
[3:15:27] bigwilly3737: @jfreed7852 800 coins is so low lol
[3:15:30] BlindGiraffe: @jfreed7852 only 30 days if you get 1600
[3:15:32] tigerslap_ow: do bloods exhange into coins?
[3:15:46] bigwilly3737: @jfreed7852 some of these mages got 2000 coins per event
[3:16:00] bigwilly3737: or more
[3:16:01] 4wardsjack: weird they didnt nerf cleave
[3:16:02] aggr0crag32: @bigwilly3737 and tthey fixed that
[3:16:02] jfreed7852: 800 is a good minimum to follow tho. my record was 1600
[3:16:03] Swaggrlol: is there a Bengal mount reward?
[3:16:07] bananaqt408: more like 4000+ coin with a mage group
[3:16:09] inhaledthc: done :D
[3:16:42] resume___: you still frost right?
[3:16:43] STREAMSNYPELUL: instead of players not stacking up and spreading out we had to nerf aoe?
[3:16:47] STREAMSNYPELUL: thanks aggrend
[3:16:51] bigwilly3737: @aggr0crag32 they still got the mount and all their coines lma who cares if they fixed it now when all the mages already got all their coins and mounts lol xaryu got the mount and he didnt do that many events
[3:16:58] bigwilly3737: lmao*
[3:17:19] ChairsHaveFeelings: @jfreed7852 You can buy the Bengal tiger?? lol
[3:17:38] YuraruY: @ChairsHaveFeelings gold saber cat, not bengal
[3:17:52] YuraruY: the one xaryu has
[3:17:56] ChairsHaveFeelings: @YuraruY I figured thats what he meant lmao unless I missed some big news
[3:18:03] jfreed7852: supposedly it’s ZG rep.
[3:18:17] YuraruY: @ChairsHaveFeelings bengal tiger is still a mistery
[3:18:31] enigmasvea: LOL
[3:18:32] dad_kek: yes
[3:18:33] 4wardsjack: no just the ones crying
[3:18:34] TEEEEmac: mage for sure
[3:18:34] Playonwordz: ZF next raid date mine??????
[3:18:35] headkickhero: PepeLaugh
[3:18:36] Kryptiiq: yes
[3:18:38] asloff: dont stand if the fire!!!!!!!
[3:18:39] dad_kek: exactly
[3:18:40] Gbpiii: yes by getting rid of the alter
[3:18:41] STREAMSNYPELUL: if players were smart, just dont go on the aoe. you dont stand in aoe in pve how hard is it to not stand it in pvp?
[3:18:45] asloff: in*
[3:18:50] treyywow: unbelievable
[3:18:53] cr1zpylol: just remive altar lol
[3:18:54] critcobain: Why don't we take bikini bottom, and push it somewhere else
[3:18:55] bigwilly3737: get rid of the alter have another way to turn in coins
[3:18:57] yamzprime: smartest orc player
[3:19:04] enigmasvea: @Xaryu save some coins after just to see you cant turn them in
[3:19:11] LimpsNoodles: no blood cap?
[3:19:12] steelhog90: people will still go boss tho
[3:19:13] TEEEEmac: good idea
[3:19:14] resume___: yeah dont create hotspots
[3:19:16] SailazarAY: EZ
[3:19:16] tigerslap_ow: the alters seem to bring people together
[3:19:16] celestius11: i think thats the play
[3:19:19] bushthebug: just scrap the turn in mechanic and gain coins passively by kills AND healing
[3:19:19] ta_dzz: !server
[3:19:19] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[3:19:19] spacetator: if there was no alters, how would you turn in blood?
[3:19:20] Nimbus723: you'd get stuck at some number of bloods since you lose 10% on death
[3:19:25] ConceptualDesigns: just fight near boss still and blood cashes in at the end
[3:19:26] Nimbus723: prob stuck at like 500
[3:19:30] celestius11: nah still have boss
[3:19:31] rudIey: they shouldve made it impossible to turn in during the event, and make blood loss on death fixed like 10-15 blood loss per death :)
[3:19:32] bigwilly3737: thats how world pvp should be
[3:19:36] Mitalik: Why don't any streamers play hardcore?
[3:19:36] Kersed805: boss still gives extra so gather at boss
[3:19:38] adam_brisbane: to many people
[3:19:39] CoolTV: too man
[3:19:39] macjcool: gurabashi fight club
[3:19:43] resume___: there's gonna be community created hotspots too, but those are "optional" to join
[3:19:43] thedirtylobster: running around finding people would be obnoxious, having a hotspot is needed on this big of a map. remove the troll not the altars
[3:19:46] Darthvendor: i hate people, wouldnt wanna see any
[3:19:46] Catalystic_Sudo: not enough
[3:19:47] STREAMSNYPELUL: its just bad game design by making hot spots and so they punish emergent player behavior instead of fixing the game itself
[3:19:51] tazewell: Increease blood ouput 10% by altars but dont turn in at altars
[3:19:53] STREAMSNYPELUL: everyone is tired of the game devs
[3:19:55] paladan_tich: The problem with no alters is the event dies on Normal (non pvp) servers and it also dies in later phases
[3:19:58] TEEEEmac: just southern STV event
[3:20:02] Webz618: You're also talking about this solution on Crusader Strike which is super populated. I'm on Lava Lash and that would kill our STV experience @Xaryu
[3:20:03] nastiku: blood moon event will be way more fun next phase ;)
[3:20:03] SailazarAY: seeing less people is completely alright
[3:20:05] cr1zpylol: 1 kill = 500 blods 🩸
[3:20:05] enigmasvea: @Xaryu save like 10 coins after just to see you cant turn them in
[3:20:15] jazzyjoff: Even then gamers will find a way to min max
[3:20:16] YuraruY: not having a max blood count so u cant just stack them the whole event and u just turn them in at the end in like booty bay or smth might be good imo
[3:20:25] Twiello: altars are made hotspots, so by removing them people just make their own hotspots XD i see no diffi
[3:20:31] Zandarkun: @Xaryu what about a "sanctuary" a certain yards from the alter?
[3:20:38] TEEEEmac: merge all sod realms
[3:20:43] yung_jed: get rid of altars and add in war mode supply drops all over the map that have bloood in them
[3:20:46] Nuhgsz: or just have the bloods turn into coins when you reach 100 stacks
[3:20:56] griffinwish: chat is the blood moon event hated rn?
[3:21:09] Playonwordz: less ppl is so much better, way more intense when ur roaming and you finally find a squad @Xaryu
[3:21:10] xNotorietyx: you cant cash after now, which is annoying
[3:21:12] GARPAR: Very good
[3:21:13] ricbouro: Blood moon event is so much leave it alone
[3:21:18] ricbah: really nice, highest ive gotten with single target is 1850 was lit
[3:21:23] pwnage4me4free: cant turn in last blood lol
[3:21:23] Mitalik: Why don't any streamers play hardcore?
[3:21:26] Catalystic_Sudo: can’t turn in
[3:21:26] modlost: !build
[3:21:26] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[3:21:26] batchestspam: gotta turn in while events is going now
[3:21:27] critcobain: Meanwhile the most i've gotten was like 400 cause of the insane lag 2 weeks ago lol
[3:21:30] enigmasvea: @Xaryu see you cant trun these coins in now
[3:21:31] pliley: so how does it feel compared?
[3:21:32] Highparkk_: @Mitalik that ship has sailed
[3:21:34] STREAMSNYPELUL: boomkins have able to get 2-3k+ by single targetting for a long time, should we nerf 36 yard instant casts too
[3:21:34] Leobeans: they are still aoe'ing does it still work??
[3:21:34] kaydubz: why you still need blood?
[3:21:35] LimpsNoodles: would allow people to solo easier too
[3:21:36] Nightmareo: Do you think Sunken Temple was the right choice for the raid next phase?
[3:21:38] jazzyjoff: Ppl will go to the LOA because it gives more blood
[3:21:40] enigmasvea: ya its hella annoying
[3:21:42] Nimbus723: I thought you could
[3:21:47] Ilove_togetwet: is that a patch?
[3:21:50] happidiot: you can turn them in at the vendor after event
[3:21:51] robbieonthebeat: what are you spending blood coins on? AB rep? @Xaryu
[3:21:55] Highparkk_: @Nightmareo who said it was?
[3:22:00] maniiieelll: zone is too big for that
[3:22:01] powhatan1: You can turn in bloods at the gurubashi arena after the event
[3:22:03] hclark0: @Xaryu  did they change that? I used to turn in after event
[3:22:03] RickPhilip: @happidiot ^
[3:22:03] Nightmareo: @Highparkk_ datamine
[3:22:05] Nuhgsz: bloods should just auto turn into coins at 100 stacks and remove altars
[3:22:06] STREAMSNYPELUL: make it a battle royale. last man standing. 1 life. the longer you live the more bloods you get.
[3:22:15] Mister_Ript: Basically how the Timeless Isle PvP farm went.
[3:22:16] Playonwordz: @Xaryu u can turn blood in at the arena pretty sure
[3:22:18] Highparkk_: @Nightmareo gross, was hoping for zf
[3:22:19] nastiku: @xaryu i think you just described phase 3 STV
[3:22:20] Skwidlegs: turn solo players into mini-boss blood loa with WG-like buff
[3:22:25] jfreed7852: would suck if ur not on crusader strike. lower pop servers would hate it
[3:22:26] RoaminIrl: I am excited for tol barad in cata
[3:22:30] ricbah: not true

[3:22:39] Nightmareo: @Highparkk_ Too popular they are specifically doing the least popular one in each bracket
[3:22:39] Snewgans: Could not turn in at arena yesterday
[3:22:45] STREAMSNYPELUL: @Reaperz_kinetic said the noob

[3:22:48] LithoSlam: pet the ktty
[3:22:52] S0LSTICEech0: it stopped working last night at the 12am event

[4:08:20] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[4:08:23] ballerdeluxe: well, missile barrage is 2.5 seconds, and ab is 2.5 seconds, so missiles is more dps
[4:08:27] thedirtylobster: you have infinite novas and aoe for the adds
[4:08:29] Witality: does ninjapull count
[4:08:29] macjcool: @Xaryu can we do a "does anyone die" instead
[4:08:36] Bluptuous: ew what kind of protein? like meat? @Xaryu
[4:08:37] Tomix_137: Hey Xar, how are you doing ?
[4:08:41] specialnicky: @Xaryu what is the flavor of the month at eegees this month
[4:08:42] Mister_Ript: @Kanyeeeeeeeeee The hardest part about playing a Mage is spamming trade to sell Portals
[4:08:44] shadowvypers: adds will be key to this fight
[4:08:44] highonacidd: what are your thoughts on kombucha?
[4:08:46] YuraruY: is do we kill this boss in 1 pull or just do we kill this boss overall?
[4:09:00] bigwilly3737: @Bluptuous no like powder lol i hope your trolling
[4:09:03] chr47: It would be trivial to sim tbh
[4:09:12] Reaperz_kinetic: @Kanyeeeeeeeeee its currently a 2 button rotation lol
[4:09:13] Bluptuous: no shot you put meat in your smoothie @Xaryu
[4:09:15] Noobie99: does living flame stack in raid if other mages are also casting at the same time?
[4:09:23] reallyeric: Xaryu are you going to do SODcore again to 40 and try gnomer?
[4:09:35] naturalduck: @Kanyeeeeeeeeee imo harder than other healers. can't handle burst very well
[4:09:57] Bluptuous: IE; it aint happening
[4:10:00] Witality: Do you speak with rav or is he busy
[4:10:01] yami_yugi_87: makes no sense with XP buff
[4:10:01] easyafff: sodcore is awesome
[4:10:04] Iodobol: at least u will have the xp buff
[4:10:08] Kanyeeeeeeeeee: @Reaperz_kinetic isnt there a big skill gap between the percentiles of mage healers
[4:10:21] Bluptuous: true
[4:10:22] gdkpgold: pump boss before the adds spawn xdd
[4:10:28] sighzybtw: is arcane viable in pve for gnomergan?
[4:10:28] iJKOVY: you can turn xp buff off
[4:10:32] Nimbus723: you can turn xp buff off at an inn
[4:10:36] reallyeric: you can opt out of the EXP buff by talking to SW inn keeper
[4:10:36] Highparkk_: @sighzybtw yes its pretty good
[4:10:37] Bluptuous: you do 1.3k dps yet? xaryu
[4:10:37] Ervill1: you can turn it off but how will it be enforced? it cant
[4:10:40] violetcold: @Xaryu you can disable buff at innkeeper
[4:10:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @Kanyeeeeeeeeee it looks that way on logs but tbh idk why there is
[4:10:46] Bakedoutmytree: lvling quick is better in hardcore, cuz youre bound to die
[4:10:47] ScootSmith: tank with back to wall so adds group for aoe
[4:10:51] Drummish: Adge = Badge
[4:10:52] Scnozzberry: Ive heard you can disable it at the inn
[4:10:56] GoodGriffey: I think with the XP buff it makes more sense. The slow content will be quicker to get through
[4:10:58] x_jdot: turn it off EZ
[4:10:58] Reaperz_kinetic: @Kanyeeeeeeeeee ive gotten like 80+ parses every time
[4:11:02] Thunderous_Bastard: ew
[4:11:04] thepoboy8u2: the hardcore aspect is what’s most entertaining anyway. I’d love to see it!
[4:11:04] ninetysix: is it rough ?
[4:11:07] theDRG: get to 40 then turn it off Kappa
[4:11:09] davepyo: Yo Xar, I’m in for the duration today, vibin’ out
[4:11:17] ballerdeluxe: my intuition is that as long as you're not wasting ab stacks, you won't lose damage by doing a 1 stack barrage, since the next ab will just get used for the following barrage. idk how to use sim tools tho
[4:11:26] LilBtheBasedGawd: @Xaryu saw you dueling Hydra earlier were you using living flame and living bomb?
[4:11:29] reallyeric: do you still have ur lvl 25 sodcore toon?
[4:11:33] xaaaaa: one you get 40 on a all green alt what am i supposed to do chat? bfd?
[4:11:38] caesar813: hELLO
[4:11:51] ballerdeluxe: 4 stack barrage is hot af true
[4:12:01] dwewww: isn't fire dps higher than arcane?
[4:12:02] Bluptuous: did you know the main actor from Everything, everywhere, all at once was the chinese kid from Indiana jones
[4:12:03] Reaperz_kinetic: @Kanyeeeeeeeeee i promise its easy
[4:12:09] YuraruY: full mage group
[4:12:10] Highparkk_: @dwewww yeah it is, but arcane is close
[4:12:17] Javee1: warlocks buff mages no?
[4:12:18] resume___: i LOVED TBC arcane mage, where AB became faster cast the more stacks you had. did you ever play arcane in TBC @Xaryu ?
[4:12:22] KilladeathKS: what about mass regen
[4:12:29] Riverxlol: if your warlocks have imp, they give stam buff to party
[4:12:34] Witality: I am only a doubter b/c I can't bet Madge
[4:12:36] speciallboy: @KilladeathKS all he needs to do is cast it on a melee member
[4:12:42] BingoTingler: @Riverxlol was about to say that
[4:12:42] Salionus: @resume___ yea i was sad that AB didnt do that in sod

[4:25:36] davepyo: I’ll tell you where parses are garbage: raiding with 4 other fire mages and you keep a crap ignite rolling for yourself but it sucks for overall raid dps. Plenty of people do this.
[4:25:45] inhaledthc: pay up kekw
[4:25:47] speciallboy: @AceOfFlame im going to assume since you are refusing to post your logs you are 100% exaggerating and this doesnt happen. DPS can pparse grey on bosses, even if they do their job. For example, Spriests can parse grey if they are removing stacks correctly on the last boss.

[5:09:49] abdoun7: you  need priest or druid
[5:09:55] AceOfFlame: the other bosses had overheat on them because person tanking drag didnt pull it away
[5:09:59] grkgemini94: if you get the drake down to 20% first he will stop overheating
[5:10:00] SafetiTwitch: never tank overheat
[5:10:01] bigwilly3737: how do you die to eggs this many weeks into this raid lock in
[5:10:05] HiroJeepsIII: tank always eats it
[5:10:08] araltus791: overheat is not avoidable. its roughly a 15 yd range
[5:10:08] eurolite: meelee needs to run out for overheat so healers can focus the tank heals imo
[5:10:09] villarax: the offtank has to pull dragon away
[5:10:10] HiroJeepsIII: he has aggro
[5:10:15] succaw: someone needs to pull dragon away to avoid overheat

[5:10:24] TwistedFruit: it's a stacking debuff that does dmg
[5:10:24] HiroJeepsIII: melee needs to get out
[5:10:25] skrothO: if tank moves them around faster the dragon will be far enough away from squir/chick so Overheat doesn't land on all 3 of em... @Xaryu
[5:10:28] jeneraljelly: The Dragon tank will eat it
[5:10:30] eurolite: 15 yard range on over heat

[5:10:38] Widd: melee can just step out for a few seconds
[5:10:38] tzeibeer: @xaryu use buttons every cooldown then u can blast it 💪💪💪
[5:10:39] Nandrolone11: dragon buffs over heat if too close to other mobs
[5:10:39] Salionus: depends on where dragon is during cast
[5:10:43] bigwilly3737: i dont think half of these gnomes have ran this before

[5:11:07] succaw: dragon casts overheat on them @Xaryu
[5:11:12] skrothO: overheat, just like sheep reflection, is cast on Nearby entities... so it will land on several if they're stacked @Xaryu 5Head
[5:11:12] intelwithinpodcast: @celestius11 whats his name? im gonna look it up
[5:11:14] AceOfFlame: @araltus791 overheat happens on drag and then it spreads dude when drag is close
[5:11:22] celestius11: @intelwithinpodcast bennybigtoes
[5:11:24] Shreddingly: Pulling whelp to sheep before overheat allows sheep to die faster and avoid 3xoverheat on 4 melee in group
