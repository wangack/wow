[1:34:49] avenueone: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic/guides/how-to-get-the-cozy-sleeping-bag-in-season-of-discovery/
[1:39:03] Catharsus: @avenueone do you know if it stacks if multiple people use in a group, or is just one needed for whole group?
[1:39:22] avenueone: the bag itself u can use anyone in groups
[1:39:23] fanikitotv: !server
[1:39:24] StreamElements: HC - Defias Pillager/Ally | WotLK - Faerline/Horde | SoD - Crusader Strike
[1:39:37] avenueone: stacks to 3% but the biggest part of that imo is the 2 levels of rested xp items
[1:39:48] Catharsus: i got one, and was told you could 'stack the buff' and only thing i can see is it goes to 3% for 3 hours
[1:40:09] Catharsus: those things are badass, use asap imo
[1:40:12] avenueone: probably whoever told u that had poor wording
[1:40:23] avenueone: just meaning it stacks to 3
[1:40:31] avenueone: i dont think u get different stacks per bag
[1:40:34] Catharsus: what i thought to, wanted to ask someone who is known to know shit though ;)
[1:41:09] avenueone: maybe u can place 3 on same spot and get 3 stacks in 1 minute though i guess?
[1:41:26] Catharsus: dunno, i will test when i get in game again
[1:47:42] reklebin: when do you stop getting bfd buff?

[2:18:41] Anhak: it was 20% KEKW
[2:19:30] Anhak: apparently giving melee 20% attack speed was too strong KEKW
[2:19:55] Anhak: uh u can yes but u cant get bfd buff at 40
[2:20:39] Anhak: its the farm up basicing right north
[2:21:19] Anhak: stonetalon is next so hearth

[2:25:51] Anhak: @sunileif kinda normalzied kinda not
[2:26:08] nikthevoker: preferably in stealth LUL
[2:26:53] Anhak: with no talents runes etc pet dps is normalized among like all cats etc
[2:27:19] sunileif: rogues make terrible pets
[2:27:21] Anhak: but with runes and stuff making pet abilitys more important a slower attacking pet actually buffs those more
[2:27:27] sunileif: they pee on everything
[2:27:42] sunileif: brokentooth isnt a thing?
[2:27:44] Anhak: yea slower is actually better its like counter

[6:34:57] eMBeaR64oz: im sad
[6:35:35] eMBeaR64oz: they should fix lifebloom and nourish to actually heal tho
[6:35:55] eMBeaR64oz: the nourish quest is impossible to do on pvp servers, you auto fail when you land in contested zones because of honorless target
[6:36:09] eMBeaR64oz: i mean 1700 shadow word death hits, non crits
[6:36:17] eMBeaR64oz: 2k two handed enhancement hits
[6:36:36] eMBeaR64oz: some arcane surge one shot too
[6:36:41] eMBeaR64oz: 6s cd
[6:36:49] eMBeaR64oz: highest ive gotten in pvp was almost 1k
[6:36:57] eMBeaR64oz: with all the things aligning
[6:37:42] corbett86: 24 hour stream while sick sounds ROUGH
[6:37:45] eMBeaR64oz: but yeah nourish quest bugged so its actually impossible to do as intended on pvp servers
[6:38:33] eMBeaR64oz: 1hr timer to go from moonglade->stv->swamp of sorrow->arathi->alterac without teleporting or dying, but auto fails when landing with "honorless target" from zepplin or flight path
[6:38:40] eMBeaR64oz: wish theyd fix that kind of thing first :)
[6:38:48] Stormayqt: Hi Mes do you know if you will be playing with Cdew soon/today?

[6:44:39] Rainbowmes: I don’t think this is one you can vaccinate against
[6:44:49] thasthebear: sorry kid, you gotta go to school sick. infest them other kids as payback
[6:44:53] Solushun: just think how many of the ppl at school have parents are fistweavers
[6:45:18] thasthebear: LUL
[6:45:27] Stormayqt: sometimes you have to fight fire with fire
[6:45:33] Anhak: chicken pocks party
[6:46:04] Stormayqt: Ok everyone, time for homeroom. Cough in your neighbors face, then switch partners
[6:46:30] Solushun: chicken pox
[6:46:31] Anhak: RSV
[6:46:33] Stormayqt: Pocks partys were a real thing unfortunately
[6:46:42] Solushun: i got farmed by chicken pox
[6:46:44] corbett86: some anti vaxers
[6:46:59] Solushun: i still got like 2 scars where i picked

[6:49:38] sunileif: ave is an anti-vaxer
[6:49:43] sunileif: anhak is too
[6:49:48] Mad_Grim: a vaccine doesn't make you immune, just less likely.
[6:49:59] Anhak: KKona hell yea brother
[6:50:02] sunileif: thats nto how vaccines work...
[6:50:55] Anhak: its antibodys to make your body know how to fight stuff off better its not a true immunity like bubble in wow
[6:51:33] Anhak: o i know im just explaning what the do
[6:51:53] Anhak: i just have a fear of needles
[6:52:00] sunileif: why ?
[6:52:10] sunileif: whats a needle ever done to you?
[6:52:16] sunileif: but he;lp you
[6:52:22] Anhak: HELP?
[6:52:27] sunileif: that is unless... nvm i dun wanna know
[6:52:33] zachgamegodx: yo mes

[6:52:46] Stormayqt: I have the Alexander Volkanovski of immune systems. It's old but you wouldn't say that to its face
[6:52:51] zachgamegodx: about the outlaw rogue dh thing
[6:53:04] zachgamegodx: i shouldn't assert my opinions so forcefully
[6:53:08] sunileif: hey if you think its cause of the pain ive had some nurses stab me with a needle and i felt nothign
[6:53:17] sunileif: ofc i also watch
[6:53:21] zachgamegodx: feeling sick man?
[6:53:26] eMBeaR64oz: i feel like surge already nerfed
[6:53:29] Stormayqt: some nurses are actual wizards
[6:53:30] eMBeaR64oz: its doing like no dam in pvp
[6:53:50] thasthebear: @sunileif as a nurse can confirm... the person giving the shot makes a ton of difference
[6:53:53] zachgamegodx: you're locked into the 24 hours on a sub goal/donation or can you back out?
[6:54:06] eMBeaR64oz: yeah just had a dreamstate crit on a mob, 600 dam
[6:54:09] eMBeaR64oz: as oppose to like 1k+
[6:54:20] Anhak: THANK GOD MIKE
[6:54:28] Anhak: i know it probably feels bad but it was such a problem..
[6:54:35] sunileif: mes why you afraid of needles?
[6:54:39] zachgamegodx: oh that makes sense, you know your limits better than me

[7:19:19] Vigi9413: how's sod going
[7:24:25] GoGoGarrett: I feel like the leveling weak aura could be a little bigger; hard to read PepeLaugh
[7:25:27] Vigi9413: oh i thought you were just muted for a bit lol
[7:26:11] Vigi9413: you're fine
[7:26:19] Vigi9413: is this a 24 hour sod only stream?
[7:27:18] Vigi9413: you think it's acceptable to que solo on a fresh toon in all green  pvp gear or will i get eaten currently lol
[7:28:08] Vigi9413: i have a warrior/ret/dh
[7:28:26] Vigi9413: but just coming back the warrior for some reason still has S1 MMR with no gear
[7:28:31] Vigi9413: so that's no bueno
[7:30:00] Vigi9413: figured now was a good time to come back and get back on the wagon since wrath is gonna be the same thing for another 5 motnhs

[7:35:20] Anhak: Kermit: Tank players deserve a death in a shadowy dule
[7:35:40] Anhak: KEKW
[7:35:48] Anhak: prob
[7:37:36] Anhak: i dont like the mechanic of shadowy duel it leads to some cool plays but i honestly think its something that probably should go
[7:38:17] Anhak: ive been a very long time advocate for bomb returning to rogues base kid and brining back 20% DR for pve use
[7:38:30] Anhak: base kit *
[7:39:10] Anhak: even 10% dr idc it was really cool in cata and mop
[7:39:27] Anhak: also as soon as they lost that rogues basicly lost a raid spot

Every other MMO feels like a child compared to WoW competitive scene. GW2 was close with PVP.

[20:16:01] sunileif: Ive been trying to think of creative ways to nerf dh and all i got is lower their hp by 7%
[20:17:07] notdustinx: dh has its downfalls
[20:17:35] sunileif: Thus making the positioning more questionable

[21:15:35] easybola: VoHiYo
[21:16:46] c0jaK: did i miss why vampire survivors
[21:22:02] rtcinema: I'm really curious how they plan to incentivize classic players with it
[21:22:22] rtcinema: They claim you don't need dragonflight or war within to participate
[21:22:41] rtcinema: So whatever the patch brings is independent of character power
[21:23:10] rtcinema: Yeah, but they could be doing a GW2 character scaling for it too though
[21:23:18] rtcinema: Which would be interesting
[21:24:13] rtcinema: In GW2 once you got to level 5 you could do a BGs. Going to the PVP zone automatically made you max level and unlocked all gear on a vendor
[21:24:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think this 10.2.6 event is going to be on many servers
[21:24:32] rtcinema: But Wow has never done anything like that before
[21:24:57] KJBirl: What goes into the thought process of picking a comp? just what performs good on ladder?
[21:25:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could add the event to Wrath and even SOD, along with retail having its own version of the event
[21:25:46] rtcinema: Yeah, it's a retail patch specifically
[21:25:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: If they have balls then they add it to vanilla, but I wouldn't touch vanilla
[21:26:30] Rainbowmes: time to run me through ring of blood in wrath
[21:26:50] Rainbowmes: fuckkkk
[21:26:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I am hoping it's a pirate invasion kind of event
[21:27:20] Rainbowmes: brickedupmes closing in on 80
[21:28:21] americanmoses18: BRICKED UP MES
[21:28:52] steroiids22: do we think they gonna be till 9am pst before theyre up?
[21:29:26] JuiceBoxDrizzle: Is this just a restart or is something going on this patch?
[21:30:07] Jackietothemoon: is this gonna take the full 2 hours?
[21:30:18] steroiids22: i was under the impression just reset but its almost patch time
[21:30:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah server stuff
[21:30:59] steroiids22: have they said when this season ends?
[21:31:29] Jackietothemoon: probably another 4-5 weeks
[21:31:40] Nethylol: !wa
[21:31:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: The season might not change over exactly when 10.2.6 drops, I heard
[21:31:40] StreamElements: Dragonflight: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3
[21:33:15] Dreadrend: Hey mes and chat
[21:33:22] steroiids22: would like to see it go to end of marxh
[21:33:46] bobbybigbuxx: hey Mes, thank you for your service to the pvp community and wow in general. You are a rockstar!
[21:34:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the last week or so of the season is going to be action-packed for PvP with a lot of people pushing for final ranking, like the last one
[21:34:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: I kind of liked it, watching people do their rank 1 pushes
[21:34:42] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[21:35:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: arrrrrrgh
[21:36:00] americanmoses18: PIRATES ARGHHH
[21:36:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't know if it's going to PTR
[21:36:45] americanmoses18: it wont go to ptr its gunna be a super hard surprise launch
[21:37:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: There would be internal versions of the patch they test, that's for sure
[21:37:37] Vigi9413: does bellular still shit on everything retail
[21:37:52] shugguls: how olds this one?
[21:37:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: Bellular is master of click bait LUL
[21:38:18] shugguls: her him and supertease have like 12 vids a day
[21:39:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Enforcing the GDKP ban is the hardest part of that
[21:41:34] rtcinema: I mean... Is people selling an item in group loot really worse than someone getting an item in personal loot and being banned from trading it cause it's 3 IL higher than their current equipped item?
[21:41:57] rtcinema: I feel like personal loot had way worse systemic issues
[21:42:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: With Discord channels and such, it's basically impossible to stop GDKP-type things unless they interfere with trading, yeah
[21:43:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: More anti-botting tech is good, I still see them in retail pretty regularly
[21:45:31] americanmoses18: ELE BOTS thats why i play enhance cant bot that class XD
[21:45:44] americanmoses18: or spriest bots
[21:45:49] rtcinema: Yeah, GDKPs incentivize buying gold, but someone maybe selling an item they need roll on in group loot isn't that common.
[21:46:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are harvesting bots flying  around in Zaralek cavern that are pretty easy to spot
[21:46:46] rtcinema: My favorite is when you use to see 20+ druids running around herbing
[21:46:55] rtcinema: All going on the same route
[21:48:06] Mortifiedwow: You're telling me they are literally teleworking from node to node anymore?
[21:48:24] Mortifiedwow: Teleporting *
[21:48:48] cookietime95: wait we getting drunk in 123 subs?
[21:49:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: I haven't seen teleporting ones lately, I think that server tech could recognize those more easily
[21:49:49] rtcinema: Yeah the rapid movement was much easier to detect
[21:50:29] rtcinema: Although in classic rogues and mages flying around mining/herbing was very common during early launch
[21:50:42] americanmoses18: woah only 123 subs more for drankin?
[21:51:01] rtcinema: Actually, it was being zone during ZG so maybe it was later classic
[21:51:32] rtcinema: I can't imagine Mes doing a drunk stream
[21:51:44] rtcinema: I think it calls for live cam during it :)
[21:52:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: I heard there are going to be some SOD changes this week, kind of tuning things some
[21:52:17] Mortifiedwow: Mes pretending to drink during a drinking stream GASP
[21:52:39] sunileif: Mes sock?

[21:58:44] al_capow: hi
[21:59:21] al_capow: im sorry I missed running with you guys ;( I ended up no lifeing with a guild I ran into awhile back
[21:59:31] al_capow: we cleared managerie 5/6 but wiped on final boss and called it
[21:59:32] Mortifiedwow: @notmes we play klunker in discord games when wow is down tbh
[21:59:37] al_capow: but we got the epic helm recipes
[21:59:56] al_capow: the managerie was definitely a raid killer tho
[22:00:00] al_capow: rip pugs on it
[22:00:01] woollord: any idea on when servers coming back up man?
[22:00:37] al_capow: what did you guys end up looting?
[22:00:45] TheBackstabi: It took our guild run so long to get Menagerie
[22:01:14] al_capow: not what we did
[22:01:26] al_capow: we had main and off tank, one tank holds dragon and squirrel, other chicken
[22:01:39] TheBackstabi: We had a DPS lock "tanking" the sheep, real tanks on the other 3. One held dragon, other held the chicken and squirrel
[22:01:41] al_capow: and you just go in a circle while range dps the sheep
[22:02:00] al_capow: yea
[22:02:18] keeindordel: make wow come up already mes
[22:02:22] keeindordel: i wanna be in ur fyrak heroic
[22:02:27] al_capow: the sheep sucks for sure tho, but it's a fun fight
[22:02:48] sunileif: Mes real talk segment?
[22:02:52] keeindordel: how do u get a blizzard email address?
[22:03:25] al_capow: looks like sod servers are starting to boot up
[22:03:32] Mortifiedwow: You make your account before when they had usernames
[22:03:38] Mortifiedwow: I believe
[22:03:50] al_capow: also the blood moon event is so insane
[22:03:52] al_capow: so much chaos
[22:04:10] Mortifiedwow: Ohh
[22:04:31] keeindordel: what is this :bklood moon" event keep hearing about it
[22:04:37] keeindordel: i know its on SOD
[22:04:39] keeindordel: but what is it
[22:04:47] Mortifiedwow: SoD STV pvp event
[22:05:07] al_capow: it's a literal blood bath
[22:05:09] Mortifiedwow: Everyone becomes hostile
[22:05:17] keeindordel: who dominates on crusader strike horde or alliance?
[22:05:26] Mortifiedwow: It's  1 v everyone
[22:05:29] al_capow: it's basically a wow clone of the D4 pvp areas tho
[22:05:49] keeindordel: what class is good in SoD for pvp?
[22:05:52] Mortifiedwow: Everyone gets the arena flag as if you had stepped inside gurubashi
[22:06:08] keeindordel: how are enhancment shamans?
[22:06:48] al_capow: amazing
[22:06:55] steroiids22: mes do some high keys baby
[22:06:57] keeindordel: 2h or dual-wield?
[22:07:04] al_capow: you really really need maelstrom rune though
[22:07:11] al_capow: dual wield is a blast
[22:07:23] keeindordel: yes
[22:07:26] nikthevoker: goddam servers still not baack up
[22:07:27] keeindordel: but  im onmly lvl 15
[22:07:32] al_capow: yeah I'm trying out sham tanking, it's a lot of fun
[22:07:33] keeindordel: tryna find motivation to lvl it
[22:07:39] al_capow: and like spellhance enh
[22:07:45] nikthevoker: i had enough time for med run and back LUL
[22:08:03] al_capow: mes what day are you running lockout this week? I actually can't make my guilds on friday
[22:08:18] keeindordel: is it better to do heroic fyrak
[22:08:23] keeindordel: or lfr>nromal>heroic?
[22:08:58] keeindordel: for the legendary
[22:09:04] steroiids22: ^^ that’s the big question
[22:09:05] keeindordel: 3 small chances or 1 big chance?
[22:09:23] rtcinema: It's always 3 small chances
[22:09:26] steroiids22: I think best on heroic but love to hear peoples takes
[22:09:33] rtcinema: When you kill it on Heroic it rolls 3 times
[22:09:40] steroiids22: I do heroic normal then LFR
[22:09:44] rtcinema: If you havent done normal or LFR yet
[22:09:52] steroiids22: prob waste of time to do normal and LFR
[22:09:52] keeindordel: lol u wasting ur time doing  backwards
[22:09:59] steroiids22: but I grind
[22:10:00] keeindordel: if u kill it on heroic it eats uop normal and LFR rolls
[22:10:10] steroiids22: so
[22:10:18] steroiids22: is it better to do LFR normal then heroic?
[22:10:25] steroiids22: or just take the heroic chance insta
[22:10:27] steroiids22: yeah
[22:10:27] keeindordel: so u r doing normal and LFR with 0% chance rolls on legendary
[22:10:35] keeindordel: if u killed it on heroic first
[22:10:42] steroiids22: I figured I was
[22:10:51] steroiids22: but I’d rather waste time than waste a shot at it Lolol
[22:10:55] rtcinema: But they don't add the rolls on higher difficulty. They are roll independently to not skew results on heroic compared to doing them independently
[22:11:01] steroiids22: wish blizzard was much more black and white about it
[22:11:28] rtcinema: I've seen multiple people get the greater ember at the legdendary at the same time
[22:11:36] sunileif: wish blizz would nerf rogue and dh
[22:11:45] keeindordel: wish blizzard would nerf rost dk again
[22:11:45] Rainbowmes: just rogues
[22:11:50] rtcinema: Cause the heroic roll failed and gave them the ember, but the normal or lfr roll after was successful
[22:11:51] keeindordel: nerf all classes
[22:11:54] keeindordel: nerf lock defenses
[22:11:55] americanmoses18: fucking rng legendaries. this will be week 13 or sum shit i aint seeing that mofo ever
[22:11:59] keeindordel: nerf mage roots
[22:12:00] sunileif: hmmm frost dk does need more nerfs
[22:12:03] keeindordel: nerf druid cyclones
[22:12:06] steroiids22: it should also be geindable. no loot table after killing it but you should be able to kill heroic fyrakk multiple times and give a small small chance the times after first kill
[22:12:08] keeindordel: nerf unholy dk daamge
[22:12:12] keeindordel: nerf warrior charge
[22:12:14] keeindordel: nerf rogues
[22:12:22] rtcinema: "The average player should see it drop after 8-10 weeks"
[22:12:25] rtcinema: kekw
[22:12:29] shugguls: hope so, just reduce some DH damage and a bit off dark pact
[22:12:33] americanmoses18: lol that was a fuckin lieeee
[22:12:33] steroiids22: cuz I’d kill fyrakk 100 Timees a week lol

[22:12:59] keeindordel: its bullshit
[22:13:10] keeindordel: liquid*
[22:13:28] oaasp: when is the end of season and new raid ?
[22:13:40] keeindordel: looking at march
[22:13:41] keeindordel: so far
[22:13:53] steroiids22: it’s super sad you can’t grind it. for players that spend so much time grinding rating etc you shouldn’t spend a season without getting it while doing everything you can to get it
[22:13:56] steroiids22: kinda toxic
[22:14:02] americanmoses18: new raid for retail? aint no new raid its repeated raids
[22:14:06] americanmoses18: fated season* lol
[22:14:10] steroiids22: esp when it’s a 7% dmg increase
[22:14:48] steroiids22: fated raid sucks. not a fan. except you can buy gear, which should be available for all seasons
[22:14:49] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[22:15:12] nimzzzlock: 10.2.6 drops in March we will probably have a month or so of whatever that brings so maybe 6-8 weeks left possibly more
[22:15:27] steroiids22: raid loot table should be the same as pvp loot table, you can use tokens or points to buy the gear you’ve been grinding and haven’t had drop.
[22:15:36] sunileif: 10.2.6 is the addition of playable murlocs
[22:15:58] sunileif: in march yes so itll be the march of the murlocs <,<
[22:16:03] nimzzzlock: It was mentioned to have something to do with season of discovery
[22:16:06] steroiids22: I was told mid March to mid April for end of season
[22:16:38] steroiids22: I thought I saw March 19 for 10.2.6
[22:16:45] oaasp: what is next raid ?
[22:16:53] steroiids22: but I could be dreaming about wow
[22:16:58] sunileif: kinda of a blank statement of 'been told' been told by whom?
[22:16:59] nimzzzlock: But they will not allow a pet for it so March of the Murloks sounds good to me lol
[22:17:01] nikthevoker: i really need to buy the expac LUL
[22:17:02] steroiids22: dreams of not getting leggo
[22:17:03] shugguls: @oaasp its a rotation of the 3 we have
[22:17:04] steroiids22: hahahaha
[22:17:16] americanmoses18: no new retail raid @oaasp
[22:17:19] sunileif: you got them dev conects or you just spitting words out?
[22:17:24] nimzzzlock: Ptr* not pet
[22:17:32] al_capow: I kinda hope sod p2 doesn't end until end of june

[22:20:59] oaasp: im in
[22:21:04] keeindordel: the hero talents are literally just tier set bonuses
[22:21:08] keeindordel: very underwhelming
[22:21:14] keeindordel: and most of time seem cosmetic
