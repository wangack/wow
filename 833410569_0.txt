[2:16:00] Kinghorn: you cant finish callings in M+, you dont get avowed rep in M+
[2:16:07] Bigbharash: the only good thing about the DoS is the last boss, otherwise its so damn boring
[2:16:07] zeeAbe: There is an anima drought going on ;)
[2:16:23] Shyme_J: Maybe they dun want you overgrind and burn yourself too early?
[2:16:26] Ookagari_: honstly it should scale with key but it dont
[2:16:27] tomkc518: yeah, all the anima on its way to the maw
[2:16:46] CritcobainTV: I need people to get on in my guild so i can do my 9 NW :(
[2:16:51] talic420: wish there was a way to get more redeemed souls a week
[2:17:00] Grankish: thats why you play druid lol
[2:17:00] crrdsh: BloodTrail
[2:17:01] Megadisaster24: yeah
[2:17:11] AureliusXV: anima is pointless
[2:17:24] metavahn231: good thing most of the systems are pointless for most players
[2:17:24] Molvonos: @talic420 There is, you need higher reknown ranks though
[2:17:36] Pablo1983: Is their not supposed to be a Anima drought
[2:17:41] Molvonos: @Towelliee Sent you some ore
[2:17:45] ExtreemeCheese: I see anima as very different from artifact power. Anima doesn't equate to more power. It's just a currency
[2:17:48] metavahn231: only mandatory is torghast
[2:17:55] ListeningClose: is anima really that important even? i havent had an issue doing my 1k weekly and have had more than enough for everything ive wanted so far, starting on the rest of the t2 upgrades rn
[2:17:56] jbeastb: @Towelliee All it's managed to do for me is make it feel worthless to grind and therefore I lost interest in Anima all together
[2:17:56] MrGattz: idk why we cant just get a small amount of a currency for killing all bosses. that way eventually we can just buy a piece of loot that we know we actually need after so many runs
[2:18:00] skylaars: whats FWACATA stand for?

[2:20:54] skylaars: rip
[2:20:59] skdmaster: Your guys heal 25% faster
[2:20:59] metavahn231: are they going to tune covenants today?
[2:21:22] LoremasterMarthan: I think with how many people have used the table to farm gold with alts in the past, they are afraid to just do anything useful with it
[2:21:24] skylaars: widowbloom is a mother fucker to farm god damn
[2:21:26] Ezekyler: the upgrades are faster missions and heal recovery, maybe rewards gets an upgrades but it will be hide
[2:21:43] DehCantao: I missed, what did Max say yesterday?
[2:21:46] sarcilav: at least 185

[2:26:16] Megadisaster24: it's the dead skin between the buttons, it happens to me too
[2:26:20] jerexify: I'm using the Logitech G600 with the third ring-finger button disabled, and it works like a charm.
[2:26:22] Dimpixels: @towelliee is it worth rerolling to pro Pali or do you think prot war might become good
[2:26:24] BlewGamingGroup: @jerexify yea ... first one was double clicking.... second one ended up having to almost use a hammer on it to get the left click to register ... ended up buying a lotitech
[2:26:26] XrayPunk: You can use WD-40 on it. It's non-conductive. Just a little squirt
[2:26:36] GhostFace_23: my gen2 naga feels plasticy and all but the buttons are still perfect after 4 years

[2:30:31] Ragnarage95: @Towelliee what do you think of the raid, do you think its overturned or is it just people are used to being stronger cause of titan forging

[3:01:59] DeanoTV: honestly feels like the less loot could kill it for casuals
[3:02:03] Versher777: TowGold
[3:02:09] gfield2k: I'm seeing that happening to a lot of tanks @Towelliee
[3:02:12] Versher777: towGold
[3:02:16] twowheelsonelife: I went 11 bosses no loot just to get a ring that I already have minus the socket that came on the ring I already had lol. Feelsbadman
[3:02:16] DeanoTV: heard someone done 6 m+ with 0 loot
[3:02:33] ybp100: What is your favorite tank to play right now
[3:02:42] ssjw1337: Im used to not getting loot :)
[3:02:55] klaymiester: casual here, haven't even started raiding or doing M+. Just finished torgast this morning
[3:03:05] ListeningClose: im pretty casual and at 187 ilvl rn, pugged first 2 bosses in the raid and have been running +3 and +4s as a prot pally, having a balst
[3:03:05] FlySkeez: im really needing to find out what i can do to make some gold lmao
[3:03:06] PapaSix: ive done 11 m+ not a single piece of loot
[3:03:06] Lesrek: The casuals in my guild quit m+ already. If you can only run a couple dungeons a week and you don't get any loot, its horrid
[3:03:21] ListeningClose: probably the most casual friendly expac ever since theres so few chores u have to do
[3:03:26] Spykex02: after work last night i did a +2 spire, +4 theater, +2 mist, +0 de other side, and got 0 loot
[3:03:45] KonradGM: ffs amazon I ALREADY WATCHED THE BOYS FFS
[3:04:00] metavahn231: is a +4 in the works for a casul
[3:04:00] Zastrow_DM: @KonradGM just sub :D
[3:04:02] Shrenko: ^ LUL
[3:04:07] thebakeriscomingforu: As a casual going at a slower pace than my guildies this expansion isn't to bad on gearing
[3:04:15] OnceAMoose: We are still pounding out the 0's for the gearing up of undergeared. And just running +2s and not worrying about depleting and teaching the casuals that more damage and healing is need and faster.
[3:04:18] PracTlKaL: LUL
[3:04:20] Raanoren: im casual and don't run dungeons so I have no where to get gear now.
[3:04:20] DecayedmiNt: It'll take months to get BiS too. Even for people like Limit and Echo. Not a bad thing either really.
[3:04:33] metavahn231: end of dungeon rewards are so trash now, or you just dont get anything at all
[3:04:46] daniel85mg: seems like the vault, is a BIG thing
[3:04:49] DazzCorrupt: its annoying
[3:05:00] ListeningClose: as a casual just having the cache and putting in my time towards getting more cache options makes me not care about not getting loot in M+ as much, knowing ill get a good upgrade at the end of every week
[3:05:02] metavahn231: like they just want you to do 3 M+'s and then log off
[3:05:02] Deathkanigit101: i don't think you will see complaining you just want see people staying.
[3:05:05] Deathkanigit101: it will change
[3:05:10] maalow: it can be frustrating but i feel like you are truly happy to get an upgrade lol
[3:05:16] superninjaaen: tooow, c an i see ur talent? :D
[3:05:18] DazzCorrupt: i ran 5 m3 in a row yesterday and got no loot except conduits for other specs then my main
[3:05:19] PracTlKaL: DPS has been my guilds issue we had to drop a few. Mechanics pretty easily solved after 1-2 fights
[3:05:29] DecayedmiNt: People haven't been used to having a gear grind. People will bitch and moan while they adapt
[3:05:35] Kromede: buy usefull things, not shit
[3:05:44] PvtHudson093: bring back bonus rolls that give guaranteed loot when used

[3:05:46] WebsterLou: wtf
[3:05:46] PracTlKaL: What gear grind???
[3:06:01] Gambit2012: @polewick same for us
[3:06:05] Galadeon: Loot drops less; we killed 5 bosses last night and I got loot off of 3 of them.
[3:06:05] sdpercussion: @Towelliee 8 adds wtf?
[3:06:10] DecayedmiNt: @Polewick Getting BiS will take months.
[3:06:21] Buckwink: we had a warlock freak out on sludgefist and had to be g kicked LULW
[3:06:25] Naturalbeef: I'll take a gear grind over an AP grind any day of the week.
[3:06:28] Libbzy: its cheaper to just buy the waistguard off the aha
[3:06:33] Libbzy: ah*
[3:06:33] Dvy1: @Towelliee you can get it cheaper from the per aligned vendours
[3:06:41] PracTlKaL: Bis has been like that since vanilla??? @Synthetiktek
[3:06:41] Dvy1: REP
[3:07:09] ssjw1337: yo , how do I get 3 million gold fast?
[3:07:09] DecayedmiNt: @Polewick We didn't really have BiS lists in Legion/BfA until the corruption vendor came out
[3:07:10] thebakeriscomingforu: @Naturalbeef agreed. This gear grind is still nothing from the "old days".
[3:07:13] minirine_: bro ive run spires trying to get the bow like 7x on M+ this morning
[3:07:16] RocketMan23: FOMO
[3:07:17] minirine_: ive not gotten a single item
[3:07:20] sarcanthanos: i already feel like im behind
[3:07:21] ListeningClose: yeah i mean what else are we playing to progress for if not gear, id rather not be full bis a month into the expac feeling like i have no options to get gear if im on alone
[3:07:39] PracTlKaL: BiS is always going to change aside from maybe memories @Synthetiktek
[3:07:58] Dragonsland7: wait, you mean I wont be ilvl 200 by next week????
[3:08:05] jbeastb: there are no other outlets for catchup... WQ items? Rare and low shit ilvl... you either grind pvp or do m+ with shit drop rates.. i think they need to add more drops
[3:08:06] Megadisaster24: I've been stuck at 182 since Mythic opened up, struggle is real
[3:08:08] IxProNoobxI: Torghast is the most frustrating thing in this expansion for me
[3:08:13] TheUnknowing: I think blizz will at some point buff drops but we will just see, definitely feels like they are being stingy with loot though.
[3:08:20] Clay2K_: So you have to craft the blanks to get a higher rank that creates higher Ilvl?
[3:08:20] PvtHudson093: I think blizz have go too far the other way compared to the last 2 expacs
[3:08:26] fluh_: im chillin but i know how the casuals feel cuz my guild doesnt wanna do shit with the raid till this weekend
[3:08:31] Naturalbeef: @thebakeriscomingforu Definitely.
[3:08:38] DecayedmiNt: @Polewick It'll change with tiers, but the fact you can get BiS per tier now instead of getting lucky and not having to replace a piece in a new tier is what I'm talking about. We have pure BiS lists now.
[3:08:41] HackerMan37: its 15 crats to get to the next rank for every rank apparently according to wowhead
[3:08:52] Buckwink: i love it, it feels like old wow expansions
[3:09:07] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: @Towelliee The problem for me is, if I'm in a dungeon and 5+ pieces of loot drop and I don't get any. I feel shafted/like my time was wasted. If only 4, okay that's just RNG. But if 5+ drop, I expect to get a piece.
[3:09:10] ListeningClose: of course theres no catch up mechanics in at expac launch there never is and they add them later on once they see a need
[3:09:28] PracTlKaL: You're talking about memories @Synthetiktek
[3:09:45] bikerbrosman: Chest or boots
[3:09:50] thebakeriscomingforu: catch up stuff will come later on in big patches

[3:10:43] mazemonster: hi
[3:10:46] TeritoTV: @Polewick no he's talking about Bis, it was mostly gone during titanforging - because titanforged versions of non-BiS pieces would outperform ideally better pieces, all of that is cleared up now
[3:11:40] Kerfuffles_: question for chat please: I would like to start jewelcrafting. Is it like the old days where you had to grind through all other expansions before you can create Shadowland level gems? danHmm

[3:20:03] OrieleHS: mage was trying hard but not staying in LOS of his healer XD
[3:20:06] jtrue10: can i get more defensives on my sub rogue please :P <3 <3
[3:20:10] J_Walch: lol
[3:20:30] HotHotHeals: 30 people on sludefist is impossible
[3:20:39] HotHotHeals: the tooning for the rubble is broken
[3:20:39] ZealotryTV: @jtrue10 dont need defensives when you can solo someone in a cheap shot
[3:20:41] twowheelsonelife: It is a super tank intensive fight I would imagine
[3:20:50] jeneraljelly: isnt it generally easier with more people? that not true so far in castle?
[3:20:50] PracTlKaL: Yes, we ended up dropping 5 over 1 because of his dps but the other were just natural selection. lol
[3:21:00] SSD511_: Man I love the gearing system it’s way better and rewarding
[3:21:02] PracTlKaL: 20 man was making it mucccchhhhhhh easier
[3:21:17] jtrue10: @ZealotryTV haha :P
[3:21:29] TeritoTV: I think Limit kept 30 - but they would very nearly agree. with 30 just too much rubble
[3:21:47] HotHotHeals: limit killed it by spamming DK zones and slings. They barley killed him and it well after the 4th charge
[3:21:58] Daggerstry: Reset is in an hour right?

[3:57:42] westelan_: i missed the end of the raid last night. how did it go?
[3:57:44] epicsweet09: you want to be ilvl165 before you start mythic
[3:57:51] nihilistic_bat: mythic is anytime, but to get in randos I would rec looking for the world chill in your search at "lower" ilvls
[3:57:54] itscityboy: how do you start mythics then?
[3:57:55] minirine_: right click your character portrait, set mythic dung difficulty, enter dung
[3:58:04] itscityboy: @riley_minirine thanks
[3:58:09] BlewGamingGroup: @mfaxell you will need to run heroics to get a chance at gear upgrading to 184 . until you hit about 170-175+ most people are going to look past you to do mythics
[3:58:32] jerexify: Question for chat, since I'm planning on Huntering some this expansion and don't want to be a complete waste of space... Towelliee is referring to Tranq Shot when he says Soothe, right?
[3:58:33] nihilistic_bat: @riley_minirine that is over simplified for sure
[3:58:40] minirine_: i did mythics at ilvl 140
[3:58:45] minirine_: but i was in a guild group
[3:58:46] nihilistic_bat: @jerexify yes indeed
[3:58:47] minirine_: so idk
[3:58:57] jerexify: @cubertin OK, cool. Thank you.

[4:00:42] Allvarez: looks like UH and MM are just op
[4:00:43] thesk3lly: What's the name of the M+ timer addon you're using?
[4:00:46] poorhooligans: is unholy getting nerfed today? tune in later!
[4:00:48] br0fest0r: Unholy AoE is nutty
[4:00:50] jure__: I honestly hope they don't nerf any spec and start buffing the underperforming ones...
[4:00:52] Boku_No_Darling: I hope if UH does get a nerf, its only to single target a bit, they were always AoE gods
[4:01:07] Allvarez: yeah their AoE makes sense to be OP

[4:01:11] Allvarez: just tone down the ST
[4:01:37] nihilistic_bat: gotta love it when 5-0 is hovering over your apt complex at 9am.
[4:01:42] Boku_No_Darling: The thing is though, if you nerf ST by scaling mastery back (most likely) it changes their cov choice significantly
[4:02:02] Boku_No_Darling: Which I think blizz is trying to avoid, they're in a tough spot
[4:02:23] Allvarez: yeah
[4:02:32] Allvarez: but they backed themselves into a corner with balance lol
[4:02:56] Boku_No_Darling: its crazy because UH in itself is unbalance, but all their cov choices right now are so close you could feasibly pick any of them, which is the perfect balance blizz wanted to achieve
[4:03:04] jure__: and MM isnt even OP, its just that 15 second burst window where they pop every CD they have, after that is over, they are pretty much average
[4:03:33] Buckwink: 7 ads? twitch please
[4:03:35] martyyy_b: what name plates is towelliee using?

[4:08:43] notademon: depends on the dungeon, some release spots are close while others arent.
[4:08:45] mackh2012: whats the addon for the timer?
