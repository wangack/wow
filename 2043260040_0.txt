[0:10:22] nameyourform: YOOO
[0:10:26] zachgamegodx: it's so weird from our perspective as we're paying so much to their ecosystem
[0:10:28] Sosatko: Yeah pretty crazy
[0:10:34] What_ln_Tarnation: their layoffs is higher than my arena rating

[0:10:40] HoneycombMaven: higher number than I expected for layoffs
[0:10:41] Cephqt: its sort of a small amount considering that you get so much overlap with Mergers and Acquisitions
[0:10:42] WannacryXx: and twitch has nerfed the prime subs
[0:10:49] Spaceberry_McDuck: record profits combined with layoffs. gotta love that combo.
[0:10:57] AtomJar: well im guessing all the survival game devs are a part of that too
[0:10:57] hamsti: Any news what teams were affected?
[0:10:59] zachgamegodx: what was that nerf
[0:11:01] pmakewow: hi ven awc hype awc hype

[0:11:12] Cephqt: M&As always result in layoffs due to overlap
[0:11:24] alan6778: @venruki how dose hpal feel also wsp
[0:11:25] renghost22: public corps unfortunately have a legal obligation to do everything they can to maintain share prices
[0:11:28] Kittensrcute: yeah read the article, crazy that Microsoft's game content and studios president's name is Matt Booty
[0:11:31] zachgamegodx: was it a nerf to ur cut of primes ubs?
[0:11:35] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man

[0:12:58] pmakewow: its healthy if everyone plays it 🤷‍♂️
[0:13:07] LCSpartan: its weird cause its soo mobile compared to everything else even other mage specs
[0:13:08] WannacryXx: 2 much mobility
[0:13:11] GnRHDota2: arcane/ww eeewwww
[0:13:21] pmakewow: the arcane mage community has to attack cdew immediately
[0:13:27] ItsBees: Ranged should have a lot of mobility, it doesn't make sense that melee does
[0:14:06] renae69: arcane mage is fine unless its kubzy, then it needs a nerf
[0:14:07] LCSpartan: @ItsBees those 2 things arent necessarily correlated melee can have lower uptime without ranged having ungodly uptime
[0:15:37] Spaceberry_McDuck: oh hey, that dk is my colombian lover
[0:16:29] ItsBees: Sadge
[0:16:38] Cephqt: @venruki what setting makes Earthen Wall Totem so apparent?

[0:18:14] Cephqt: i cant even see it when a sham drops it in my game
[0:18:40] heymomimonttv: get mes' weakaura pack and it tells you lol
[0:18:54] LCSpartan: @Cephqt the only thing I have seen is  pinging the location of it
[0:18:54] ItsBees: @Cephqt become an artist and get hired at blizzard and change it LUL
[0:19:07] hamsti: RIP they canceled the blizzard survival game
[0:19:09] hamsti: PepeHands
[0:19:11] Cephqt: @ItsBees no i mean its much more obvious on Ven's stream than in game for me
[0:19:26] ooPickleRicKoo: I am so glad I used my prime on this channel
[0:19:33] mayonaes: That rogue is in love with his step kick macro
[0:19:45] What_ln_Tarnation: how was prime nerfed
[0:19:55] EliteDamit: how’s the hpal going? think it might be my next healer to learn
[0:20:05] What_ln_Tarnation: o
[0:20:10] ItsBees: @Cephqt try turning up graphic settings, sometimes it's something small like projected textures/ground clutter
[0:20:13] ezmoney3434: you don’t have an aura up I don’t think my guy lol
[0:21:07] hamsti: gouge is kinda insane
[0:22:57] VetisBR: ya that is crazy. i remember watching @palumor getting so emotional about gifted subs rolling in and turns out it was worthless
[0:23:06] ezmoney3434: It’s my birthday today Ven! Gonna play some wow all night after work! 😎
[0:23:21] darkremorse22: yo ven how you been :)

[0:23:42] hamsti: naw gifted subs are the same across the board its just primes i thought?
[0:23:50] nikthevoker: primes
[0:23:51] WannacryXx: South America
[0:24:02] Luigicamp: is it gifted or primes?
[0:24:03] hamsti: Also realistically people in other countries where they're worth less.... are probably not gifting su bs
[0:24:08] hamsti: i know 100% its primes
[0:24:12] hamsti: i don't think its gifted but idk
[0:24:14] ItsBees: If anyone is curious https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/local-sub-price-countries?language=en_US
[0:24:16] chancywilson: happy bday @ezmoney3434
[0:24:21] heymomimonttv: yea but there's also countries where their dollar is worth cents of our dollar. $2.50 USD per sub in a 3rd world country would make someone a millionaire with 1 good train
[0:24:33] CasShenkt: been 20 years since i heard puddle of mudd
[0:24:35] ezmoney3434: @chancywilson  thank you!

[0:24:52] stalecheetos: definitely feels like the most fun with rdruid
[0:25:40] Luigicamp: Why is Switzerland not even listed? Cause the sub would have been $10? LuL
[0:25:56] LCSpartan: wait so how does that work if their currency is stronger than the USD?
[0:26:03] Smexxin: ven always with the freshest mogs
[0:26:13] CasShenkt: Switzerland is always special, its a regulatory thing
[0:26:13] chancywilson: @heymomimonttv lmao a dollar implies in US currency your statement is very incorreect
[0:26:41] heymomimonttv: @chancywilson multiple countries have dollars, and we're in a canadian stream rn....
[0:26:52] ooPickleRicKoo: my pally has a moustache too lol
[0:26:54] hamsti: lmao what are we even talking about anymore

[0:28:17] chancywilson: Its called CAD
[0:28:17] ALLtheEXP: Ven looks like the kinda guy who wears the freshest mogs, hikes the chillest trails and hangs with the highest rated players
[0:28:21] Cephqt: @heymomimonttv mexican dollar? lol
[0:28:28] chancywilson: when ppl say dollar nobody thinks of Canada lmao
[0:28:37] LCSpartan: @heymomimonttv or Kuwait, and thats not even counting those that translate into the word dollar
[0:28:38] nymeriaqt: nymeriaqt subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 88 months! PartyParrot  rukiParty  howdy

[0:31:09] abusedfetusqt: My fingers smell like cheese
[0:31:10] BlazeStryker: for someone who does not do pvp, how hard is it to get the vicious saddle?

[1:03:42] atrain742: Not "mostly blizzard", but yes blizzard is affected
[1:03:45] DirtyYankee0: can you whisper me that article? Id like to read it @cruelhabbitts
[1:03:49] b_lappy: they probably paid a consulting firm like mckinsey millions of dollars to come in and tell them to lay off said people

[1:08:26] DirtyYankee0: pretty bad sign imo
[1:08:27] Moobot: Latest video "I Tried The Riskiest PvP Talent In Dragonflight" view it here: youtu.be/GBqYTq6J37A
[1:08:29] cruelhabbitts: some people are so weird lol
[1:08:35] xilyx2: thats kinda funny tho tbh
[1:08:36] sourbutts: whats ur opinion on affli, i just finished gearing my lock, im like 1600, just started playing lock
[1:08:37] ryanblue98: sounds like someone needs to lay off twitter for awhile
[1:08:51] xilyx2: pokemon fans out for blood
[1:08:52] pure__goat: its all over the internet
[1:09:06] sourbutts: should i just play destro/demo?
[1:09:07] heymomimonttv: @Magottx i've been pushing arms the last week. it's fun af to play but nowhere near as good as it used to be. pretty comp dependent and doesn't carry lobbies as well as it used to
[1:09:11] DirtyYankee0: we live in the sstrangest times
[1:09:22] Jayzyzz_: pokemon fans mad that the slop they've been consuming for decades can actually be better LUL
[1:09:27] Syloid: i would say evil times not strange

[1:09:51] cruelhabbitts: they would be screwed lol
[1:09:53] kyaxd: they suffer a little
[1:09:56] zachgamegodx: my dad used to say "join the army' when he'd hear aobut ppl complaining about suchsuperficial things..hhe was a military vet
[1:10:01] Badasti: send them collectively to the ranch
[1:10:02] Magottx: @heymomimonttv i could see that. i just had back to back 5-1 at 2100 tho but couldve been lucky lobbies
[1:10:05] Lazeeqt: @venruki have you seen the new blood DK meta from EU?
[1:10:05] dwarf_urfii: @DirtyYankee0 I see, thanks :D
[1:10:06] BCboy_: no ones actually mad about that kind of stuff its just attention bait for retweets leeching
[1:10:10] Ceribi: u mean they wont find something else to be mad about in the wild
[1:10:18] kreyzy8: just a minor near death experience is all
[1:10:31] ryanblue98: most pokemon fans are very chill
[1:10:37] renghost22: rage does generate engagement, so it's farmed on social media unfortunately
[1:10:42] heymomimonttv: @Magottx i've been stuck 1775 for 2 days now with constant 3-3 lobbies. my reflex looks crazy with all the 3-3's lol
[1:10:54] mellophello: New to the stream and heard The Strokes. Ill be here for a while. cheers mate.
[1:11:10] Gehmnal: Is Palworld really any different than when Blizzard developed Warcraft because they were denied licensing to create a Warhammer game, way back in the day?
[1:11:27] Magottx: @heymomimonttv i kind of got stuck there too tbh. focused a lot on tryna save smash/sharpen goes when healer gets a lil micro cc'd by my team
[1:11:29] kreyzy8: Ven always has the old school jams playing
[1:11:53] ryanblue98: is there a way to tell if its your dome or other teams
[1:12:01] aultymalganis: came for the Ven, stayed for the tunes
[1:12:02] willie_stroker_99: Warlock is so fun
[1:12:08] kreyzy8: @ryanblue98 enemy dome is slightly red
[1:12:09] Ernanz: Ele sham is going crazy
[1:12:11] hooqs: blustacks the goat
[1:12:13] Lazeeqt: @ryanblue98 friendly Dome is yellow, enemy dome is orange
[1:13:15] kusoneko: this sham has infinite interrupts lmao
[1:13:18] kreyzy8: I think I see why smex didn't want to heal as disc KEKW
[1:13:24] kreyzy8: he's oom already
[1:13:36] Unemploymentz: that right there is why I stopped playiing lock
[1:13:39] BCboy_: Smexual gamin
[1:13:43] 13thswaglord: @venruki your tyrant just walked at the ele and stood there lmao
[1:13:59] 13thswaglord: didn’t shoot once the poor lost lad
[1:14:13] ryanblue98: Destro

[1:14:26] Ameratzu: warriors life so ez
[1:14:28] Magottx: lol thats my entire WoW life lately
[1:14:32] Asharnix: That is exactly how demo feels when I play it in solo shuff
[1:14:37] ryanblue98: lowering mmr for easy wins now
[1:14:41] Kittensrcute: thats been my wow life since cata since I don't play as much lol
[1:14:41] Lazeeqt: make a new blood DK and have an average of 130k dps all game while u cannot die
[1:14:52] Magottx: like 6 guys at 2k and none higher than 2.4 anymore
[1:15:07] Locturnal_TV: swaxpy was talking about how you actually get worse at the game the more alts you actively play and its better to just focus on 2-3 max
[1:15:14] kreyzy8: oh ya I saw the outlaw rogue he fought yesterday, it was super weird
[1:15:32] Maxlolrogue: 13 raiders from Maxlolrogue have joined! 
[1:15:38] kreyzy8: this guy was doing his full dam rotation and ccing pika while targeting his teammate lol
[1:15:44] BCboy_: @locturnal_tv You really notice it too once you go back to the 2-3
[1:15:54] yowler_: If I can have permission to link I will send
[1:15:56] sum_x: some people are just insane on every class like smexxin
[1:16:00] Badasti: @yowler_ Ven can see it
[1:16:07] Badasti: even if your message got deleted
[1:16:12] sourbutts: i would say purely from the standpoint of game knowledge, play lots of classes and learn their damage rotation and buttons, makes it much easier to play against
[1:16:50] xilyx2: mind trauma is such an annoying talent lol
[1:16:59] kreyzy8: @yowler_ he can see the link it just gets deleted if you're not a sub
[1:17:28] Cephqt: UA backlash needs to get buffed AGAIN after the stam increases to healers
[1:17:44] Lazeeqt: @Cephqt stam to healers was just 5%
[1:17:51] Magottx: god UA is so painful in 90% of lobbies man
[1:17:54] ryanblue98: rip
[1:17:54] blackheart1110: this is the comp I had last night in black rook arena as arcane mage. not sure what to do with double warlock and spriest as mage
[1:18:02] Yaycarrots: monkaLaugh
[1:18:03] yowler_: @kreyzy8 @Badasti oh cool thanks. didnt know
[1:18:06] blackheart1110: in solo shuffle

[1:19:52] kreyzy8: yeah
[1:20:01] dropbombsss: this clip is oof
[1:20:21] xilyx2: fast knock monkahmm
[1:20:24] BCboy_: the funny thing is whaazz still gets the stun on jaime “cheating”
[1:20:25] Locturnal_TV: looks like a knock 123 macro
[1:20:26] dropbombsss: whaz knows instantly
[1:20:35] yungtropikal: not sure if hes tracking enough buffs on his screen or not?
[1:20:38] Magottx: the dragons on his frames throws me off so much lol idk why
[1:20:46] Borngood: ..........

[1:20:53] Pradathelord: the first one could have been a fluke
[1:20:54] SquidSosa: lol
[1:20:57] Pradathelord: but that second one was crazy
[1:20:57] rogerscruton1: who is cheating? joined late
[1:20:57] BCboy_: sus
[1:20:58] Pradathelord: HAHA
[1:21:03] cruelhabbitts: wtf lol
[1:21:03] paradise1_: @Borngood
[1:21:15] carneasada34: the big thing was the kick %, when he played at blizzcon he didnt kick well for shit, but on ladder hes perfect
[1:21:16] Borngood: just lucky timing
[1:21:20] kreyzy8: whaazz used to defend and play with him all the time and now he even says he thinks he's a cheater
[1:21:22] Sosatko: the worst part is the man cheats and still gets farmed in awc like a dog lol
[1:21:23] xilyx2: i mean everyone knows.. its jaime LUL
[1:21:32] tarth_100: lol yikes
[1:21:32] nooblordxd: lucky?  pika was calling it a script last night
[1:21:39] badmy__: but there is no proof of cheats
[1:21:47] nikthevoker: wasnt he on whazz team?
[1:21:48] Lazeeqt: jaime is a known cheater
[1:21:50] nightmxz: I consistenly knocked warrior charge and leap with supernova as arcane, but that's A LOT slower than grapple and I was saving globals for it KEKW
[1:21:51] Locturnal_TV: i dont think thats strong evidence
[1:21:51] DirtyYankee0: speak on it
[1:21:56] nooblordxd: you can't track grappling cd either because it gets reduced so thats also kinda susge
[1:21:56] Borngood: it's during a time where certain programs are taking over
[1:21:58] Borngood: that's all
[1:21:58] Kalakbar: he had some odd kicks
[1:21:59] DeityRevert: say it
[1:21:59] Jihnn: You can't leave us hanging like that BibleThump
[1:22:00] shredder1111: he just downloaded a really good weakaura pack

[1:22:06] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy Lonepath WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[1:22:06] xilyx2: bro theres hours of evidence LUL
[1:22:07] YRNrico69: say it
[1:22:08] Kalakbar: and then made a weird statement which he then deleted
[1:22:09] DirtyYankee0: looks like great evidence
[1:22:10] Pradathelord: the evolution of the client and also what born said
[1:22:13] Sosatko: he had a 99% kick rate Apparantly in the NA tourney with 100+ ping
[1:22:18] BCboy_: Jaime is just the kick god of eu Kappa
[1:22:20] nikthevoker: gotta make money boosting easier
[1:22:24] sourbutts: hes facing the other way, theres no way he could know unless he has a weakaura for it
[1:22:28] Sosatko: xd
[1:22:33] Magottx: It doesnt need to be said lol
[1:22:35] Kittensrcute: just lucky xd
[1:22:45] Locturnal_TV: any multi r1 ele should be able to make those knocks pretty consistently with arena 123 unleash macros, but yea that kick rate is sus
[1:22:50] badmy__: what if jaime is just extremely good and anyone is cluelessly calling him cheater Kappa
[1:22:54] Borngood: I feel like if ur accused of something like that, you prob make an effort to prove otherwise
[1:22:56] shredder1111: ele shaman players are the most honest
[1:22:57] sum_x: its a gray area as long as you're 50% manual play its fine
[1:23:00] Borngood: have they?
[1:23:17] xilyx2: @Borngood hes just that good
[1:23:20] tarth_100: lol no they shouldnt
[1:23:21] Sideshift: yo

[1:23:48] Sideshift: are you loving wow? will u play sod phase 2?
[1:24:01] VetisBR: i feel like on rogue i press step quickly when sham presses knockback. so isnt that same thing?
[1:24:01] rekroyal: I just got hit with 7 cox ads
[1:24:18] DirtyYankee0: Susge
[1:24:19] blackheart1110: Do you agree with cdew tweet regarding to arcane mages spell steal?
[1:24:20] Badasti: is the barber bugged for anyone else? Keeps telling me I need to be in a barber chair

[1:24:29] DirtyYankee0: thats just blatant
[1:24:32] xilyx2: LOL
[1:24:36] skez_live: "checkout" for phase 2 is a little tough for me since it requires leveling 25-40 and I cba
[1:24:38] cruelhabbitts: lmao
[1:24:43] Locturnal_TV: thats a lil sus
[1:24:43] ameloly: miss clicked i guess
[1:24:44] rogerscruton1: hes watching for it though, why is this so much harder than deathing a blind?
[1:24:50] Magottx: "every r1 ele does that"
[1:24:56] Pradathelord: hes watching for the rdruid to come in?
[1:24:56] DeityRevert: sus af
[1:24:56] ebrithil357: what the average human reaction time? 1 sec
[1:25:01] Locturnal_TV: that grapple is easy to do but that ones not as apparent
[1:25:12] Thrator: what do u think mages best comp is that isn't rmx?
[1:25:13] Pradathelord: if you're watching for a LONG hook
[1:25:15] DirtyYankee0: 1sec? Lol we arent great grandparents @ebrithil357
[1:25:18] sum_x: ive never seen a non botting ele do that
[1:25:19] Pradathelord: but he hits the druid mid leap?
[1:25:20] rogerscruton1: that lontar charge was fairly telegraphed
[1:25:25] simstarx: speaking of deathing blind, I deathed whaazz blind in shuffle yesterday
[1:25:33] xilyx2: these arent in a vacuum its all the time.. its the sum total of all of this lol
[1:25:36] kreyzy8: he's targeting the druid
[1:25:37] ebrithil357: @DirtyYankee0 idk what it is thats why i asked lol
[1:25:38] DirtyYankee0: this one is less sus than the other one
[1:25:39] BCboy_: if your perma looking for it, could be legit but still sus
[1:25:41] Pradathelord: this one i guess
[1:25:48] DirtyYankee0: around 150ms @ebrithil357
[1:25:49] rekt1370: iv done that with dk grip disengage its not that bad
[1:25:52] nargonisttv: Anticipating things can go a long way
[1:25:57] Sideshift: sod phase 2 thoughts?
[1:25:57] Pradathelord: on a long grapple its pretty obvious you can see the hook especially if you know hes wanting to move
[1:26:00] DeityRevert: but he catches it at max range everytime apparently
[1:26:05] shredder1111: it's the sheer amount of times it happens though
[1:26:06] dmicrl: jaime is just crazy good
[1:26:12] ebrithil357: @DirtyYankee0 oh lol
[1:26:12] LCSpartan: also ping difference may be why it looks so fucking weird too
[1:26:22] malvarcla: I never liked Jaimee.
[1:26:22] ImJordanHi: Jaime got a lot better recently LUL
[1:26:30] Endoraesh: jaime is a prodigy
[1:26:31] nightmxz: Saving his infinite ele gcds to perfectly knock healers and dps and always lands his kicks is interesting
[1:26:37] DirtyYankee0: true KEKW
[1:26:42] sum_x: hes the flusha of wow
[1:26:46] reczy__: I've seen pika knock charges multiple times like that
[1:26:47] maakkooo: Does Jaime stream?
[1:26:48] nooblordxd: as a 1400 player i can confirm he's cheating
[1:26:51] nargonisttv: The better you are, the more people are going to hate
[1:26:51] Borngood: they could be right both times, technically
[1:26:52] Borngood: btw
[1:26:53] No7AG4IN: cheating how?
[1:26:55] maybethistimepls: who u got winning this year on NA?
[1:27:00] BCboy_: cuz they play with him lol
[1:27:00] nightmxz: @Borngood True
[1:27:03] DirtyYankee0: both can be true at once
[1:27:12] shredder1111: a lot of people suspect he toggles it on and off at times
[1:27:44] Locturnal_TV: how would that bot even be programmed, to just cast knock if in range after certain abilities are used (leap, charge, grapple, etc) not sure im buying it
[1:27:49] brotherzttv: good ole roxy
[1:27:54] Badasti: hot damn its Roxxy
[1:28:01] rekt1370: nah he didn't cheat he had him targeted before he was going to charge
[1:28:03] DirtyYankee0: yes easily
[1:28:05] SquidSosa: wym bruh lol
[1:28:05] Magottx: literally answered your own question
[1:28:07] sum_x: @Locturnal_TV that bot is 100% a thing tho ive witnessed it multiple times in game
[1:28:07] DirtyYankee0: thats an easy af program lmfao
[1:28:11] cruelhabbitts: that’s what bots do lol
[1:28:13] nameyourform: will someone dm the clips please
[1:28:20] DirtyYankee0: you could spend a day and learn how to program that yourself
[1:28:30] atrain742: That's very simple logic. way easier than "cast ring of peace directly on top of darkness"
[1:28:33] YRNrico69: a bot programming to be a bot?? noo
[1:28:44] Sideshift: do u miss classic at all?
[1:28:45] tarth_100: @locturnal_tv unleash knocks from range. Its not a knock that is proximity based to caster like normal thunderstorm knock is.
[1:28:45] xilyx2: JaimieGPT
[1:28:51] willie_stroker_99: What's the point of cheating? You don't enjoy the game
[1:28:56] heymomimonttv: dangggg bloc party! what a banger song
[1:28:57] kreyzy8: @venruki look at this one too https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/FlirtyFairDurianWow-DYkd4j_0NkAVTF7y?filter=clips&range=7d&sort=time
[1:29:06] kreyzy8: watch what Jaime's char does before he knocks LUL
[1:29:06] ryanblue98: What about Cata
[1:29:09] BCboy_: seeing the programming in the league of legends bot vids made me convinced anything is possible to bot
[1:29:09] ezmoney3434: you playing cata?
[1:29:17] kreyzy8: his char does a 180 KEKW
[1:29:19] tarth_100: @locturnal_tv not saying you are wrong, just that with unleash its prolly easier?
[1:29:30] kreyzy8: @venruki look at Jaime's char
[1:29:44] Ceribi: look at jaimes toon
[1:29:45] maybethistimepls: sterge called jaime out way back and no one believed him
[1:29:46] kusoneko: what a little cheater
[1:29:48] Gii_Aretsa: sus
[1:30:10] heymomimonttv: sterge says jaime is cheater, mag says no. everyone says different things, idk jaime so i cant take a side
[1:30:23] heymomimonttv: dude's hopefully just realllllllly good
[1:30:47] Sideshift: you loving wow dragons?
[1:30:49] jfachal: ven the worlds best mage
[1:30:56] Thrator: yoo @venruki what do u feel like mages best comp is outside of rmx? got a mage buddy im tryin to game with but i play warr and unsure wmx is that insane rn
[1:30:58] Badasti: wishful thinking LUL
[1:31:00] FlyFYI: you would have to do that range window perfect everytime lol especially on a charge
[1:31:17] rekt1370: would warrior mage lose to rogue/mage
[1:31:18] Thrator: do u play arcane in that comp?
[1:31:27] Jayzyzz_: @venruki top 3 frost mages of all time in your opinion?
[1:31:45] heymomimonttv: @rekt1370 i think so. rogue has a lot more burst and control
[1:32:01] rekt1370: warrior got some good buttons to beat rogues
[1:32:03] rekt1370: would be hard tho
[1:32:13] nargonisttv: VURTNE! Watch his pvp video "Vurtne 60-66" it's insane
[1:34:40] Thrator: wonder what spec ur supposed to play in war/mage i guess just arcane
[1:34:43] Thrator: fire would probably just die
[1:34:50] rekt1370: yea frost or arcane
[1:34:52] DirtyYankee0: fire is garb
[1:35:10] Thrator: does fire have any good comp besides rmx rly
[1:35:15] itsKaylux: "i wall alalalala" haha
[1:35:36] rekt1370: legit no point in playing fire really LUL
[1:36:02] DirtyYankee0: yeah just dont play fire
[1:36:23] SquidSosa: i hit 2100 on fire mage first week then they nerfed glass cannon now its trash
[1:36:31] SquidSosa: cant do nothin
[1:36:48] invincibledalyeth: hey venruki how are you man?
[1:36:48] Jayzyzz_: @SquidSosa average fire mage reaction when they can't 100-0 somebody in 3 seconds

[1:40:47] Pradathelord: tbh i like the green one
[1:40:59] DirtyYankee0: Probably depends on what class fears you and if they are running extra fear damage preak talents or not @dmicrl
[1:41:08] DirtyYankee0: break
[1:41:19] Jayzyzz_: is it true that supatease doesn't use target macros on rdru? LUL
[1:41:31] Ernanz: he just clicks

[1:55:20] highmoon7: lower HPS, reduce micro CC, increase mana cost
[1:55:25] lowenergyjeb_: whats for lunch?
[1:55:28] heymomimonttv: the current meta is just playing your class perfectly and getting a good cc chain. if not, you play deep into dampening and hope they make a mistake before you
[1:55:29] ihavesmokedcrack: He has right to complain, this isn't wotlk we don't want 40 min arenas
[1:55:29] Jiviex: is it because of the new Stam changes?

[2:24:22] zybexx42: i played against one in 2s was so annoying lol
[2:24:25] rekt1370: nah rogue mage would fk that comp
[2:24:27] SwiisH_Tv: @havenblood layoffs are happening eveywhere Riot just had theirs
[2:24:33] rekt1370: just setup on warrior and healer over and over
[2:24:57] bump1: that didn't look nearly as bad as the prot pally meta
[2:25:02] lucasthebestx: Bring back mop pvp
[2:25:05] SwiisH_Tv: But doesnt matter Murica on verge of a civil war poggers
[2:25:17] robfrmamzn: destro lock + mw monk with pressing life coccoon and dark pact on cooldown KEKL
[2:25:21] zachgamegodx: ya his biggest burst button heals him
[2:25:23] fatiguecs: is dh or warrior a good alt for a rogue player @venruki
[2:25:39] Xeliumimar: bruh i wanna play bdk in arena now lol
[2:25:57] Banwellx: Just wait for the outlaw rogue blood dk rsham meta
[2:26:10] crymorre: banwellx DansGame
[2:26:39] bump1: stop playing mage demo then ven lol
[2:26:46] Nikademous: I'm down to play any of those banwell hmu
[2:26:50] illEvan11_11: its a bad type of meta
[2:27:06] chaps_86: I bet we see a lot of damp in awc
[2:27:07] bump1: LOL dipi purposefully q'd into you
[2:27:10] kreyzy8: this is what happens when everyone complains damage is too high :\
[2:27:12] SharmaJenkins: is this only because of the stamina buffs on trinkets?
[2:27:29] SharmaJenkins: or was there other change
[2:27:33] DeityRevert: healers had huge mana issues before in pve. then they made it so they basically can't go oom so blizz can make very heal intensive fights. all because of pve
[2:27:45] clicket: @kreyzy8 wow is in a weird place where they have to make healing not feel awful, but when healers are good it's all damp games
[2:27:55] SteLawBro: Sounds like a good change. Mayybe now we wont hear that healers arent playing because things die too fast.
[2:28:19] rekt1370: every game at this rating just ends till a healer ooms pretty much
[2:28:30] illEvan11_11: It goes from every class having stupid burst dmg and being able to randomly kill someone, to nobody being able to die at all lol. One extreme to the other
[2:28:32] chaps_86: on a different map
[2:29:16] limit77: it's time to buff mage Blizzard. right now... right now!
[2:29:23] Saitistreamy: @illEvan11_11 I mean the 3 people working on pvp got laid off today
[2:29:40] robfrmamzn: i put lightsabers on my DH and now i wanna go larping
[2:29:40] gypsyeyez: anyone gifting subs? :D lol
[2:29:51] W00dyyx: Haha shadowfury the forest
[2:29:55] SteLawBro: The problem is you cant balance for 2 skill levels so do you balance for the 5% amazing players or the 95% average players? If the 5% are having a bad time so the 95% can have fun theeeen...So be it i guess. 🤷
[2:30:22] rekt1370: should balance off the 5 percent cause they play the game to the limit
[2:30:31] renghost22: @SteLawBro thats why there's almost always a big balance pass after AWC tbh :P
[2:30:40] renghost22: although this time may be different since they just did one
[2:30:50] Saitistreamy: @rekt1370 lol
[2:31:19] rekt1370: why would you balance off the average player they die to air dont press buttons make 100 mistakes
[2:31:22] crymorre: nerf cc, nerf dps trinket bonus, buff healer trinket cd, buff stamina... how could all of those combined result in damp meta? LuvUok
[2:31:30] Saitistreamy: Id rather they balanced the game to where people doing random battlegrounds were considered pvp players
[2:31:38] SteLawBro: @rekt1370 Money
[2:31:41] rekt1370: random bg is not pvp players
[2:31:51] Saitistreamy: @rekt1370 what is it then?
[2:31:56] Saitistreamy: pve?
[2:31:58] Saitistreamy: co-op?
[2:32:01] JimboslimJones: :D
[2:32:04] rekt1370: dont even know man pvers trying pvp
[2:32:16] renghost22: random bgs is special pvp eductation
[2:32:20] rekt1370: why would a pvp player only play random bg
[2:32:25] heymomimonttv: i'm a pvper, i play random bgs sometimes
[2:32:28] heymomimonttv: just out of boredom
[2:32:33] Cerebryx: less stress
[2:32:34] heymomimonttv: or if i got new gear and wanna stomp
[2:32:57] Saitistreamy: if you que 10 Random bgs, you should count for SS and 3s inflation purposes
[2:32:58] Saitistreamy: and RBGs
[2:33:16] gdodmebxu: What
[2:33:18] robfrmamzn: ratJAM
[2:33:25] dropbombsss: they need to ramp damp waaaay faster in 3s
[2:33:39] Movzee: Hey ven on your sham how did you macro together the ping with Earthen wall
[2:33:42] mvpJ_: illidemons op
[2:33:52] Xeliumimar: tough when they prob listening to your comms lol
[2:33:52] hiddensquid13: i rip a random bg for a warm up
[2:33:55] hiddensquid13: get teh fingers cooing
[2:33:56] hiddensquid13: cooking
[2:34:13] Hiraad: @dropbombsss yeah but then healers need to get some big dmg buffs cause they are totally ueless if they cant even fullfill their purpose
[2:34:34] hatedfear: 6a6
[2:34:57] yikezzxd: ..
[2:34:58] crymorre: in this meta my motivation is dampened faster than healing is
[2:35:25] lilsnaixz: hey @venruki is it worth playing retail again? i didnt played it since 2 years im just scared to hit max lvl and just dont know what to do
[2:35:30] nutz_hang_uneven: sounds fun
[2:35:32] hemm__: same every game was like that
[2:35:35] hemm__: so sweaty
[2:35:39] nutz_hang_uneven: I want 30 minute matches back
[2:35:46] unc0de: @lilsnaixz its pretty linear honestly, youll be fine
[2:35:48] Dwilk20: Venruki even Absterge and them did RPS as outlaw rogue
[2:35:52] Badasti: bro I dont think anyone playing some flavour of zugzug cleave has any right to complain about mage lock
[2:36:08] crymorre: Comps that die in 2 mins when being aggro backfires LUL
[2:36:24] Hiraad: @Badasti so nobody atm
[2:36:29] willie_stroker_99: Good sub with mage and resto druid
[2:36:32] nipnipzz: Thug/rmp or maybe lock/sub
[2:36:33] lilsnaixz: @unc0de best pvp classes atm ?
[2:36:33] nutz_hang_uneven: make every class more tanky
[2:36:34] chancywilson: Can i ask a longish question about mmr/ss?
[2:36:49] nutz_hang_uneven: so I can see 30 minute matches again like bfa season 4
[2:37:04] clicket: What's the ideal? You just be able to kill through healing? Doesn't seem fun for the healer either. Idk what the answer is
[2:37:04] hemm__: outlaw definitely didnt make games faster
[2:37:15] Xeliumimar: in conclusion, you guys need a blood DK on your team
[2:37:20] unc0de: @lilsnaixz rogue, dh, healer druid, boomie
[2:37:32] ATHLTE: revert the stam change
[2:37:44] crymorre: Healer fun should be when they get to contribute damage/cc/make plays
[2:37:48] Xeliumimar: LUL
[2:37:48] crymorre: Not being inmortal
[2:38:05] gachimati: yes
[2:38:08] blkylol: blood dk monkaW
[2:38:13] nutz_hang_uneven: healers stopped being fun when all you had to do was heal and react to cd's
[2:38:17] gachimati: but any time healers do more dmg than nothing everyone cries
[2:38:23] Cerebryx: being a healer this xpac hasn't been fun for me, just stressful af
[2:38:28] Badasti: i just dont know how melee players enjoy the game in comps like this
[2:38:32] Badasti: most boring shit ever
[2:38:38] clicket: @Badasti people like winning
[2:38:39] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:38:43] chaps_86: yea healing hasnt been fun since bfa
[2:38:49] Hiraad: i want to kill pveing my target nerf healers BabyRage
[2:38:52] Badasti: @clicket id rather play something fun thx
[2:38:54] Shaytimes: @chaps_86 couldn't agree more
[2:39:01] chaps_86: i have more fun in 2s as a healer. more time to make plays
[2:39:01] McLarge: Hello Ven. I saw your video about Deathwish LUL
[2:39:03] nipnipzz: Healing is fun when your dps arent apes
[2:39:12] nipnipzz: Thats the only time its fun
[2:39:15] nutz_hang_uneven: to be a healer all you need is a healing rotation bot now
[2:39:48] nutz_hang_uneven: go back to cc and dmg on healers and game is a 100x more fun for everyone
[2:39:56] nutz_hang_uneven: games dont need to be 30 min long
[2:40:11] kreyzy8: if you say it, it will be true COPIUM
[2:40:16] gachimati: yes all of us healers want that
[2:40:29] gachimati: but apes keep crying that there is too much cc in game
[2:40:55] crymorre: I think they should just make 3v3 into a new pve mode against ai personally
[2:40:56] Hiraad: not cc but all that off dr bs like coils or certain roots
[2:41:09] gachimati: just prune dps if any
[2:41:16] gachimati: healers should have cc
[2:41:20] gachimati: like song back on monk
[2:41:41] nutz_hang_uneven: yeah castable cc that has a long affect
[2:41:48] gdodmebxu: I'm glad you all don't balance the game KEKW
[2:41:52] nutz_hang_uneven: instant cc ruins the game
[2:42:07] renghost22: just waited 20 mins for a solo shuffle lobby on my alt DH, got prot pally healers and the longest round lasted 1 min 13s :(
[2:42:27] healmeshammy: big they full hp
[2:42:29] healmeshammy: lmao
[2:42:34] gachimati: @gdodmebxu cant imagine doing worse job than blizzard
[2:42:40] Hiraad: they gotta remove random proc dmg aswell to balance the game for pvp
[2:43:34] nutz_hang_uneven: why balance for a dead game mode
[2:43:48] nutz_hang_uneven: balance the mode people actually play
[2:43:53] malvarcla: they should just make all damage completely random
[2:44:10] crymorre: UltraDamp
[2:44:18] kreyzy8: phase 2 begins Pog
[2:44:32] nutz_hang_uneven: they should give everyone a form the evolve into and when you hit that form you insta kill everyone in the arena
[2:44:48] kreyzy8: phase 3 begins when the pres goes below 80% mana
[2:45:03] clicket: @kreyzy8 (impossible)
[2:45:09] malvarcla: they should just give every single class every single ability in the game. boom balanced.
[2:45:30] Washedupspoon: design ur own class each starting room :)
[2:45:33] Washedupspoon: would be fun!!
[2:45:41] nutz_hang_uneven: "I have dam"  nobody is close to even dying
[2:46:06] chaps_86: holy shit i went to get coffee and you're still in the same game
[2:46:30] nutz_hang_uneven: what happened to the game i Loved SMOrc
[2:46:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blood DK can slow down a match
[2:46:45] gdodmebxu: They made healers broken
[2:47:24] 88prinz88: @venruki bro can u do a new pvp tier list pls?
[2:47:45] nutz_hang_uneven: sick they made tanks do dmg
[2:47:53] nutz_hang_uneven: even better
[2:47:56] awakenxo: hi ven hope youre doing well. much love to you <3
[2:47:58] Xeliumimar: they just listening to your comms, evoker pre walled at 100% hp before you even hit him
[2:47:59] Dwilk20: What was the Warriors healing break down?
[2:48:03] kreyzy8: oh wow they went up 100 mmr :)
[2:48:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: If a tank is meta, Odin help us all LUL
[2:48:05] chancywilson: On my 2300 hpal, ill get ques with a 670 CR healer, granted his Alt is 2500 cr SS and hes multi glad. So its account wide? but im 82-64 decent win rate on my MW but im 1840 CR.. why dont i jump the line? ive had 4 games in row with 0-6 dps, last game there was a 0 cr Holy P in 1900 mmr lobby, he cut the line? again he has 3k SS xp but its fresh alt. Makes no sense to me. Im genuinely curious how this works.
[2:48:08] taylorperiod: I can’t believe this is real
[2:48:14] engzyng: why are blood dks strong now ?
[2:48:17] bollskis: u ugys r the goat tho
[2:48:17] gjvl: You actually did like 12 mil more damage than him he just did a ton of pet dam
[2:48:34] gdodmebxu: This caster meta is crazy Kappa Kappa
[2:48:37] nutz_hang_uneven: @gjvl crazy auto dmg is a thing
[2:48:53] Hiraad: destro arcane is actually very fun
[2:49:01] Pradathelord: i go grab lucnh and i see a blood dk on meter
[2:49:03] hotshotss11: Did you watch Supatease's latest video?
[2:49:04] Pradathelord: i am going to puke i think
[2:49:12] Syloid: the game just gets worse and worse over the time being kinda sad
[2:49:27] gjvl: @nutz_hang_uneven I'm unsure what you mean
[2:49:33] drewlivelyy: yeah just go next
[2:49:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: The Blood DK 4-set is very good, and they did get buffed a number of times this expansion, but I don't know
[2:49:57] VetisBR: BLIZZARD GET RID OF TANKS IN ARENA
[2:50:07] Zaiyge: can you show pres healing real quick?
[2:50:09] Zaiyge: last game
[2:50:14] hataroxz: blood dk good against caster cleave
[2:50:14] nutz_hang_uneven: no way a class that takes less dmg should do that much dmg
[2:50:18] nutz_hang_uneven: ever
[2:50:21] gdodmebxu: I'm just glad we're in a caster meta
[2:50:26] leeka: awe i just got here, did i miss out on some good gameplay
[2:50:35] Pradathelord: @leeka yeah, tanks WOOT
[2:50:41] McLarge: Blizzard really should just exclude tanks from Arenas. They have their place as Flag carriers in BGs and PvE.
[2:50:45] leeka: @Pradathelord i love tanks in pvp!
[2:50:49] Pradathelord: same
[2:51:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: If Blood is in the mix, we need Brewmaster!
[2:51:16] Pradathelord: @wEiRdO_dUdE NO
[2:51:20] chancywilson: i play double blood dk twos its so fun i got my first 1800 this szn!
[2:51:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vengeance might actually work, I bet
[2:51:49] Pradathelord: it does
[2:51:54] Pradathelord: but dont play tanks
[2:52:43] Seprin: oh boy
[2:52:45] kreyzy8: KEKW
[2:52:49] Seprin: LUL
[2:52:51] gdodmebxu: Caster meta Pog
[2:52:57] Dwilk20: Venruki you should play Outlaw rogue
[2:53:00] Cephqt: BM hunters shrug
[2:53:03] Cephqt: zoo is back
[2:53:08] troniixlol: caster meta says who? looks like DK is still annoying af and pumps
[2:53:21] Blitzylive: dk too
[2:53:26] nameyourform: if u dont have a rogue, ur trolling.
[2:53:27] nameyourform: lmfao
[2:53:27] Blitzylive: gotta have melee if you want to win
[2:53:34] Seprin: and lost to Supa at the end LUL
[2:53:34] Yaycarrots: HmmMeeting
[2:53:55] Zanketsuk3n: invite smexxin
[2:53:57] hiddensquid13: want me to hop on my warrior? i'm ass
[2:54:09] brotherzttv: just play RMP to glad?
[2:54:10] Seprin: he was just saying how arcane and outlaw are super broke
[2:54:13] Metaphors: HE KNOWS
[2:54:15] Metaphors: FOR CERTAIN
[2:54:29] gjvl: sadge
[2:54:46] gjvl: they try to buff casters and they just take away their only win condition because you cant burst down any melee DPS anymore
[2:55:12] Dourme: whys lfg seem dead this week? shouldnt uncapped cq mean everyones queueing?
[2:55:15] ScottiexPip: whos the blood dk
[2:55:17] Delxenyo: @gjvl aff spriest meta
[2:55:33] Pradathelord: i would love to see the stam buff removed
[2:55:38] Blitzylive: sometimes you win and sometimes you get got per asmond
[2:55:40] Cerebryx: and sometimes you get slugged by a blood dk
[2:55:44] Pradathelord: especially after we are about to have some of the dampest AWC gameplay
[2:55:53] gjvl: OH ILL COMPLAIN IF I DAMN WELL PLEASE MR RUKI
[2:55:53] nameyourform: lets some holy
[2:55:58] nameyourform: lets see some holy
[2:56:03] Dwilk20: Venruki lets be really game is only balanced when Arms warriors out heal Spriest
[2:56:06] Metaphors: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
[2:56:20] W00dyyx: Some holy priest will cheer you up
[2:56:29] Badasti: hell yeah brother bring on that frost mage
[2:56:31] Zanketsuk3n: the game is best when warriors stand supreme, facts
[2:56:34] Blitzylive: is hpriest op now?
[2:56:37] Hiraad: holy priest is gigastrong
[2:56:39] hulkdieselx: solo shuffle caused this imo. the ladder is drained. only ppl playing it are sweating on their keyboard playing ultra meta comps for the 20th glad win in a row
[2:56:43] Roxxybolts: sorry buddy we tried
[2:56:47] SquidSosa: 2ez
[2:56:59] clicket: garbanzo shuttled in to the shuffle victory
[2:56:59] Badasti: i thought that was my queue pop, i was so confused when i couldnt see the enter arena button
[2:57:01] clicket: EZ
[2:57:02] Saitistreamy: SS playrate is 10x 3s
[2:57:07] Zanketsuk3n: i think the problem with retail is that they give us what we want, but not what we need
[2:57:08] Saitistreamy: it didnt help it
[2:57:21] hulkdieselx: solo shuffle is bad for ladder. whether you like shuffle or ladder better is a different question imo
[2:57:22] Dourme: Id like to know how many people that play SS would queue up in lfg if SS didn't exist...
[2:57:27] chaps_86: maybe it's more fun to most people?
[2:57:35] nipnipzz: There is not one single healer in game that enjoys solo shuffle
[2:57:48] lancemanly_426: Check out this remake by wiz khalifa
[2:57:48] Zanketsuk3n: solo shuff is good for ladder because otherwise they wouldn't pvp
[2:57:50] Thrells: @hulkdieselx People wanted something more sophisticated than SS
[2:58:02] morrs: I've been waiting whole day to see the Honorable Garbanzo in action :D
[2:58:08] SquidSosa: right like the people who only play solo shuf prob never played 3s to begin with
[2:58:13] Juarrior: i want to get back to wow so bad but everyone talkin so bad about pvp
[2:58:13] MagickWarlock: if you say solo is bad for ladder you're insane, if it wasnt for solo id probably quit the game
[2:58:17] Lillania: Living the dream just got 2 instant shuffle pops as deeps!
[2:58:21] Saitistreamy: but LFG group posting amount is like, what alliance 3v3 lfg was in shadowlands before it was 2 factions
[2:58:23] hiddensquid13: yeah most people don't have 3s teams
[2:58:26] Alyxsandr: I wouldnt play 3's
[2:58:27] lilskeets: "SOD is killing retail" same mentality which just isn't true
[2:58:27] baxter5569: like me!
[2:58:29] baxter5569: i hate 3s
[2:58:29] hiddensquid13: 100% nailed it
[2:58:30] Alyxsandr: 2's only and shuffle so yeah
[2:58:31] b_lappy: truth
[2:58:32] Zanketsuk3n: there needs to be more pvp gamemodes that are actually fun
[2:58:32] yakobray: you q ss then when ur friends are on u go 3s so i think ss is good#
[2:58:33] malvarcla: I wouldnt
[2:58:35] Wondernoobx: I definitely stopped playing 3s when shuffle was added
[2:58:38] Dwilk20: I wouldnt be on the game right now if I couldnt Q solo shuffle
[2:58:39] Hiraad: I didnt even enter ss for the whole season
[2:58:39] nipnipzz: Heres the thing
[2:58:40] chaps_86: @lilskeets good analogy
[2:58:41] Seprin: yeah a lot wont. solo was for those who liked 3's but no friends stuck with the game
[2:58:42] Dwilk20: would be nothing to do
[2:58:43] MalafisTV: Yeah I probably wouldn't have started playing arena if it weren't for solo shuffle
[2:58:43] smitesucks: alot of people can't even get into 3s if they didnt have solo shuff to practice in if they are a new player
[2:58:46] cruelhabbitts: I think shuffle was great for the game
[2:58:49] clicket: A lot of people wouldn't play, but a lot of people would also go back to chain qing 3s like streamers did before shuffle right?
[2:58:50] Dourme: Ok delete 3s so they have to play SS and add glad mount to it
[2:58:51] cmf_westers: I honestly dont think I know anyone that would pass up a 3's session to queue shuffle instead
[2:58:52] drewlivelyy: @MalafisTV same here
[2:58:53] Saitistreamy: if SOD is killing retail, retail deserves to die lol
[2:58:54] Delxenyo: Crypto is killing retail
[2:58:54] Outer_Limitz: yeah I unironically don’t have friends to play arena with lol
[2:58:56] cruelhabbitts: I wouldn’t play without shuffle
[2:58:56] MagickWarlock: solo is the best thing to happen to pvp
[2:58:57] cmf_westers: you play shuffle when there's no 3's
[2:58:57] Seprin: microsoft just killed the game LUL
[2:59:00] hulkdieselx: SOD killer WOTLK, not retail lol
[2:59:00] kjjuu: my beef with solo shuffle is the match making
[2:59:03] hulkdieselx: killed*
[2:59:04] morrs: I like solo shuffle. I am studying all the classes to prepare to go ham in solo shuff :D
[2:59:08] Birming: 3s is def more dead now than it's ever been
[2:59:08] nipnipzz: How many people in solo shuffle really are above 1800 and would play regular 3s
[2:59:15] primejusticegaming: idk, prior to SS i tried to do RBGS or 3s arena every season. Now im less inclined to do 3s cause SS exists and i can do it in my own time rather than having to schedule time with a team to do it
[2:59:19] nipnipzz: A very low %
[2:59:23] Sosatko: even I’m pretty SOD’d out atm
[2:59:34] lancemanly_426: Check out this remake by wiz khalifa
[2:59:40] nipnipzz: Solo q isnt something good players play all the time
[2:59:51] MalafisTV: Solo shuffle is like a gateway drug to arena. You get a taste of it and then you want to master it. Now I'm cool with learning and working on 2's and 3's
[2:59:52] Juarrior: there r long ques even at like 1600 cr?

[3:00:00] Delxenyo: Retail solo shuffle will outlive any classic version I've said it there it is
[3:00:07] lancemanly_426: the thrill- wiz khalifa.
[3:00:23] hulkdieselx: i had a group of 4-5 ppl who played 3s together all the time. now they all just sit in discord and play and complain about SS in the same channel as each other lol
[3:00:23] nipnipzz: Solo shuffle is for the fps players that come over to mmo
[3:00:27] morrs: Dude I don't want to remember the sad times where I had to search for friends to play. I definitely like solo shuff
[3:00:27] Delxenyo: Solo shuffle kinda gives the high pvp premades a taste how it feels to play with mortals
[3:00:31] nipnipzz: Or lol players
[3:00:34] xjfryx: what is best mage spec for solo rn?
[3:00:52] NazPVP: tha game is so ass
[3:00:56] NazPVP: blizz is lost
[3:01:00] Zanketsuk3n: @Juarrior because the balancing system is trying to find people at 1600 and similar mmr. not match poeople with drastically different skill levels
[3:01:11] chaps_86: @Juarrior usually around 10-15mins. 50% of the playerbase (apparently) is at or below 1600cr.
[3:01:13] kashimofr: yoyoyo
[3:01:20] Sosatko: yeah it’s called a rogue or cyclone xd
[3:01:21] nipnipzz: The last 2 season have had all time low participation
[3:01:22] SquidSosa: i mean thats the nature of comp games no why use something thats worse when you have a easier solution
[3:01:24] Thrells: It feels p balanced. As if most classes and specs can participate and compete
[3:01:29] Juarrior: @Juarrior 15 mins? damn... i see
[3:01:40] Juarrior: @Zanketsuk3n i see
[3:01:42] hulkdieselx: the game is slower now?
[3:01:47] hulkdieselx: slower than when?
[3:01:52] Hiraad: didnt look like that against the dk/bm hunter right now
[3:01:54] chaps_86: @hulkdieselx last week
[3:01:58] hulkdieselx: ahh the hp buff ic
[3:02:01] Badasti: at my rating the game isn't that slow.... but i just dont like melee mobility in the current game
[3:02:04] newnameidk: healers going oom + not killing things in cc chains feels bad
[3:02:06] lancemanly_426: solo is awesome but like the great reckful said. solo is just tossing you people. you aren’t having to find and actually meet people. create that bond.
[3:02:07] morrs: if the game is slower you end up facing immortal Warriors and DKs ..
[3:02:10] zagabombs: game = slower. BLue bar = win con = healing balance and output matters ( its non existent)
[3:02:21] xjfryx: so im new to pvp retail, tried rogue, not as good as everyone else. what is best beginner mage spec to try??
[3:02:22] Badasti: id like to actually have to cast
[3:02:25] gdodmebxu: @newnameidk if healers didn't oom the game would never end
[3:02:27] Thrells: Is Roblox killing wow?
[3:02:40] CasShenkt: Dark age of camelot is the wow killer
[3:02:42] primejusticegaming: Palworld is
[3:02:45] nutz_hang_uneven: @xjfryx try another game
[3:02:48] Zanketsuk3n: @venruki I agree if the game reduces the amount of win conditions, the comps that have the most win conditions become meta. I don't think it's a slow or fast thing.
[3:02:55] Sosatko: nah Druid can heal forever
[3:03:09] Sosatko: plus cyclone woulda farmed them

[3:03:35] nutz_hang_uneven: @lancemanly_426 gaming in general is different now
[3:03:44] joyrex_j9: rdruids make the game garbo
[3:03:50] Hiraad: druid is good with castercleaves but terrible in meele cleave mirror compared to pala
[3:03:54] blkylol: rdruid is so ResidentSleeper
[3:03:58] chaps_86: @joyrex_j9 but they're so fun =D
[3:03:58] olcsy_: i mean, you playing pvp for what? chasing a number which boost your ingame ego now, actually you got zero reward for pvp, in old times you get to a higher rating so you could get the best gear
[3:04:02] Sosatko: @joyrex_j9 ppl say that about any healer when it’s meta lol
[3:04:03] Zanketsuk3n: druid tsg is insane tho
[3:04:12] drewlivelyy: @olcsy_ its to have fun
[3:04:16] lancemanly_426: @nutz_hang_uneven not for the better unfortunately
[3:04:22] drewlivelyy: i think most people who play pvp generally have fun
[3:04:30] malvarcla: no
[3:04:41] Badasti: @olcsy_ getting rating isnt just about your ego, its about accomplishment and improvement
[3:04:41] Yaycarrots: fun DansGame
[3:04:47] olcsy_: pvp fun?
[3:04:47] robfrmamzn: to look good
[3:04:56] healhut: "what's the point of playing highschool basketball"

[3:05:23] lancemanly_426: “why wipe my ass I’m just gonna shit again”
[3:05:25] primejusticegaming: Whats the point of breathing, you only breath to inflate your lungs.
[3:05:30] Lazarinth: I simply have fun in arena, 3v3/ss/2v2 which ever
[3:05:45] Saturnswow: what did you craft on dh
[3:05:50] Thrells: @primejusticegaming idk man, if you dont breathe you die and human instinct is to survive
[3:05:55] b_lappy: blizz devs/blue posts always mention "we've been monitoring player feedback closely" and then they never nerf the things that need to be nerfed even though the entire pvp community complains about the same things being overtuned
[3:05:57] rhokie_hunt: todays society loves to put down a winners mindset or people wanting to better themselves for some reason.
[3:06:04] Neurotoxal: any advice for a depressed feral solo shuffle main?
[3:06:05] brownandnerdy: palworld
[3:06:06] primejusticegaming: they fired like 1900 employees
[3:06:07] SquidSosa: they also laid off like 2k emplyees
[3:06:08] Cerebryx: market too saturated probably
[3:06:08] Elviiy: cos it was baaaad
[3:06:10] Thrells: @B_Lappy "surgical changes"
[3:06:20] drewlivelyy: blizz survival game must have had some bad feedback
[3:06:30] Elviiy: phil didnt like it

[3:16:18] Aquatixlol: @venruki What's the build? I just popped in.
[3:16:31] McLarge: Inner Demon feels good into cleaves, but not really better than the A Fire Inside build. And into stuff that controls you and kites, Inner Demon feels garbage. That's just my exp though
[3:16:44] malvarcla: dh is up there with the hardest classes just like BM, especially if you cant count to 3
[3:17:10] blkylol: priest used everything already lol
[3:17:16] Tamales888: i started playing DH this week and i keep getting told im the worst DH to have ever existed in all my shuffles  🥲

[3:18:43] smitesucks: @Tamales888 dude when i que alts around 2k mmr ill get both first time 2kers and previous rank 1 players talking trash its some kind of mental illness just ignore them

[3:23:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Trill on DH is cool to watch
[3:23:50] McLarge: Sigil of Flame generates 30 Fury, but if you play the talent that causes your Sigils to generate a Soul Fragment then you can use it to get 50 Fury
[3:23:51] Blitzylive: so basically winning means happy
[3:23:58] Blitzylive: loosing means sad

[3:44:22] chaps_86: @jayyArrington spam 2s to learn dr's, cc chains, dmg rotation, etc.
[3:44:25] JimboslimJones: Any specific reason you're saving that tier piece mark you have in bag Vem? @venruki
[3:44:27] Axtin: windwalker life
[3:44:36] wreklol: it's not that FW is hated at the top end i think. i think it actually stems from the 1600-1800 bracket of shuffle where they find melee mains that want faster queues and play FW. those folks don't actually do healing things like dispelling or using buttons proactively to keep the team up and aggressive. just my take from what i hear

[4:41:18] papaript: It is, but it isn't. Lets be honest - more American kids want to be gamers and streamers than doctors or lawyers
[4:41:26] kalibus1: I'm saying it has no bearing on whether a merged company reduces its head count
[4:41:32] kaounallah: I work in M&A and this is very typical. They need to lay off people to maintain segment profitability because a lot of functions are duplicated and MSFT can use their own intern resources
[4:41:33] kalibus1: It happens when companies get  bought
[4:41:39] ItsJhelo: Its simple, Blizz is 100% about profit. Q4 profit reflected a need for change. They put the money where they felt it would be most effective and the Survival game wasnt it
[4:41:52] nightmxz: @kalibus1 riot layoffs too this past week so idk about that

[4:53:00] betasoldier: For police and firefighters it mostly depends on where you are at.
[4:53:03] Kymagez: look at police
[4:53:06] conman_91: @cnuttington sorry brother. good luck and hugs to you
[4:53:07] AmericanHeartAssociation: @heymomimonttv we work with them though and we also work in canada too 😭

[4:53:39] therottenfo: well see, in terms of the social media world. 80k is devastatingly low.
[4:53:46] Badasti: i totally think firefighters and police deserve more money than computer programmers, but the truth is companies are competing for the best programmers, nto the best firefighters
[4:53:47] poserdan: firefighters also work like 2 weeks on 1 week off
[4:53:53] Warkwee: its 80k but a n amazing pension
[4:54:05] Kymagez: say that next wildfire
[4:54:05] heymomimonttv: @AmericanHeartAssociation aw thats too bad :( which heart association is ur nemesis? lets set up a cage match
[4:54:08] rekt1370: just crazy all these important jobs make nothing compared to content creators
[4:54:11] Xeliumimar: ppl acting like 80k iss nothing lol
[4:54:14] lundbergmackan: @venruki would you say  3k a month is good or bad salary?
[4:54:16] e10100111001: police and firefighters don't require STEM degrees

[4:54:56] Badasti: if i could make 7 figures doing onlyfans I'd be flapping my balls away right now
[4:54:59] poserdan: @zachgamegodx average is misleading, look for median
[4:55:03] buffrogues: Atlantic City cops get like 85k a year. Then work in the casinos make 95 dollars an hour they make great money
[4:55:04] zachgamegodx: it was kappa brother
[4:55:09] rekt1370: i mean wow is not the best streaming game lol

[4:56:46] SwiisH_Tv: i used to love wathcing Mr beast donate to no viewer streamers

[4:57:08] buffrogues: that is way twitch is losing money a lot of ppl just stream to stream
[4:57:21] piggiepie: hey look this are the rich guys... 5 viewers :)
[4:57:22] lilskeets: to be fair everyone streaming isn't a content creator.  Sometimes I stream to record gameplay.  that being said 98% of people on twitch arn't making enough to live on
[4:57:23] therealdemps: @AmericanHeartAssociation plz god make cpr recertifications every 4 years
[4:57:34] heymomimonttv: @therottenfo thats not the case in my town whatsoever
[4:57:35] DoYouWannaHug: @therealdemps For real
[4:57:35] bollskis: my buddy is a veteran cop and he makes 6 figures
[4:57:37] Kymagez: they also have OF tho dw
[4:57:43] AmericanHeartAssociation: @therealdemps you are talking with the wrong department for that change LOL
[4:57:46] Xeliumimar: point proven
[4:57:53] GaryTTV: If everyone just agreed to watch me, I'd have so many viewers
[4:57:56] poserdan: A lot of people need to realize about Content Creators is you have to dedicate much more of your life than a regular 9-5 job would demand of you, and even then you have to get extremely lucky to start making a livable earning
[4:58:02] Badasti: you'll be scrolling all night
[4:58:02] therealdemps: cant hurt to try @AmericanHeartAssociation  <3
[4:58:07] Mhortai: @GaryTTV rukiGrin
[4:58:08] foxyllama: i think u gotta be like 400+

[4:58:21] zalazar___: 1000
[4:58:22] therottenfo: at least fucking 500.
[4:58:22] jherrera154: You need over 1k to be sustainable.
[4:58:24] renghost22: 2-3k to make a living imo
[4:58:24] rekt1370: really depends one person can make you a living

[4:58:56] Kymagez: what do you call a fulltime income?
[4:58:59] lilskeets: and people wonder why rank 1's sell boosts
[4:59:14] Nikademous: Na national average is like 24k a year
[4:59:16] gjvl: female streamers need 50 viewers to make a living, male streamers need 5-600
[4:59:18] SwiisH_Tv: ah, because swifty said he makes more now from 24/7 streaming with ads than when he streamed wow fulltime
[4:59:19] piggiepie: @venruki For $1k/mo how many viewers do I need?
[4:59:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: A 50 viewer streamer can do a lot of bag streams
[4:59:24] Kymagez: id say more
[4:59:28] Kymagez: is needed
[4:59:33] e10100111001: sell feet pics
[4:59:33] strafekey: I couldn’t live off minimum honestly

[4:59:44] AmericanHeartAssociation: we're dipping out but have a great rest of stream!
[4:59:45] zachgamegodx: i think 500 viewers at most times to make minimum wage if u dont have an insane gifter pool like mes or pika
[4:59:49] Badasti: I actually have a lot of respect for you Ven, not onyl for not selling out for classic or other popular games, but also for actually accepting multiple opinions in your stream and not banning anyone that doesnt agree
[4:59:50] rekt1370: sure the just chatting girls wiht 50 viewers making money LUL
[4:59:58] olashma: perato distribution
[5:00:07] Kymagez: yes but they make it worse
[5:00:09] gjvl: @foxyllama get a boobjob and do bearded lady hot tub streams

[5:00:18] foxyllama: bro i got a chest alrdy
[5:00:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it's like that 70/30 split....it's like 1% of streamers can get that
[5:00:25] Luigicamp: at the end of the day, if someone believes is that ez to make money streaming, go ahead, try it. :)
[5:00:30] ZealotryTV: @Badasti thats the canadian in him Kappa
[5:00:39] gjvl: @foxyllama then shave it and put a bikini on or low T
[5:00:44] modsbruto: this song is awesome !

[5:00:50] jherrera154: @Luigicamp Based and true
[5:01:00] Yoseirl: the only money i ever made streaming was my brother donating xD sure felt good tho
[5:01:04] strafekey: I think as long as your diverse with twitch/youtube/sponsors and make a honest income your doing awesome
[5:01:08] ZealotryTV: @stupidusedidiot why not
[5:01:12] indrah___: Q's are a nightmare
[5:01:21] Xeliumimar: wants and needs
[5:01:31] SwiisH_Tv: to become successful streaming i feel like you need a clip or short or something to go viral
[5:01:33] Kymagez: wtf can you need 100k a month for?
[5:01:34] DoYouWannaHug: Just put TTV in your name and rage quit all shuffles so everyone comes and flames you

[5:03:30] therottenfo: i think my favorite part of ven's steaming is the entire TBC expansion playing with snutz and swaping rogue mage. good times.
[5:03:45] logikol: play some shadow priest
[5:03:47] ZealotryTV: its not a matter of need vs want. if you are providing something people pay 100k/month then its irrelevant if the person earning it needs it or not
[5:04:00] rekt1370: spec bans only for dps
[5:04:01] mynameistwavis: wow

[6:07:15] pragma90: hope dps watch this and realize how shit it is to be a healer in shuffle

[6:10:45] NurseBenji: Absolutely goated song
[6:11:06] Kymagez: @xilyx2 yeah im not that clever
[6:11:15] ch4osp4nda: How does tie = loss?

[6:12:13] What_ln_Tarnation: 6:0 DH inc
[6:12:14] jdsauza: you peaked at like 240k hps
[6:12:16] nameyourform: dh diff
[6:12:56] What_ln_Tarnation: disc doesnt have high HPS cuz they have DR to compensate
[6:13:03] What_ln_Tarnation: LUL
[6:13:11] Yaycarrots: 🥚
[6:13:11] skepperr: REAL CREED HOURS
[6:13:15] ch4osp4nda: Thats stupid, that in a tied game you still lose if your opponent is lower mmr...
[6:13:25] chaosemperor77: the system is booty
[6:13:25] addyz0r: shouldnt you get the same?
[6:13:31] What_ln_Tarnation: i honestly cant believe blizz hasnt fixed this healer issue
[6:13:35] addyz0r: healer vs healer in a draw
[6:13:40] sked420: yeah it sucks big time matching someone lower
[6:14:01] fistweaveurnan: After a 4-2 game under zero circumstance should you have been penalized again.
[6:14:33] What_ln_Tarnation: id say "blizz fix your game" but dunno if there's anyone left still working there
[6:15:25] itsaustinnx: so ven , Ive pushed 2.2 on 3 classes as dps in shuffle this season. i made a sham and even going 57-45 im stuck in the high 1500s for rating and noticing when u 4-2 5-1 im getting very little points and mmr . is that normal for healing in shuffs ?
[6:15:27] stealthwalker99: Add all the mmr differences up and see if it's par. For me it's par till I get very high up then gets negative
[6:15:29] joyrex_j9: it's your duty, as a battle mender
[6:15:37] Snypes_SYCO: What if they just got rid of MMR and used the them teams Cr as average?
[6:15:38] What_ln_Tarnation: bill gates plays a enh sham, he paid $70b to kill wow cuz his class is always bottom
[6:16:00] What_ln_Tarnation: KEKW
[6:16:04] Chipslol: lol
[6:16:13] exercisefreak: Thoughts on the changes so far? Like how dh and sub is untouched
[6:16:14] stealthwalker99: example you were 50 higher so -50 if you are 50 mmr higher +50 to see if you're actually getting shafted overall
[6:16:24] morrs: highly improbable
[6:16:38] SteLawBro: Ive never seen Bigdam and bill gates in the same place  ya know... 🤔
[6:16:41] stealthwalker99: from the reflex data
[6:17:03] stealthwalker99: you see the other heals that's all that matters
[6:17:07] Badasti: nuu
[6:17:09] nightmxz: see ya :)
[6:17:09] korbendallas2625: wait what is this addons ?
[6:17:14] morrs: @havenblood I think whatever happens will be way better than what we had since Bobby is kicked
[6:17:18] NurseBenji: Great stream brother
