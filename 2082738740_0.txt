Well, this is a serious enterprise and a reputable business and you are harming the interests of my company by denying Pyramids™.

This awful game is why Twitch isn’t fun, and you are merely motivating players to do the same things. I wish you would do more to promote the good in Twitch by playing Minecraft speedruns all month rather than this awful swill.

[3:26:41] a_wesker1: pasinge in a tuned dungeon ICANT
[3:26:42] cook_pc: if you grey parse you are missing an arm
[3:26:45] LightBladeStream: retail BM hunter is harder than every spec in SoD to play ICANT
[3:26:49] Bishox: skill is a small part of it , just making sure you are always casting , pre cast and not fuck up the simple rotation
[3:26:50] CaravelGaming: Hey JokerD, each time I watch you are playing the black and white version of WoW. Could you maybe stop being poor and pay for the colour version of the game? 󠀀
[3:26:51] nickylas: you could literally do the worst comp ever and slowest kill timer and still get 60%, its such a cop out coping for gray parses
[3:26:55] tw1ZTER: theres no good people on wow classic, the content is not challenging enough to rule out good from bad YEP
[3:26:56] piperboi: Logs and addons are the things destroying WoW, Weakaura is the worst addon ever made
[3:26:57] blazewa: a player with green or blue parses could maybe have purple parses in a good grp set up
[3:27:05] Muffufu: @JokerdTV Bring only gray parsers for your gnomer raid next week?
[3:27:08] trmonx: I am clicker with no weakauras but my green parse is because of raid comp and slow kill time
[3:27:12] hystelios: i did less damage today with full buffs and better gear cause i wasnt getting PI this time KEKW
[3:27:21] VaaLxD: I went with 6 shamans in Spergatory, nothing but WF and couldn't do more than 70 as meele hunter :D

[3:27:53] Exusprime: who the heck cares about a 60 parse. Thats like getting a score just putting your name on exam paper
[3:27:53] Bishox: biggest deal is world buffs on you and the raid
[3:28:01] diabetesman1: I mean i got a 98 parse as fire without lock, pi and boomkin. Just got like 8 crits in a row with a 1k ignite rollijng
[3:28:01] sending123: whats big is criting a lot for hot streak
[3:28:05] bleezy16: de ting Okayeg
[3:28:08] Bishox: if your entire raid has DMF and Gnomer buff, its insane difference
[3:28:08] BallsAreForsaken: in sod its prolly pretty damn good lol
[3:28:10] deka7a: but u were saying its easy to get 95+ in a pug when bfd was current
[3:28:13] xm1ke: PI should always go for warriors for extra grenade dmg
[3:28:25] NotXasmur: YEP
[3:28:30] ardice1: that is 100% true and your lying your best was not a 700... You dont have to try to parse, and 60 is FINE its the people with fucking grey parses that dont deserve to raid, if you get a grey parse youre not even trying, and you need to run dungeons before you raid.

[3:35:33] TORTELLUCI: @piperboi i see what ure saying but to be fair the likelihood that ure going to do mechanics correctly is higher if u also parse higher

[3:53:14] farmpapi: gotta spend money to make money CAUGHT
[3:53:14] tw1ZTER: you need gold to make gold
[3:53:15] vosa5: Because you need certain amount of gold to start with GDKPS
[3:53:17] Frelle1: people buy gold to have the budget to join KEKW
[3:53:17] jprat: because you have to buy yourself in first
[3:53:17] frostbg: 80% sell gold
[3:53:17] LightBladeStream: @makitahq no, any form of raiding outside of reprogressing every week with dogshit groups is bad ReallyMad

[3:53:25] Degn: people buy gold to get into gdkps, not to earn gold but to get items fast
[3:53:26] dedrateroserasdom: he's talking about the server they shutdown in china ok
[3:53:26] jprat: delusional take
[3:53:27] RedSniper6: IE GDKP is gold sellers, trying to make real life money
[3:53:28] blasnit: 80% KEKW ur clueless sorry
[3:53:33] Degn: cus they dont wanna commit to a guild

[3:53:40] LesrKa: How do you get into GDKP without buying gold
[3:53:42] Mythos_Chamber: They do it to make gold to sell LUL
[3:53:44] greta1500: I play GDKP op ERA. never bought gold. just farming the item. like in a regular raid
[3:53:46] Bishox: 100%
[3:53:47] mccan2110: its stupid they banned gdkps from pahse 2 , they should have done it from the start

[3:54:12] bearfukuu: Because some of the items going for 300k+ is fucked
[3:54:17] piperboi: The reason Wow token came in the first place was because of ppl buying gold
[3:54:20] Frelle1: GDKP would be awesome if there was 0 gold buyers
[3:54:21] nicopendais: ofc they did, but gdkps are the main reason people buy gold
[3:54:24] mike_aqu: yap yap yap
[3:54:28] nafk1450: one turd?
[3:54:28] 1up030: why did we go from DKP or Need/greed into GDKP´s anyway??

[3:55:41] jrdnpls: truuu gold for mount and random smaller things is more impactful in classic. wrath it's not hard to get gold for those things haha

[3:56:02] AdamNicholsMusic: true tbf
[3:56:03] CFGs27: since its the first reason people buy gold in wotlk, make thats why blizzard tries to ban it early in SOD, so it doesnt become a new version of WOTLK

[3:56:11] SGkieran: so many shit guilds have quit too, even some long standing good ones and just go gdkp

[3:56:28] Smo0by: most guild require 2nd chars too fuck that
[3:56:32] hystelios: Even if you join a guild not guaranteed everyone shows up KEKW
[3:56:38] arsonnic: dude raiding anywhere working 3rd shift in the U.S. is fucking terrible.
[3:56:38] 1up030: @KrazeBee idk man just normal rolling for items seems fairer to me than having more gold than others gives u more items

[3:58:04] KrazeBee: @1up030 Rolling you can end up with 1 person getting everything by luck and everyone else gets nothing in return. With GDKP you get a split of the total gold back, which you can use in the next run to buy stuff.

[5:20:58] ritter184: The classic experience is putting a weapon stone or poison on your MH only to get moved into the shaman group 3 mins later.
[5:20:58] nobody_knows_best: rogue kicks, always have one
[5:21:04] urmadlife: this mob is tanky as fuck

[5:21:43] egiop97: @jokerdtv what if they just gave rogues a buffing rune too?
[5:21:44] Poiula: Just give rogue a raid wide or group buff, its not that hard, why is rogue the only class with 0 buffs to party ?
[5:21:47] erobblovewatcher: yep, some classes scale way better with crit like warriors for example

[5:21:58] Demobalderes: @toter_s My favourite part is needing 5 shamans and then lusting 1 group twice so that every other DPS in the raid is mad that they're not in that group ok
[5:21:58] Revolverrr_: just make warrior god tier fck the other classes and multiplicatively buffs and dymanic scaling
[5:22:00] konexd: 10% crit is HUGE
[5:22:03] summerteeth: Smadge locks
[5:22:06] Melkor_Active: @JokerdTV they changed how ignite works tho. In classic it was multiplicative. But in Sod its now additive like in wotlk
[5:22:06] LightBladeStream: its not
[5:22:09] erobblovewatcher: that's why 10man is shit

[5:23:01] Bishox: raid wide would be nice yeah
[5:23:04] thrashbeer: @mysteriousm4n raidwide buffs (such as wf) would be amazing especially when they add 20man raids
[5:23:04] mpmicke: raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail raidwide buffs = retail

[5:25:41] Plandemics: Season of spergs
[5:25:41] blasnit: make tricks a rune
[5:25:43] mpmicke: @erobblovewatcher what hes asking for now BL on rogue ? see where im going ? ur the dumb fuck who wants retail into sod
[5:25:44] heckler_and_koch416: bro wow players are the gamers with probably lowest skill and brain out of all out there, its clear as day
[5:25:46] nobody_knows_best: we have 2 rogues in our raid, cleared gnome with 7 melee KEKW
[5:25:50] HarmReduction: tricks is also dps buff
[5:25:52] urmadlife: Give tricks whitout the damage buff
[5:25:53] Demobalderes: Threat is irrelevant rn if you have a shaman
[5:25:54] bluuu09: then make rogues really good tanks
[5:25:54] deywa7: youd bring a rogue on horde for sure if they had tricks
[5:25:54] renz94800: Give rogues a poison that increase spell damage on target.
[5:25:56] Demobalderes: But without shaman tricks is good
[5:25:57] Flaxenes: if rogue get tricks finally warriors can tank ?
[5:25:57] mamdoh123: not spending 20 energy on that shit man
[5:25:58] nicknack555: horde already has alpha from sham
[5:25:59] kuruixd: imagine tricksed ignite
[5:26:00] egiop97: @jokerdtv what about giving rogues a buff spell
[5:26:05] kuruixd: monkaS
[5:26:14] johnnyhopkinwead1: raid is a mechanic check not a dps check
[5:26:14] ritter184: I'm not doing anymore cringe tricks shit
[5:26:20] Gnarl93: 15% damage bonus, snapshot
[5:26:21] erobblovewatcher: @mpmicke ur clearly not listening to what he's saying moron, and you definitely don't know anything about retail lmao, schizo
[5:26:21] KrazeBee: Assassin's Creed: Gives your party members 15% attack/cast and movement speed
[5:26:26] Milktrain: EU
[5:26:27] johnnyhopkinwead1: gnomer is arguably just a mechanics/healer check
[5:26:28] bluuu09: we need rogue healer
[5:26:29] bolle_b: and maybe dont have time for like 3h raid
[5:26:34] bluebloo__: do it PogT
[5:26:36] Myndtricks: Bedge too much yap for me
[5:26:39] nicknack555: rogues need poison's gives some unique debuff or something
[5:26:43] urmadlife: hur dur but joker i cleaned a raid whit 9 rogues and we only took 20 trys and 2 hours more than normal so its okay ok
[5:26:46] swolygh0st: my point is this "toxicity" isnt about classes its about not wanting dead weight players in your raid
[5:26:54] malpikrol: its just cliking or not wipe gnomer
[5:26:56] mpmicke: @erobblovewatcher am i not hes asking for classes TO get same shit other have so u all get a deploma for playing. that happens in kindergarden when u got last in a running lap but got diploma
[5:26:57] renz94800: @nicknack555 spell damage increase on target.
[5:26:59] TwitchWo: will happen
[5:27:14] rawlexdota: Tbh, a warrior doesnt want another warrior in the raid amyway
[5:27:18] rickydangg: is this also not a bit of a 10 man issue?
[5:27:20] urmadlife: 1 rogue Deadass
[5:27:26] Rosabaum: 1 rogue already fucks perfect comp
[5:27:28] klikdonE: you 40 yet
[5:27:33] mpmicke: @erobblovewatcher whats the POINT to have diffrent classes IF all can do the same SHIT ? ur the deluted one
[5:27:38] KrazeBee: wonder how mandatory the epic fist weapon will be later on
[5:27:39] Ecru_Eagle: you could clear with 8 rogues sod is braindead
[5:27:40] erobblovewatcher: @mpmicke Are you drooling out your mouth? You type like you're mentally challenged. He's saying that rogues should get some utility at all so they actually get brought to raids lmao
[5:27:41] machalotelol: I mean u can do this on WOTLK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09xwK1VkCIs&t=141s
[5:27:41] YuruNeko1: Min maaaaaaax BatChestDance

[5:27:44] Alexrkkl: this is 100% why 10 man is an issue
[5:27:47] v0ak: i had two rogues, mt and ot and it went really well though
[5:27:48] urmadlife: @erobblovewatcher KEKShook
[5:27:50] Demobalderes: 1 rogue is fine, it's just that their DPS isn't good enough to warrant giving them a spot over 2nd warrior or 2nd melee hunter instead @JokerdTV
[5:27:52] RealDecon: yeah thats how its always been though... like last phase if you brought a mage you were hurting your comp because of how bad mana dps were compared to rogue, warrior, hunter
[5:27:53] iPlayCuzFun: paladin

[5:27:56] mpmicke: @erobblovewatcher once again WHATs the point to have diffreent classes IF all can do same shit ?!?!?!

[5:54:01] Bishox: increased to 300% works as well

[6:53:44] einself111: it is not really that toxic now, there are just very sesitive snowflakes in 2024
[6:53:44] veiloflonelystars: i remember a friend of mine who had a sick 1200 CRT monitor and 90 or 120 hz
[6:53:46] CaravelGaming: Chatting
[6:53:47] Provenskill: logging 2 button classic is just fuckin nuts to me, I can understand logging mythic or some shit
[6:54:03] gaming5150: Are you a toxic player of sod? sus
[6:54:10] veiloflonelystars: logging is much more satisfying in classic than retail tho
[6:54:10] allyofjustice: I don't remember job interviews in 2019 but that's because everyone played in guilds
[6:54:14] applefrombehind: SOD is from all Wow Expereiences the Worst ever Player Mix
[6:54:15] ZevenSins: Ego
[6:54:24] gaming5150: They dont do anything IRL so they log in game ICANT
[6:54:28] Mico027: Gotta find a use for that gear
[6:54:30] belliam99: Parsing is another way to play the game.
[6:54:31] taru_lifts: it always turns into gatekeeping
[6:54:31] MONNlBLAST: Even if its 2 button classic there are still bad and good plsyers. Shit argument
[6:54:36] Brelshar: Bad players just get mad that some people want to do better each time
[6:54:38] kelycoo: Its not a problem of logging classic, but flexing on classic logs
[6:54:38] miraagex: @Provenskill top guilds don't care about mythic logs in terms of dps. they want perfect mechanics and 0 deaths
[6:54:43] larhwek: No its not
[6:54:45] peat__: @jokerdtv it’s trash
[6:54:46] phrael: people who dont like parsing are just not competitive people

[6:54:51] cuties_tw: always been ther
[6:54:51] Milktrain: read PogO
[6:54:52] strangefruit: I think theres so much toxicity in SoD because its a very easy game to be good at and therefore low skillcap to be an "Elite Player". Its an ego boost and thats all it is
[6:54:58] meseuss: whats the point of getting gear if youre not trying to improve dam? lol
[6:54:58] belliam99: @Brelshar true. people that cant parse only say parse dont make sense
[6:54:58] Jefp07: Its just fun to parse for some people, really that simple
[6:55:01] just_a_slayer: that's a great reason to not invite someone
[6:55:02] MONNlBLAST: If they are green median theres a reason you dont want them

[6:55:38] 0_catalyst_0: people seem to care more about the logs than actually doing the mechanics correctly
[6:55:41] Lequack1: @gaming5150 something tells me you never had a high parse :D
[6:55:45] lasagnalord13: i quit raiding cause my guild group only has 2 ranged. me (a mage) and a spriest. wouldnt let me parse so what was the point in playing...
[6:55:45] RAGINGELEMENTAL: I only care about not getting grey quality players
[6:55:51] MONNlBLAST: @gaming5150 the 80% also say how the game is so easy but cant parse 99 if they tried
[6:55:52] TwitchWo: everybody cares about them
[6:55:59] Provenskill: exactly, it’s using it the wrong way. Mythic logs isn’t for parsing, it’s for seeing where you fucked up and took damage or how you died on progression. Mainly fixing and improving mistakes not just stroking your cock at dps lol
[6:56:03] gaming5150: @Lequack1 99.6 in ulduar as UH dk PogOff

[6:56:16] belliam99: only bad players dont care about parses if you noticed
[6:56:26] Brelshar: GS is actually bad in SoD tho, im 2 items from BiS and my GS would be better with some worse items
[6:56:37] veiloflonelystars: GS is dogshit in classic makes no sense
[6:56:41] z00mless: just ban all addons and you have difficult boss fights because dont have timers
[6:56:45] taru_lifts: logs would unironically be better for everyone if rankings/sharing logs wasn't there

[6:58:24] Carapuce1234: ok
[6:58:26] lasagnalord13: i swear some players won't press any utility that could save someone just because that 1 global doesnt do damage
[6:58:29] Brelshar: I think logs measure player effort and prep more than skill.. some people just want to play with others that put in the effort they do.

[6:58:57] ragingponer: if you are playing your class well and have an awful raid comp you can very easily hit 50+ on every fight.  someone with all grays over multiple raids is bad, that's all there is to it.  No one is screening for 99s
[6:58:58] nobody_knows_best: KEKW
