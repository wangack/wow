[7:31:21] alexjuegos2701: 2020Shred
[7:32:03] SilkeySmooth: pvp gear for honor and shorter ranks would be great
[7:32:12] yosdenfar: Interestingly @swifty Sarth was saying in chat the other day he has an inkling it’s a major overhaul to the system… think he has inside knowledge?
[7:32:42] scathez: @Swifty Do you think official HC will have BGs?
[7:33:00] SilkeySmooth: conquest grind is ez
[7:33:16] GarSeason: Wait you think theyre gonna scrap the ranking system on era?
[7:33:56] yosdenfar: Interestingly @swifty Sarth was saying in chat the other day he has an inkling it’s a major overhaul to the system… think he has inside knowledge?
[7:35:01] SilkeySmooth: @yosdenfar rxp and blizzard are in bed with each other its not that far fetched

[7:36:13] Vahri: vahriWave Welcome home!
[7:36:16] SilkeySmooth: blizzard did say the change is for the over all health of the game
[7:36:18] CruncherNA: im in your bg, im the boomkin
[7:36:21] yosdenfar: Do you want to hear a hot take @swifty ? I think the r14 grind makes your IRL situation influence in game power similar to the token haha. If you can’t put work and family aside you can’t rank.
[7:36:46] scathez: will there only be classic vanilla HC? or TBC as well?
[7:37:04] yosdenfar: @garforge they said it was a large update to the system to improve the health of the game
[7:37:13] yosdenfar: Rest is kind of speculation
[7:37:57] yosdenfar: It’s really silly.

[7:38:28] k4bigon_: @yosdenfar Thats not a bad thing. Games should reward you for more time put in, IMO
[7:38:37] GroovyBryan: Most of the classic players are adults now, and don't have time to grind out those ranks.
[7:38:43] yosdenfar: @borg_wow I agree with that
[7:38:48] regiiional: how was your trip swifty??
[7:38:52] yosdenfar: What I’m saying is you can’t chip away at it

[7:39:22] Vahri: No one should be grinding THOSE hours
[7:39:29] k4bigon_: Yeah, it's a barrier to entry indeed
[7:39:32] yosdenfar: I think it should be hard but you should be able to chip away at it
[7:39:33] freddy_fazbearrr: streamers can do it, but will be boring for chat maybe
[7:39:38] k4bigon_: I'm all for it
[7:39:39] Vahri: Game in moderation, dont skip meals and sleep
[7:40:15] yosdenfar: They should keep it “hard” but change the type of hard haha.
[7:40:26] GarSeason: Maybe make the rank 14 grind the same amount of honor as getting to rank 10 ish?
[7:40:30] freddy_fazbearrr: 1440p should be doable
