[0:29:41] miraagex: @TopicxTV lol what an entitiled opinion. do you live in CA that you don't consider 16k a massive amount of money?
[0:29:47] scorgie1994: the grand final should be a bo7 where the upper winner starts 1-0 and picks the dungeon they get a free win imo. still caps at 6 games so only 1 more than current

[0:31:32] Reluctors: @Chkndh echo, and a few others sure but a lot of these guys are not making a lot
[0:31:36] exomaths: Just as a fun event, I think they should switch pvp and pve casters for one arena/dungeon run. Would be fun I think
[0:31:41] mathrix__: Last Stand format would be kind of boring if you see them restarting on the first couple pulls 10 times in a row
[0:31:43] radhunt: no bolstering?  is this a signal they're going to remove bolstering from live
[0:31:45] radhunt: pls
[0:31:47] TopicxTV: @Chkndh I never said it was bad, I just said a little low. Not drastically low. It's just dwarfed compared to other esports is all.

[0:40:36] wildcherrybepsi: 3 min is strong plus pulsar
[0:40:37] penthexd: no you get procs
[0:40:39] Keppie__: Its pulsar so more incarns

[0:40:54] Big_5h1t: its the same incarn
[0:40:54] guynormally: he blew Tyr so hard
[0:40:55] Chimix1: 3 min incarn you get pulsar which lets you get incarn between pulls
[0:40:57] Olivens: if dont there would be no reason to choose 3 min
[0:41:00] dreadPack: But maybe if you spend more time healing, may not be worth it
[0:41:04] Taytor: 2 min incarn is actually stronger cause you get stellerflare and a damage proc
[0:41:06] realies__: why isnt banning specs already a thing? target banning would make it more interesting than just watching echo win...
[0:41:09] taanzfour: The CD itself is actually stronger on the 2 min but u just lose the pulsar
[0:41:09] SilverSpik: 2min+ aoe burst vs pulsar incarn procs choice node
[0:41:10] Taytor: but you have more uptime with pulsar on 3 min

[3:26:23] quarantedeux: they knew they were too far behind i guess
[3:26:23] ohfoeshow: prio diff stackd up throughout the dungeon
[3:26:26] kniftty: Would they know they are behind at that moment?
[3:26:27] Icycutes: "healer"
[3:26:30] ItMeMatt: drohgoh's build is so int
[3:26:35] Tresku: dorki xD
[3:26:36] dBt22: drohgo's build is bad
[3:26:36] reymargera: dorkiUSA 7
[3:26:38] poliadez: they win if smacked doesn't die tho
[3:26:40] sethron: peepoSad
[3:26:41] Everyafternoon: good bluff from last hope
[3:26:42] RedResolve: it makes a difference for sure shadow priest has funnel and they died
[3:26:42] Orenria: you never take crusade
[3:26:43] GearzxGaming: without the death on smacked they actually win there?
[3:26:48] ItMeMatt: he went empyrean power too
[3:26:48] arberonwow: allez mandatory
[3:26:48] lucid_wow: i feel like final reckoning build its just better to play boomkin no?
[3:26:48] thundamental: never seen anyone play crusade not sure
[3:26:49] Nox1o: @GearzxGaming no
[3:26:53] GearzxGaming: It would've been like withing 5 seconds
[3:26:54] Cruzerio: @poliadez COPIUM
[3:26:54] ZizzTV: Get Baited by a Scumbagger o7
[3:26:56] Nox1o: a death isnt double dmg
[3:26:58] Holysal: drohgoh weak link
[3:26:58] Exogenesis9: Crusade is about the same as 1m on average. But obviously it does better if you pull big on 2m timer
[3:27:00] honestabeo: There's zero chance they one phase
[3:27:00] Zaisx: dont think spriest w/ lust is 35%
[3:27:01] punkyeti: lost to incorp more than anything
[3:27:02] Nox1o: wasnt it like 40%?
[3:27:07] Mehdehh: @poliadez they dont get 35% with 1 death lmao
[3:27:07] YungBeepBoop: ez channel points
[3:27:08] TonyCookGaming: @poliadez Nah, they would have lost anyway. Needed to not have the incorp go off
[3:27:09] razortanktv: they wouldn’t have gotten full luster if they didnt
[3:27:10] GH0STtdi: dorki is cursed in mdi
[3:27:10] syzurup: how was last hope worse on trash even with AoE talents?
[3:27:12] talmadimtv: 35
[3:27:15] Szain3: Kappa
[3:27:16] quady89: that win was mandatory for them
[3:27:16] MBG_95: If they wanted to 1 Phase why is he playing FInal Reckoning
[3:27:16] Jacksprat47: crusade is more dam during the burst for the big pulls, but it has to live
[3:27:17] Rzayers: I mean if he doesnt lose voidform there it could be 1 phase
[3:27:21] fdb33: Crusade I dont think is worth, the crit from 1 min wings and 50% more uptime overall gotta be better
[3:27:29] Shroomztm: Ranged lost a lot of global with shit swams and spiteful
[3:27:30] Itsmefaxxie: mando only 10 sec or so slower than echo earlier
[3:27:33] Jacksprat47: @MBG_95 this
[3:27:38] Nox1o: they would need to do 50% more dmg. thats not if the priest is dead for 5sec before pi
[3:27:39] cixxay: they need to do 50% more damage than they did without death they can't 1phase I think
[3:27:39] Diinklebeeerg: its like all spiteful pad no?
[3:27:44] Ilidas: even if it wasn't their plan, they might have sent it because they knew they were behind
[3:27:44] ItMeMatt: he wasn't playing rush of light either for the single target haste
[3:27:48] fleks27: overall is everything
[3:27:50] Chamiunt: does mdi have public logs?
[3:28:00] umexd: big number>>prio dmg
[3:28:02] SneakyWoodPecker: @Maximum Not enough people talk about how Drogoh market corrected Growl
[3:28:07] KDaily: are there logs for this ?
[3:28:08] JayPuppa: awesome. im now broke.
[3:28:11] Nox1o: probably how mandatory caught up slowly
[3:28:14] syzurup: dumbgoh
[3:28:16] fireyaspen: My opinion effectively doesn't matter, but it feels troll especially with the dungeon being a tyran key
[3:28:19] punkyeti: this incorp was real bad
[3:28:19] Jacksprat47: were they thinking fire mage and shadow focus was enough maybe?#
[3:28:21] Exogenesis9: 1m wings is also SO much better for offhealing
[3:28:24] saladin955: with a bdk they would have won
[3:28:24] thundamental: i mean it showed on 2nd boss they started 10% late and killed him first
[3:28:25] ashla11: final reckoning gets way weaker if you dont use templars verdict though
[3:28:27] Ferrpull: did drogoh doing AoE allow someone else to go ST?
[3:28:34] Pyrrha_GG: FR in its window is more damage than ES even single target, if he wants one big dam window FR will be more, but ES is more over long term
[3:28:34] skyefist: last hope had -50% damage on 3rd boss sadly
[3:28:36] smolderdaddyuwu: @JayPuppa its the series. not games
[3:28:36] honestabeo: Smart money was always on mandatory. Drogoh is a habitual thrower
[3:28:39] erenbos93: incoporeal go off on 3rd boss
[3:28:42] ashla11: wow im dumb
[3:28:42] erenbos93: at the end
[3:28:47] TheGame402: 2sec diff is crazy
[3:28:57] wehiluss: padding in mdi ICANT
[3:28:59] nellfin: imagine drohgoh just forgetting to swap talents after a test
[3:29:03] ladden: only 17 sec diff to echos time with same amount of deaths
[3:29:03] theskot: lets get the dorki meters
[3:29:17] Kakoee43: why not public a log ?
[3:29:18] Crazy_like_fox: <3
[3:29:21] Nox1o: between 5 and 7min they lost like 20sec
[3:29:24] Diinklebeeerg: its a tyran key so you want prio more than anything no?
[3:29:26] Nox1o: to mandatory
[3:29:29] hiddenhyena: U guys remember how mekkatorque killed wildcard gaming lol
[3:29:30] kiriuped: Think crusade was a bad option imo
[3:29:34] Diinklebeeerg: you have priest adn lock for the aoe and prio too
[3:29:35] umexd: surely players are logging
[3:29:35] Flipeled: @Maximum only 17 sec slower than Echo
[3:29:37] cixxay: does effective dps just remove spiteful?
[3:29:39] Empirics_: I dont think crusade is the play
[3:29:40] Spritesgud: they have to log for the warcraft log boss map thing
[3:29:40] Fraantic: warcraftlogs is featured :D
[3:29:45] Fraantic: they should be logging
[3:29:47] Viisionz74: all logs would be in warcraft logs front page after an mdi run
[3:29:47] locokute: @Flipeled only OMEGALUL
[3:29:50] Mehdehh: Ain't no way they give public logs to give other teams full info on what everyone is doing
[3:29:52] x_Scy: publishing the logs after mdi is over wouldn't harm anyone xddShrug
[3:29:55] Kakoee43: well you would release it after MDI.
[3:30:06] Devastatedd: so what build was drogo?
[3:30:06] Flipeled: @locokute yeah, reading that now it sounds dumb as shit KEKW
[3:30:13] Nox1o: mandatory has rise tech for sure
[3:30:15] EnlargedForeskin: Swiggty Swooty USA AMERICA USA USA
[3:30:15] jmn115: @Maximum they have to be using logs since they do that map game using warcraft logs
[3:30:15] Empirics_: Chat they are logging but they dont have to make it public
[3:30:19] willethethunder: Max thinking Dratnos is cute <3
[3:30:20] BipolarPongal: When does JPC play?
[3:30:21] Nox1o: i believe

[3:30:55] literallywhylol: someone tell tettles to take a shower

[3:31:28] Nox1o: growl says they just copied echos old strat

[4:08:52] Shirey12: Did asmon ever say anything to you max?
[4:09:02] OXDOX: People mostly saw him as a tank and then realized he is goated
[4:09:04] JarakTapaL: @Maximum  why doesnt dratnos work for blizzard ?
[4:09:06] murtokqt: He also does so much tech/tactic work too

[4:11:08] Monsuno: @Maximum in-game integration for the event would be nice. why don't i get a little mail from Blizzard about it? why isn't it in the calendar?
[4:11:09] lucid_wow: perplexed is the closest i think in terms of competitors but the players are nowhere near as well known
[4:11:11] Nox1o: @meozart wasnt fraggo, who is in echo from paragon?
[4:11:11] StarShopping95: personalities carry
[4:11:13] malavander: number of top talent is a function of the size of the player base.  If 10x people played wow, there would be 10x top talent rising up
[4:11:14] InvaderZimAu: MDI lacks someone standing up with a BRICK on stream too
[4:11:19] murtokqt: Didnt people used to steam prac or atleast time trials?
[4:11:22] hearthledgerlol: Who is the new raider Liquid just tweeted about? @Maximum
