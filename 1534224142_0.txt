[0:28:47] polarbearchef: I like the modeling of the gear, but not so much the color schemes
[0:28:49] Rudric_Ice: if you use wow tools the helmet is shaded
[0:28:57] szble: think the monk set is really good
[0:29:13] backstreetalright: cool
[0:29:33] polarbearchef: shaman set is pretty on point I think
[0:29:37] Norbi33: so far maybe dk's set looks the best for me
[0:29:54] TheCliffyShow: That helmet reminds me of Juggernaut from X-Men 3.
[0:30:24] Molvonos: That's much better
[0:30:31] szble: the problem is the helm
[0:30:35] Molvonos: I think it'll look better on Belves and tauren
[0:30:41] LoseAlotLuke: theyre profile picture vs when you finally meet IRL @Towelliee
[0:30:53] bigoldoinx: looks meh
[0:30:58] Wcvechten: Concept always looks cooler vs ingame sadly
[0:30:59] lazyparkour8: I was excited about the shaman gear!
[0:30:59] polarbearchef: dude, my life
[0:31:16] polarbearchef: with 3 Tauren characters
[0:31:20] HardcoreDruid: Yo how’s the beta so far
[0:31:23] szble: angles bro
[0:31:27] Rudric_Ice: I think the helmet needs to be smaller
[0:31:38] Kale_Nd: let's hope the evoker's first tier set isn't getting screwed
[0:31:46] tronbadgames: @Towelliee the warrior looks like devestaror too
[0:31:57] polarbearchef: total outriders vibes, especially with the elemental feel
[0:32:04] Wcvechten: Warriors are blinded by rage, they don't have to see
[0:32:05] Electafuzz: they've released a lot actually
[0:32:15] LoseAlotLuke: why the feet, this developer needs investigating
[0:32:15] Rudric_Ice: Monk= ADD BALLS
[0:32:21] TheCliffyShow: The bluish grey color they are showing some of these in is not the best.
[0:32:22] LycanKain: Needs more balls
[0:32:23] xnorthtv: I feel like the colours on them are like Normal or heroic tier pieces
[0:32:25] polarbearchef: Harvey birdman, Paladin at law
[0:32:26] Vyrthur97: Everyset has TOES
[0:32:29] Norbi33: you cant really compare :D @Towelliee its night and day
[0:32:38] Sledgecore: bland colour
[0:32:45] Wcvechten: Really want to see all colour variations tbh, as it'll probably also get PVP colours
[0:32:50] shinpishugisha: reminds me of shredder from tmnt
[0:33:00] Rudric_Ice: the Mythic recolor is RED
[0:33:04] Rudric_Ice: btw
[0:33:10] mwchaos: Looks like jailer cosplay
[0:33:18] polarbearchef: maybe it's just modeling???   clay before the Glaze, ya know
[0:33:28] xnorthtv: I dont think theyre rocks. i think theyre dragon bones
[0:33:41] szble: its like eranoggs armor
[0:33:42] TheCliffyShow: Paladin looks like Juggernaut from X-Men 3. I'm the Paladin, bitch! Warrior just going to fight blind.
[0:33:45] Wcvechten: man wdym, DK is great
[0:33:54] PvtHudson093: the helm looks off
[0:33:56] backstreetalright: cool setes
[0:33:57] Rudric_Ice: they need to add sleek eyes to the head piece for warrior TBH
[0:34:08] thepresenterv: between these armors and the hogger furry redesign i wonder what happened to the art team
[0:34:13] UntouchedExodus: Your schedule blows my mind lol
[0:34:44] polarbearchef: oh yeah man, fuck uldir
[0:34:45] Shuttlelol: I was gonna say, Ulduar pally set was awesome
[0:34:56] Rudric_Ice: honestly the best looking set is the Warlock one
[0:35:02] SteramKurac: They are all same color variant and look very similar to one another. We are fucking rocks man.
[0:35:08] PlaguesqtRuin: RMP got eliminated today looool
[0:35:13] cptrogers123: Killed jailer today and looted 285 gavel!! :D
[0:35:52] TheCliffyShow: Dazar'alor loot wasn't that interesting either. Was basically, "add lots of bones and spikes everywhere.
[0:35:53] xnorthtv: @Towelliee Btw, i dont think they're rocks, as such. i think they're dragon bones on the tmogs. what are your thoughts?
[0:36:21] zsombee19: @TheCliffyShow For me that was one of the best looking sets.
[0:36:47] LoseAlotLuke: can we name our dragon?

[0:54:05] Xoyzor: do you guys think that it's worth getting into WoW with only one hour daily to play? I like to PvE on a semihardcore level but I think that with such a limited time I won't be able to archieve anything resonably meaningful in this field
[0:54:07] PadidinJones: Yaaaay @Towelliee after dark!
[0:54:41] hyboric: morning
[0:54:45] szble: maybe since you have 4 poisons

[1:03:34] CritcobainTV: cheap shot
[1:03:34] NinjaChane: ambush and garrote
[1:03:36] CritcobainTV: not kidney
[1:03:40] Molvonos: Er, Cheapshot
[1:03:44] tronbadgames: @Towelliee ambush cheap shot, garrote
[1:03:46] CritcobainTV: well, u can use kidney in stealth but u dont usually want to lol
[1:04:15] Revelations45: am I on your friends lost in Alpha @towelliee
[1:04:18] mighty_mouse: what UI addon is he using or is that ion game?
[1:04:26] CritcobainTV: The rogue tree is kind of weird, for sure
[1:04:32] Rottencoarse: @mighty_mouse  it's the base ui
[1:04:41] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Have we looked at the insanity of outlaw?
[1:04:43] szble: should get tiny shiv if its the only one working
[1:04:48] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I really hope there's a way to not have to have roll the bones
[1:04:57] Cafe0le: rogue trees are the best for sure
[1:05:03] Dragonnan_Drakelos: Greetings Towellie! Just jumping in to say, though I don't watch much of your content, I'm greatful for everything you do and have done for this community! Best wishes, much love to you!
[1:05:04] Chaoschef: can undead paladin cast turn evil on themselves?
[1:05:13] Dadghar: not big fan of the Rogue Primalist Class Tier the balls on chest look wrong
[1:05:30] CritcobainTV: Your opener from stealth will usually be garrote
[1:05:34] CritcobainTV: unless u need the cc
[1:05:36] NinjaChane: sap is stealth
[1:05:37] tronbadgames: @Towelliee surprised its building around shadow dance, and not echnoing reprimand the kyrian ability
[1:05:38] Storvn: Crimson vial
[1:05:41] CritcobainTV: silence + increased dmg
[1:05:48] tronbadgames: @Towelliee for leveling, shadow dance seems weak
[1:05:54] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  sap is stealth also
[1:05:56] roodenburgertje: I think there are many viable builds you can go for with rogue trees
[1:06:08] nightwolf_87: @Towelliee does items contain gem slots in this expansion ? :3
[1:06:12] szble: ya
[1:06:26] mighty_mouse: @Rottencoarse thank you for the response.
[1:06:27] Mooonwarden: you want finishers
[1:06:31] fumennen: @Towelliee have you seen the pala set on wowhead?
[1:06:36] Rudric_Ice: for assa u always open with garrote for pve
[1:06:42] Mooonwarden: in stealth to use during shadow dance
[1:06:47] Mooonwarden: no
[1:06:56] premierman90: @shutuproman you won’t have kyrian ability in DF
[1:06:57] Mooonwarden: u can use finishers
[1:06:58] ShackSupp: Playing Alpha sometimes feels likes boosting as a new player
[1:07:00] roodenburgertje: use garrote from stealth as assa
[1:07:05] CritcobainTV: no, it lets you use anything from stealth or out of stealth, so basically you'll use it to spam garrote and put finishers out
[1:07:07] Rottencoarse: muti is not a finisher
[1:07:20] tronbadgames: @premierman90 it's literally the 2nd to last in the center of the rogue tree on the bottom.. lol
[1:07:20] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[1:07:25] Rottencoarse: rupture
[1:07:27] szble: in dance just garrote and spam ambush
[1:07:33] NinjaChane: probably want Rupture and Slice and Dice
[1:07:46] CritcobainTV: as assassination you generally do Garrote, mutilate mutilate rupture on single target
[1:07:48] roodenburgertje: use ambush and garrote from stealth and dance
[1:08:00] premierman90: @shutuproman ahh made it a talent
[1:08:08] MrIndigestible: @Towelliee the stealth button is also at the bottom under the exp bar
[1:08:10] CritcobainTV: Fuck i want alpha so bad
[1:08:11] Storvn: Out of stealth abilities you will always want Are envenom, Slice and dice, rupture  as finishers. Slice and dice will need a constant uptime
[1:08:11] Rudric_Ice: if you missed it heres pikaboo's talents https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4cvnm6CW-0&ab_channel=Pikabooirl
[1:08:27] blackoutking: what is the fastest liquid on earth?
[1:08:30] szble: dps cd for you pretty much
[1:08:40] NinjaChane: ranged
[1:08:42] dinobille: yes
[1:08:43] CritcobainTV: that' s range, applies your poisons from a distance
[1:08:45] blackoutking: milk! it's past-your-eyes before you know it

[1:09:30] fudge65: whats the easiest rogue spec to level?> on class ive never touched
[1:09:34] xBlxo: yo
[1:09:36] tronbadgames: @Towelliee is there an option to make your bar not swap - with the new UI stuff?
[1:09:40] CritcobainTV: stealth and shadow dance are diff bars
[1:09:46] roodenburgertje: also use slice and dice

[1:09:52] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  you need slice and dance
[1:09:56] CritcobainTV: you just have to use shadow dance and put shit on it fast lmao
[1:09:58] Folgrum: u do it fast ;)
[1:09:59] szble: dance bar is stealth
[1:10:00] Godofwar94: have to use shadow dance and do it
[1:10:02] Elff11: in stealth
[1:10:07] Sledgecore: yeah do it fast
[1:10:07] NewQLer: naa they arent on retail atleast not for me. same bars
[1:10:09] Rudric_Ice: Shadow dance bar is the stealth bar
[1:10:11] ijuki: @critcobain it hasn’t been for me? slootS
[1:10:30] Storvn: Also need to have Shiv. Shiv increases your nature dmg cause of your talents. Which means more poison dmg @Towelliee
[1:10:34] stoop_kid69: They are the same bar. Not sure what that person was saying
[1:10:40] tronbadgames: @Towelliee its the same bar
[1:10:50] roodenburgertje: yes same bar
[1:10:51] NinjaChane: you will ambush, 5 point Rupture, garrote, 5 point slice and Dice, 5 point envenom. use mutilate to build points
[1:10:52] CritcobainTV: Oh, it might because of how i have my elv ui set up
[1:11:03] szble: thats vendetta
[1:11:05] Cafe0le: can you remove paging with the new ui ? dominos allows you to do it, bartender too
[1:11:06] stoop_kid69: Might be different on the alpha because assa typically doesn’t have shadow dance
[1:11:16] Rottencoarse: deathmark is the new vendetta @Towelliee
[1:11:19] tronbadgames: @Towelliee marked for death for sure
[1:11:20] szble: well the replacement dmg cd
[1:11:24] Rudric_Ice: its a bug
[1:11:36] roodenburgertje: deathmark is your big cooldown ability
[1:11:46] Kneckt: https://twitter.com/artemishowl_/status/1548555980736057345?s=21&t=NVPFxEG3uh8Z3OV784LyQg
[1:11:49] NewQLer: mutilate to build CP then apply bleeds then envenom after
[1:11:55] thatoneguynobodylikes352: mutilate until full money, spend money on envenom
[1:11:58] thatoneguynobodylikes352: that's the rotation
[1:11:58] ugubugu_: mark, kidne, mutilate,envenom
[1:12:17] szble: dots up spam mut and spend on envenom ez
[1:12:19] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Also, bleeds. Every bleed
[1:12:21] Storvn: @Towelliee  Stealth, garrote open, Mutilate, rupturee, mutilate til 5 combo, Slice and dice, Shiv, mutilate to 5, envenom. Keep rupture and slice and dice up at all times.
[1:12:24] NinjaChane: ambush, 5 point Rupture, garrote, 5 point Slice and Dice,  5 point envenom. use mutilate to build points @towelliee
[1:12:36] roodenburgertje: garrote -> slice and dice -> mutilate for 5 point -> rupture
[1:12:39] Kneckt: @towelliee https://twitter.com/artemishowl_/status/1548555980736057345?s=21&t=NVPFxEG3uh8Z3OV784LyQg lmao
[1:12:53] tronbadgames: @Towelliee bleeds and slice and dice asap
[1:12:54] ShadoodHD: KEKW
[1:12:55] BLACKFOOT_TN: When is Blizzard going to give us more fingers to operate all the keybinds we need to play wow now?
[1:13:01] Godofwar94: you need slice and dice
[1:13:15] roodenburgertje: slice and dice first
[1:13:22] roodenburgertje: asap
[1:13:29] thatoneguynobodylikes352: It's a prio. Garrote>Rupture>SnD>Shiv>Enven>Filler to dump energy
[1:13:31] tronbadgames: @Towelliee dont do 5pt slice just get it up asap, your other finisher will refresh it
[1:13:34] szble: prob have no haste so ass is even worse
[1:13:39] Reckless_Monk: u can use a 2 combo SnD
[1:13:47] Reckless_Monk: your envom refrshes
[1:13:47] Rudric_Ice: remove everything
[1:13:54] deschain_19: b;izzards been giving us the finger for years what do you mean
[1:14:08] Storvn: Shiv @Towelliee
[1:14:14] Rudric_Ice: on stealth just put garrote cheap and ambush
[1:14:17] Rottencoarse: shiğv
[1:14:19] Rottencoarse: *shiv
[1:14:36] NinjaChane: use shive when all bleeds are up
[1:14:40] Storvn: Shiv increases nature dmg ie Poisons, envenom, etc. @Towelliee
[1:14:41] BLACKFOOT_TN: Buffs damage
[1:14:43] NinjaChane: shiv*
[1:14:44] thatoneguynobodylikes352: 20% nature damage amp
[1:14:48] Kneckt: https://twitter.com/artemishowl_/status/1548555980736057345?s=21&t=NVPFxEG3uh8Z3OV784LyQg Invisabull is garnering attention KEKW
[1:14:52] tronbadgames: @Towelliee garrote, slice, marked for death, rupture/kidney if they'll die fast, then mutilate and envenom
[1:14:54] CritcobainTV: you use shiv after you have bleeds up and your deathmark rolling and you're gonna be spamming envenom
[1:14:58] CritcobainTV: increases nature dmg by 20%
[1:15:33] Arbszy: IT'S JOHN CENA! 👀
[1:15:36] NinjaChane: 5 point envenom
[1:15:50] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Honestly, this is just "JOHN FUCKING MADDEN" the spec

[1:15:51] renaerocks: @arbszy lol
[1:16:03] tronbadgames: @Towelliee you wont use tricks solo
[1:16:08] BLACKFOOT_TN: I just checked my Bnet. Still no Alpha. I too want to log into Alpha and then AFK in Org as the new race/class. This is BS man.
[1:16:09] Cackey21: Are the glasses for blue light?
[1:16:11] deschain_19: tricks doesnt need to exist anymore, theres no aggro lol
[1:16:21] tronbadgames: deathmark is the new vendetta
[1:16:21] CritcobainTV: yeah, you have a wrong talent if you take venomous wounds instead of venom rush (two talents to the right of vendom rush) you get energy back every time your bleeds do dmg to a poisoned target, so with death mark you'll be getting tons of energy. so its gonna be mutilate spam and dumping cb pts with envenom
[1:16:38] CritcobainTV: sorry long post lol
[1:17:00] Rudric_Ice: mark of death gives u a full set of combo points
[1:17:01] szble: less buttons might be better for towel
[1:17:07] Toon_irl: why doesn't preach have alpha btw?
[1:17:08] GameingAspect: !streamraiders
[1:17:10] ugubugu_: relog so it sticks
[1:17:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: lol every I watch you or Kala or Max, and Sloot. People are always just AFK on Org as the new dragons.
[1:17:27] BLACKFOOT_TN: *in
[1:17:35] gdtomii: @BLACKFOOT_TN are you sure you know the definition of AFK?
[1:17:38] Rinarii_x: @BLACKFOOT_TN Well yea, sometimes you gotta do stuff lmao
[1:17:40] CritcobainTV: opener is basically garrote, mutilate SnD, Marked for death then slice n dice
[1:17:44] dieupretre: did u check the new city ect @Towelliee
[1:17:45] Molvonos: I'd open with Shadow Dance, Mark of Death, Garrote, Ambush until out of Shadow Dance, then atypical Ass-rotation.
[1:17:45] thatoneguynobodylikes352: He's literally doing testing right now. That's bait.
[1:17:55] CritcobainTV: err rupture
[1:17:59] Tybow0811: So weird watching a Tauren do rogue things 😂
[1:18:01] CritcobainTV: im too fuckin tired its 3 am, i cant be giving advice
[1:18:05] CritcobainTV: marked for death rupture
[1:18:09] CritcobainTV: not slice and dice
[1:18:24] savobm: hi Towelliee, the evok-class what can all, dd heal tank?. have the evokclass a druid ?,thx sorry for my english.thx
[1:18:41] SaulMDGaming: How dare you do testing on new talents in abilities in an alpha Kappa
[1:18:43] Rudric_Ice: mark of death gives u a full set of combo points
[1:18:51] snake_like: since legion I hard copium'd that poison bomb would become a manually used ability. why god
[1:18:56] tronbadgames: @Towelliee exsanguinate is pretty lack luster tbh, it's a shame
[1:18:57] BLACKFOOT_TN: lol why you guys defending strangers against a person obviously being sarcastic?
[1:18:59] dutchie76: you see Vegas tonight Rob?
[1:18:59] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @Towelliee does mutilate still require daggers?
[1:19:01] BLACKFOOT_TN: Hmmmmm
[1:19:02] hirosan84: hey @towelliee. do you think mages are going bye bye when Dragonfligth comes out
[1:19:06] Sphinx2k: that talent tree is crack for min/maxers
[1:19:10] NinjaChane: mostly
[1:19:12] CritcobainTV: marked for death is AMAZING for m+ it resets if the mob dies
[1:19:18] silodin: that's how i did it
[1:19:21] NinjaChane: I use it for Rupture or full envenom
[1:19:22] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @savobm ranged damage dealing and healing.
[1:19:22] RaginTxn: pretty much
[1:19:25] snake_like: crimson tempest these days lol
[1:19:26] Rudric_Ice: yes
[1:19:28] Walshey: 4Head sarcasm

[1:20:08] NinjaChane: and shiv after four 20% increased nature damage
[1:20:18] PadidinJones: Wooooons
[1:20:24] CritcobainTV: yep that one is insanely good
[1:20:38] Godofwar94: that is a must have
[1:20:40] TombStoneMercenary: is there any glaring issues so far from what you have seen in alpha? @Towelliee
[1:20:46] CritcobainTV: venom rush is "eh"
[1:20:49] CritcobainTV: its not bad pure ST
[1:21:22] CritcobainTV: dashing scoundrel is good in the middle
[1:21:48] Godofwar94: TTVFatboyiii you have to run
[1:21:48] BLACKFOOT_TN: Are they gonna buff poison damage?
[1:21:51] szble: you would think
[1:21:51] CritcobainTV: you'll get more energy than you can spend during death mark
[1:21:51] gdtomii: @TTVFatboyiii there will be no dungeon finder, but more like the group finder from retail
[1:21:59] Breeklichtje: @TTVFatboyiii dungeon finder came in Woltk, but it was server based at the beginning
[1:21:59] ugubugu_: o.0
[1:22:12] snake_like: missing 3 frost shard dashing scoundrel assassination

[1:23:22] NinjaChane: it's interesting since Assassin never has had Shadow dance lol
[1:23:25] snake_like: probably to refresh garrote
[1:23:29] Rudric_Ice: shadow dance is not really good for pve as an ASS
[1:23:29] Breeklichtje: was shadow dance not a get away button :P
[1:23:32] Godofwar94: normally yeah, it increased damage, and line it up with cds if possible
[1:23:43] tronbadgames: shadow dance without improved ambush seems weird
[1:23:43] Fusionxw: WoW in 2022 OMEGALUL
[1:23:44] BLACKFOOT_TN: Yeah seeing Assas with SD is weird.
[1:23:51] szble: use it whenever you need dps i guess idk how good it is
[1:23:59] roodenburgertje: i would have gone for thistle tea in stead of dance
[1:24:02] NinjaChane: it's good, but it is weird
[1:24:04] gdtomii: JPC does know what hes talking about usually too
[1:24:05] CritcobainTV: Shadow dance might be good when used with cooldowns for burst
[1:24:13] devolore: hello Terry and I are hanging out and we both agree u a bitch
[1:24:16] roodenburgertje: think thistle tea is much better for assa

[1:30:50] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @towelliee exsangunate removes your bleeds
[1:30:57] pavepawns: envenom
[1:31:00] CritcobainTV: exsanguinate makes your bleeds expire 100% faster (maybe 50 now?) so u have to apply them faster
[1:31:02] NinjaChane: full envenom
[1:31:02] Stonekekw: PvP
[1:31:08] xindianx: maybe garrote?
[1:31:13] CritcobainTV: envenom for sure

[1:31:52] thatoneguynobodylikes352: cold blood doesn't work on dots, so only direct damage
[1:31:55] Vattss: You switching to rogue or just trying it out?
[1:31:55] CritcobainTV: It's a lot for sure, and it's changing up a good bit in DF
[1:32:10] CritcobainTV: Unfortunately I can't afford the xpac atm, so i'll be playing classic for the foreseeable future

[1:33:35] roodenburgertje: is it still fun after few days?
[1:33:35] axehold98: hi @Towelliee. I can see you have keybind 1 through 0, what kind of keyboard do you use to comfortably hit those keys

[1:35:02] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Honestly I would spec out of exsangunate for questing, depending on the mobs HP it might not even matter
[1:35:12] nickdachamp: All these cool arcane magic attacks from the NPCs, I hope Arcane mage gets some new stuff

[1:36:27] axehold98: hi towelliee. I can see you have keybind 1 through 0, what kind of keyboard do you use to comfortably hit those keys
[1:36:34] roodenburgertje: depends on points spent

[1:54:04] net_mi: @gdtomii no mad, just informing ppl what the rules are LUL
[1:54:06] PezMan123: is there many class changes and gameplay changes from SL? are the talents impactful or just glorified built in passives we already had?
[1:54:25] Bortslay: does this expansion "feel" like any old expansion? Or does it feel like something new entirely?
[1:54:30] CrunkyBrewster: uh ohs

[1:58:12] thatoneguynobodylikes352: So for bigly envenom hits

[2:00:48] Wolfenhoof: @Wickerman87 Yes we are ! Graceful and sneaky. We are the living shadows.
[2:00:51] szble: dungeon tuesday?
[2:01:31] tronbadgames: @Towelliee so when you're thinking about shiv and exsanguinate.. those arent really the synergy. shiv is for poisons, exsanguinate is bleeds.
[2:01:39] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[2:01:42] Wickerman87: are ye gonna main rogue or u just rotate through available classes now?
[2:01:57] szble: yeah for sure
[2:01:58] NinjaChane: when you get a kill when Mark for Death is on cooldown, it resets if you kill within 1 minute
[2:02:01] TheCliffyShow: Crit and Haste
[2:02:24] NinjaChane: haste is main Stat for more ticks for bleed and poisons
[2:02:32] KaisenSiru: Alpha Pog
[2:02:43] tronbadgames: @Towelliee shiv makes your poisons hit harder. exsanguinate makes bleeds hit harder by going faster
[2:02:50] thatoneguynobodylikes352: holy shit. 4. minutes of ads
[2:02:56] Truthseeker96: usually the more you can spam your rotation the better for dps
[2:03:02] TheCliffyShow: Your opener is also super important. Your numbers will suffer bad if you fuck it up.
[2:03:29] Wickerman87: chat!? anyone knows if racials got changed anything?
[2:03:42] NinjaChane: also if you use Mark for Death and kill within 1 minute it resets mark for death
[2:03:45] Norbi33: @Towelliee if you open up the achi's and exploration does it shows any loremaster reward for completing all the zones in dragonflight?
[2:03:55] metavahn231: i think you just spam sinister strike some times and then use eviscerate thats how you play rouge
[2:04:00] NinjaChane: yes
[2:04:02] Truthseeker96: yea lol
[2:04:24] dutchie76: the whole strip in las vegas was on lockdown tonight
[2:04:30] dutchie76: crazy

[2:05:11] dutchie76: yea
[2:05:20] dutchie76: cover up
[2:05:20] tronbadgames: @Towelliee it's just an assassin thing with envenom
[2:05:32] sLogOG: how often does the alpha gets updates?
[2:05:38] dutchie76: to protect the tourism
[2:05:40] metavahn231: i would switch to the spec thats most like classic rogue it was best rogue
[2:05:41] dutchie76: lol
[2:05:45] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Does mutilate require daggers? Please, I must know if I'm going to be locked into a spec by loot drops for yet another xpac

[2:06:11] iloveyalunn: More mass shootings in america? not suprised
[2:06:11] Naethix: @Towelliee How does DF feel so far? Lots of "same same" or something different?
[2:06:12] Hotshotss70: Hotshotss70 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:06:13] dutchie76: if any

[2:06:32] dutchie76: thats right they delete characters
[2:06:41] Rudric_Ice: so the prepatch is going to be full of primalists they've got a bunch of events for all the four elements in Ungoro, BadLands the barrens and Tirisfal
[2:06:51] dutchie76: @Screamnsteam LUL
[2:07:06] reactive_author24: @screamnsteam hahah
[2:07:07] szble: prob gonna reset
[2:07:07] sLogOG: how does the build sharing system works? can't you "save" your build and use it after?
[2:07:12] Strex03: or they scale you down
[2:07:30] Rudric_Ice: tweet let me link it

[2:07:59] sLogOG: how does the build sharing system works? can't you "save" your build and use it after? @Towelliee
[2:08:03] dutchie76: LUL
[2:08:13] metavahn231: 3 delays min
[2:08:14] DarkviperTV: @jetsun_401 Play it so you can test
[2:08:23] dutchie76: so weird seeing a tauran rogue
[2:08:24] BigDaddyzz: this must be a copy paste of Coldarra in borean tundra in WOTLK
[2:08:24] FatChase: I think they're further along than we think, never seen an alpha so polished
[2:08:27] Harskare: are you happier with DF than you were with SL at this point in alpha?
[2:08:32] StoicTaurus: I don't think they care about "tuning" at this stage.. first wave of alpha is there just to check "if it works and flows from start to end"
[2:08:33] LeGoogs: Does it seem further along than you expected? @Towelliee
[2:08:38] dutchie76: i think it will be november
[2:08:39] tankprince125: MGM hotel had damage at the valet door, which caused the scare of active shooter

[2:09:05] reactive_author24: How many bugs have you encountered so far
[2:09:06] Screamnsteam: saving my vacation time for dragonflight instead of traveling the world EZ
[2:09:07] dutchie76: @tankprince125 yea people said they saw blood and heard gun shots too
[2:09:23] Charliex302: @Screamnsteam thats the fucking spirit haha!
[2:09:25] brutaltv: its so strange to see a tauren rogue haha
[2:09:27] NinjaChane: yeah and if we get a phase a week roughly, then alpha is maybe 1.5 months
[2:09:40] Naethix: @Towelliee How does DF feel so far? Lots of "same same" or something different?
[2:09:41] sLogOG: i think if they focus on zone by zone, content by content each week, they will get more controlled data/feedback and can work on them

[2:11:14] hikaritd: @Towelliee Do you think they will launch a new wave Alpha invites on Tuesday?
[2:11:16] ACrankyGooose: tauren rogue
[2:11:18] ACrankyGooose: what a meme
[2:11:27] szble: tuesday
[2:11:30] Harskare: @Towelliee are new classes normally available in prepatch?
[2:11:32] silleye_: No that was last weekend
[2:11:39] CYNIC308: hit stealth hows the sneak animations?
[2:11:44] s0lstep: 25th is timewalking
[2:11:45] dutchie76: this reminds me of borean tundra
[2:11:46] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Best moments from the legion pre patch was someone complaining about the reaver being real hard and some else replying "have you tried throwing a king at it?"
[2:11:47] TooLock: @hikaritd with SL they did no second wave for Alpha, the second wave was with the start of beta
[2:11:50] BLACKFOOT_TN: New expac leveling bud. I already got all my SL characters done.
[2:11:52] polarbearchef: is TW really that good for leveling to 60??

[2:12:01] Bardiyo: @Towelliee who is the big bad boss in dragonflight expansion ?
[2:12:05] BLACKFOOT_TN: I remember they nerfed dung XP last I heard
[2:12:07] Mojohusk: @dutchie76 Exactly
[2:12:09] silleye_: @polarbearchef yes it is
[2:12:24] atoker: did you try going leatherworking to craft yourself better gear?
[2:13:03] snake_like: RNG procs on a talented aoe ability has always felt ass
[2:13:10] TheCliffyShow: Weird dragon lady with bird beak.
[2:13:20] BLACKFOOT_TN: All I heard is he's a dead boss soon.
[2:13:21] szble: prob murozond, galakrond, or some new cosmic
[2:13:30] Godofwar94: ok that flying looks dope
[2:13:31] Nukester500: arent there new enemies in dragonflight kinda like  offbrand ogres
[2:13:35] allisonkielle: There are theories that it will be Galakrond
[2:13:50] NinjaChane: glad it isn't recycled bosses
[2:13:57] KhronikRage: Mists was severely underrated.
[2:13:58] Rudric_Ice: there are some new Racial abilites i can link it you if you want @Towelliee
[2:14:00] zysmos: sire was great
[2:14:01] reactive_author24: The 4 horsemen will help us defeat galakrond lol
[2:14:04] TheCliffyShow: The ongoing theory with the eventual big bad is it's going to be Murazond. Galakrond or Chromatus are also good contenders.
[2:14:05] sLogOG: the voice actor and the music played a huge part of that tho
[2:14:10] metavahn231: Jailer comes back
[2:14:12] BLACKFOOT_TN: Meeting the big bad behind all the big bads and then killing him shortly after meeting him.
[2:14:16] snake_like: maybe they can finally give us the Throne of Tides raid
[2:14:16] Maego1: and we still might see in future patches someone old as bad boi
[2:14:19] Milanesa_De_Pollo: leaked? Pog
[2:14:19] Truthseeker96: lol
[2:14:22] CommanderKrano: with the Visage form of the Dracthyr given a bonus to HP regeneration and all, is there an option to automatically switch into the visage after combat or do i really have to press the skill every tiem then? 🤔
[2:14:26] PadidinJones: @Towelliee if there is dragons there has to be Old God envolvement
[2:14:28] MeisterPetze: thank god
[2:14:29] Nukester500: the robot reprograms
[2:14:32] polarbearchef: Chromatus 10.1 Galakkrond 10.2 I hope
[2:14:32] cryptolegendary: You think Professions are going to be a good system ?
[2:14:35] LeGoogs: CANT WAIT FOR SHADOWLANDS CLASSIC
[2:14:43] FatChase: The final boss is Ragnaros @Towelliee KEKW
[2:14:48] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee isn't the dragon islands are over the prison of the old gods
[2:14:51] Quimby54: @CommanderKrano would be nice if bursting doesnt get removed
[2:14:53] deschain_19: i bet someones sevretly been a Dreadlord for sure
[2:14:57] BLACKFOOT_TN: Mathew Mercer is the biggest reason people love Sire. If it wasn't for his voice acting people wouldn't care so much.
[2:15:01] syncis: @towelliee thoughts of the new talent system ?
[2:15:01] deschain_19: secretly*
[2:15:01] zysmos: pretty sure there is an old god in dragon isles
[2:15:04] reactive_author24: do the drift!!
[2:15:09] TheCliffyShow: I hope we don't see a bunch of Old God/void shit. I'm getting a little tired of that stuff.
[2:15:16] Vattss: Shadowlands? Soulbinds? Conduits? what are you talking about, it's dragonflight - never heard of shadowlands, sounds like made up crap to me
[2:15:19] karter2811: i think Wrathion will be the big bad, wont be long till he gets corrupted and he wanted the dragon isles for something
[2:15:21] heatstreak_: i love how fast you go
[2:15:23] tronbadgames: it's super mario world but your cape is a dragon
[2:15:32] widetriv: how are u liking dragonflight?
[2:15:36] Maego1: wonder how the talent system will look for the dragons
[2:15:39] FatChase: @BLACKFOOT_TN Matt Mercer didn't voice Sire
[2:15:44] Rictue: @Vattss it didnt happen
[2:15:48] SunjammerIV: jailer era will last forever unless they replace the entire writing staff

[2:16:01] snake_like: It's C'Thun's brother C'Michael. He's pissed
[2:16:07] sLogOG: because legion is really special for me
[2:16:11] Noshpan: @Towelliee It's almost like gliding in the Batman Arkham games
[2:16:14] jetributions: outlaw is awesome
[2:16:21] szble: outlaw should be cool
[2:16:25] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I REALLY hope there's an outlaw build that doesn't require roll the bones.
[2:16:27] hikaritd: Legion had AP and grind and Titanforging, DF has uhmm.. nothing? Its too basic for me for now.
[2:16:33] Screamnsteam: Sadge
[2:16:34] neomonstr: I still hate blizzard for removing 'Combat' and making it 'Outlaw' Sadge
[2:16:35] Rudric_Ice: some guy found some new racial abilities in the wowhead discord in the racial ability section
[2:16:37] heatstreak_: the party cd reduction looks op
[2:16:40] thatoneguynobodylikes352: because I fucking HATE that button
[2:16:41] BLACKFOOT_TN: @FatChase Ray Chase ye u right
[2:16:43] tronbadgames: good old hemet california!
[2:16:46] Eithos87: he will come out of retirement
[2:16:51] PirateBob_: @thatoneguynobodylikes352 rtb is outlaw
[2:16:59] umorakii: why legion was the best pre patch @Towelliee ?
[2:16:59] Godofwar94: I hope so, alway mained outlaw
[2:17:02] Sovanos: tuning depedening
[2:17:05] Truthseeker96: I bet they bring back op legendaries
[2:17:07] Shady_XLVII: so how's the new patch looking?
[2:17:08] skumbagramz: RTB is what makes outlaw interesting IMO
[2:17:09] snake_like: there will probably always be a raid spot for 1 outlaw rogue
[2:17:12] NinjaChane: outlaw will probably be best for pve if I guessed
[2:17:14] Truthseeker96: since we wont have conduits and all that
[2:17:17] TheCliffyShow: I've always wanted to see Hemet die. His quests are boring, and his whole thing is, "I'm a great hunter, now go kill all these exotic beasts for me".
[2:17:17] bukka_hot: combat
[2:17:20] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @swordstick yes...I'm aware...that's what I said
[2:17:21] karter2811: the down time of waiting for the dragon to recharge doesnt feel great
[2:17:21] Sovanos: 1 Assa mandatory for raiding 1 outlaw for cdr buff
[2:17:24] GwenNightsong: is that a Tauren rogue???
[2:17:24] tronbadgames: outlaw for pve for sure
[2:17:24] broken021190: Haven’t been on in a bit. Is he playing with themattbase tonight?
[2:17:25] rosspirogue: Outlaw probably
[2:17:32] ShadoodHD: hemet? RETIRED??? i call bs on that one
[2:17:34] Noshpan: I'm biased & simply have always liked Outlaw back when it was called Combat
[2:17:38] scratches16: wait what... a tauren rogue??
[2:17:40] Godofwar94: as I see the talents outlaw has raid utility
[2:17:42] Wolfenhoof: @GwenNightsong Isn't it beautiful ?
[2:17:43] PirateBob_: Ass for raid and outlaw m+
[2:17:45] Shatraugh: ass just because its always been my favourite spec
[2:17:46] Sovanos: Assa > outlaw for raiding as it stands the cdr is for otherplayers
[2:17:52] Sovanos: Party
[2:17:55] Godofwar94: so you need one rogue in every party Kappa
[2:17:58] Elff11: party only yes, but its roughly 20 sec per min CDR
[2:17:58] MartyrTV1: 4 ourlaw rogs
[2:18:00] PirateBob_: Hard to tell without sim or dps meters
[2:18:00] MartyrTV1: and its entire raid
[2:18:02] MartyrTV1: wym
[2:18:03] snake_like: Subtlety moon2D
[2:18:19] zamoro285: all i care is that sub isnt meta lol i hate the way sub plays
[2:18:20] Vattss: Music POGGERS
[2:18:28] allisonkielle: Thats still a huge buff for raid. Pick classes with shortest/best cds and pumperino
[2:18:34] Manabucho: i mean put a outlaw into a party of 4 healers in raid and they can get cds faster
[2:18:35] dinnerfirst: why not we ran 4 hunters and locks b4
[2:18:39] Traffius: Is lvl 65 alpha starting lvl or is the lvling super fast O.o
[2:18:42] sLogOG: shinyboi
[2:18:46] rosspirogue: My rogue are definetly going tauren! Love it!
[2:18:48] Eithos87: every class can be a rogue, priest, and mage come dragonflight
[2:18:54] smiley7878: looks like these models never change
[2:18:57] exile2502: looks so silly, rogue tauren
[2:19:03] metavahn231: this isent FFXIV..not much balance in WoW so why not
[2:19:05] broken021190: Haven’t been on in a bit. Is he playing with themattbase tonight?
[2:19:09] Wolfenhoof: @Traffius It will be somewhat slower than in SL Ion said. It maybe buffed in alpha though.
[2:19:10] FatChase: The new models look so good
[2:19:10] allisonkielle: @Traffiu 65 is starting point atm
[2:19:13] Sovanos: The problem with rogues now is that if you want to play Sub you would be the 3rd rogue in the raid if it stays like this
[2:19:13] Nevindaz: dracJAM
[2:19:16] Dolco: Tauren rogue is cringe tbh
[2:19:21] sLogOG: there is an npc levels you up to level65 for alpha @Traffius
[2:19:26] cta62: @Towelliee what made u stop playing Lost Ark so quickly
[2:19:38] snake_like: sub isn't fun to play as kyrian. they took all the controlled aspects and threw RNG all over it with the tier set, shadow techniques, and kyrian
[2:19:38] reactive_author24: Lol
[2:19:39] polarbearchef: draenei rogue or bust
[2:19:40] arrk___: whats the first raid?
[2:19:41] szble: tauren > vulpera
[2:19:48] Traffius: Ok thats good. I hope lvling feels a bit better then in SL
[2:19:51] BLACKFOOT_TN: Meh tauren warlock.
[2:19:53] Wolfenhoof: Tauren > rest
[2:19:54] TixesDT: How do you feel about dragonriding so far ?
[2:19:56] shalfey4: Good morning chat
[2:20:01] DarkviperTV: thats dumb
[2:20:03] Rudric_Ice: New RACIAL ABILITIES Pog ?
[2:20:04] Sleepylol93: I mean, they added a lot of race class combos, tbh you should play every class with every race
[2:20:04] jeflag: PETA mustve gotten him
[2:20:07] polarbearchef: dream retirement bruh
[2:20:07] JustMible: i'd call that excellent retirement. nice and easy
[2:20:16] Manabucho: he gotta retired at some point
[2:20:41] thatoneguynobodylikes352: He was an old ass man in fucking classic
[2:20:48] thatoneguynobodylikes352: He's canonically ancient
[2:20:50] TheCliffyShow: And regales you with stores like, "this one time I killed a fierce tiger in Stranglethorn. No, I didn't have a random adventurer do it. I did it myself. I swear!"
[2:20:57] heatstreak_: hes a dwarf
[2:21:03] Rkn1: the game nned more rain areas like un'goro
[2:21:12] Manabucho: hemet was allready old the first time we met him
[2:21:14] tronbadgames: hemet used to be a retirement community.. then meth took over
[2:21:14] Vattss: I remember when Anduin was just a little kid
[2:21:14] LootFeverTV: hemet was already old back in stranglethorn
[2:21:14] SteveOwloki: Harrison Jones?
[2:21:15] z0mbawa: frfr
[2:21:17] LeGoogs: Stop PepeHands
[2:21:19] CommanderKrano: We play elfs, we dont age Kappa
[2:21:24] BLACKFOOT_TN: He's been with us for decades at this point. I feel old AF if I remember taking his quests in Wrath.
[2:21:27] Ninwa: 16 to 34 :/
[2:21:29] polarbearchef: I'm over twice as old as when I started playing :/
[2:21:30] TheShadowOfWar1: hey Im new to WoW do you have any tips ?
[2:21:31] MrCheshireCat_: who u talking about?
[2:21:33] NinjaTexan: watch him be a greeter at the auction house by the end of the xpac
[2:21:35] Wolfenhoof: I remember Baine was a little calf :/
[2:21:35] Molvonos: I was 22 when I started playing WoW.
[2:21:43] polarbearchef: @Ninwa lmao same
[2:21:45] z0mbawa: 18 to 29
[2:21:46] TheCliffyShow: Speaking of people aging in WoW, is Moira's kid still a baby?
[2:21:51] Molvonos: Now i'm the ripe old age of 'fuck my back'
[2:21:51] Rudric_Ice: Heres the Racial ability link @Towelliee  https://twitter.com/Portergauge/status/1548437775522754560?cxt=HHwWgMCj7f38k_0qAAAA
[2:21:52] shalfey4: Is that a new standard UI?
[2:21:54] Eithos87: did you trim the beard recently?
[2:22:05] BLACKFOOT_TN: Dude our characters are retirement age by now right?
[2:22:11] fridostv: Xp is reduced in alpha or? Seems you lvl so fast
[2:22:12] akaari5486: Started playing wow as a kid back in tbc,now im 27 god damn :D
[2:22:12] jeflag: i rmb when garrosh was just a young orc. whatever happened to that guy?
[2:22:13] iAm_Fox: tauren rogue? wat
[2:22:31] TheCliffyShow: 20 years old, and still a baby. He's like Baby Yoda.
[2:22:36] jpopei: @Towelliee what GPU are u using towelie?
[2:22:41] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @thecliffyshow I mean, that was only like 5 years ago canonically

[2:23:00] KaisenSiru: Jebasted
[2:23:04] shalfey4: Tauren rogue got me real hard lol
[2:23:10] Funderik: a lesson here is, not everything datamined is final.
[2:23:16] metavahn231: this is grasping for straws KEKW
[2:23:20] Screamnsteam: its real towCopium
[2:23:21] Clotic_: venthyr race Pog
[2:23:23] Rudric_Ice: idk i saw it lol and i linked it
[2:23:38] szble: maybe its for dracthyr covenants?
[2:23:38] Browniepoint: venthyr race confirmed
[2:24:10] thatoneguynobodylikes352: szble that makes sense actually
[2:24:14] iAm_Fox: lightgrove sounds like tier set
[2:24:16] NinjaChane: covenants as allied races?
[2:24:22] metaphased: looks like paladin talents tbh
[2:24:24] szble: except for like 2 idk
[2:24:40] piediddly: I'd rather be a San'layn than a Venthyr
[2:24:48] Funderik: it's like they played mouse wheel roulette and just picked whatever sentence the mouse stopped scrolling on in that discord.
[2:24:49] Genilort: door of shadows
[2:24:52] jpopei: @Towelliee what GPU are u using my lovely streamer?would love to know!
[2:24:56] thatoneguynobodylikes352: some of them sound like tier sets to me
[2:25:10] Rudric_Ice: @jpopei hes using a 3090
[2:25:12] IronPhalanX: sound like pally talents got mixed in
[2:25:31] Funderik: it's fake, move on from here, nothing to see.
[2:25:33] Wolfenhoof: The SL races as allied ones would be a complete fuck in the ass for any lore. I want tauren warlocks and flying kodos then as well.
[2:25:33] skoxxinator: are those maybe class "racials"?
[2:25:38] szble: yeah think pally talents in there
[2:25:48] Moooogly: @Towelliee Can you get deeper strategem twice as outlaw? It looks like its in both class and spec talent trees, making kidney shot 8 seconds?
[2:26:23] Funderik: they datamine shit from 2007 still from now and try link to new expansion shit
[2:26:31] NinjaChane: could be interesting if we got Covenant allied races
[2:26:32] Sovanos: Outlaw
[2:26:33] thatoneguynobodylikes352: ass
[2:26:37] piediddly: I lean towards it being fake, due to one of those abilities being called a "patronus form"; that's a Harry Potter thing
[2:26:38] Elff11: outlaw by far
[2:26:38] superluboss: wait tauren rogue? but why it doesn't make sense
[2:26:38] Artiiz: Ass
[2:26:42] Genilort: red shirt guy is better than wowhead to predict haha
[2:26:43] Screamnsteam: sub
[2:26:44] elandura: I'd say they're about the same
[2:26:53] snake_like: outlaw you hit buttons faster, assa might have more buttons to press
[2:26:54] Sovanos: Outlaw has the highest APM + CDR on hiting buttons + fantasy is press everything of cd
[2:26:56] TheCliffyShow: A lot either way.
[2:26:59] bun_bunz_: @Towelliee Outlaw is alot of fun rotation wise, cuz it's never the same if you animecharge your combo points.
[2:27:03] Artiiz: Assa you need to focus on your dots being up at all times
[2:27:07] Moooogly: outlaw def harder
[2:27:08] TheCliffyShow: I think Assassination is harder.
[2:27:10] Djulio: I'm just happy with the way they're saying they'll be approaching alpha and beta where we hopefully won't get as many story spoilers and such long before the game releases
[2:27:11] Spaazzm: Outlaw harder than assa for sure
[2:27:11] szble: outlaw just has high apm
[2:27:12] NinjaChane: I would say assassination is easiest
[2:27:13] xotankkk: ass was always t he easiest
[2:27:13] MrFariaH: outlaw is way easier
[2:27:15] sheerheartattackyk: assa is easier imo
[2:27:16] zamoro285: i find outlaw to be easier, but theyre both not bad at all when you get the hang of them
[2:27:16] Sovanos: Outlaw is press shit on cd but getting Really good at outlaw is alot harder
[2:27:16] heatstreak_: Getting good rolls ishard lol
[2:27:20] GiiGa07: ass easier
[2:27:21] MrCheshireCat_: sub is most difficult
[2:27:23] gold9871: outlaw is more proc depended
[2:27:27] Funderik: chat doesn't know which is harder by looks.
[2:27:27] absanol: absanol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! 
[2:27:31] Wolfenhoof: @snake_like We are the moo out of the shadows, it makes complete fine sense.
[2:27:37] NinjaChane: sub is definitely harder than either
[2:27:38] Manse06: @Towelliee are you excited for DF?
[2:27:45] TheCliffyShow: Roll the bones
[2:27:47] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Assassin is dot spec, outlaw is reaction to rolling the bones. But you don't have to take it
[2:27:48] NinjaChane: but I think assassination is easiest
[2:27:53] shalfey4: Tauren - Pirate Tmog - Outlaw!
[2:27:53] Ponickz: outlaw is easier proc based
[2:28:02] metavahn231: should i play that cat game on steam
[2:28:03] Wolfenhoof: @shalfey4 Indeed !
[2:28:05] Sovanos: Ass is predictable and you have a rotation  While  Outlaw is Min maxing the living shit out of your roles with the rotation being RTB-ambush-vanish-ambush-next depends
[2:28:10] thatoneguynobodylikes352: honestly Sub is the one I find easiest
[2:28:31] kimmo_gaming: God that bull is so hard to see when stealthed LOL
[2:28:38] kowaikokoro: outlaw is the most fun melee, imagine playing an pirate Pog
[2:28:40] jeanncz: Tauren rogue?
[2:28:40] ZakuzaGB: Morning
[2:28:59] snake_like: no cannonball barrage anymore moon2PH
[2:29:02] CommanderKrano: but you can be a pirate as an outlaw! yarrr!
[2:29:02] allisonkielle: subtlety is better
[2:29:03] ZakuzaGB: ive always said outlaw is like a different class
[2:29:05] Moooogly: I love the RNG in outlaw, its unique and keeps things interesting.
[2:29:05] NinjaChane: yeah which I think is why it is easier personally
[2:29:06] aleksmetha: gambling addicted ^^
[2:29:16] shalfey4: invisibull
[2:29:18] Darkterror141: what a chad
[2:29:18] ohhrion: they should just make RtB a 1 and a half minute or 2 min CD and give you a 5 roll everytime
[2:29:19] krisdahaka: invisible cow LMAO
[2:29:20] polarbearchef: ninja cow
[2:29:24] piediddly: I've never really cared for the rng aspect of rtb
[2:29:25] Wolfenhoof: Its so beautiful :')
[2:29:25] Sers994: hiding in plane sight
[2:29:31] metavahn231: i still think its not stealth at all and is very misleading'
[2:29:31] magicclicker: Tauren rogue DansGame DansGame
[2:29:32] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Outlaws RNG is more about just shifting the priority list. Each roll makes your rotation change slightly. And when you 5 roll it's just JOHN FUCKING MADDEN
[2:29:32] metaphased: that name fml
[2:29:32] Klutar: what guy
[2:29:34] BigG_SA: gota love gnome feet during stealth tho
[2:29:36] Nokterian: I like Sub Rouge its gigantic burst damage
[2:29:36] Wcvechten: he was so stealthy, we didn't even see him the past 20 yearas
[2:29:42] BogdanCaba: yep he is definitely invisAbull Kappa
[2:29:47] heatstreak_: those hoofs arent just for show
[2:29:48] ashwing_: LUL
[2:29:49] Nokterian: COW STEALTH
[2:29:54] TheCliffyShow: He's John Cena's pet cow.
[2:29:58] elandura: Comparing to the other expansions' alpha stages, this looks a lot more like a beta btw, I love the progression, and the level of UI errors are almost zero.

[2:30:07] holtrop: I like outlaw
[2:30:09] allisonkielle: @Towelliee thats what shadow dance is for
[2:30:09] Nokterian: LUL
[2:30:11] snake_like: outlaw could be tweaked to red mage levels. part of rotation ranged, the rest in melee
[2:30:12] Moooogly: @corupted812 then it would just be another burst cd liek everyone else. The rng with rtb is what gives the class flavour
[2:30:16] metavahn231: stealth should only work if youre in a bush
[2:30:21] shalfey4: Some rogue playstyles are more PvP'er
[2:30:22] dianthusnemo: so, no more painting the hooves red to hid the tauren in the apple tree? :D
[2:30:24] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee are any of the areas in Azeroth changed other than the new Dragon Isles?
[2:30:26] Screamnsteam: Outlaw is best KKona
[2:30:26] kowaikokoro: modCheck zone content
[2:30:27] oticai: imagine in that cinematic thrall and saurfang get ambushed by 2 giant tauren rogues
[2:30:28] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Sub is just about managing shadow dance. You just spam ambush and dump CP
[2:30:37] polarbearchef: MECHANICS!
[2:30:46] elandura: @Towelliee that's what I mean, polished-wise. This particular zone felt like it.
[2:30:48] kimmo_gaming: we need some dungeons to be tested
[2:30:48] NinjaChane: half the classes don't even have the new talents
[2:30:51] thatoneguynobodylikes352: @dianthusnemo I think they removed that jome
[2:30:52] CarlTheCatFish321: certainly is one of the more stable alphas
[2:30:54] ohhrion: @Moooogly true, but it can feel really really aweful when RNG says no and you dont get good rolls
[2:30:55] norasalom: rogue should have a option to pickpocket  players.^^
[2:30:55] holtrop: Theres multiple phases to the alpha right?
[2:30:57] thatoneguynobodylikes352: joke
[2:30:58] Nokterian: Alpha is like a small peace of the pie
[2:31:01] ZakuzaGB: i feel like the ground work is there for it all, hoping the lack of end game "systems" means they have more time to work on other stuff towCopium
[2:31:05] Nokterian: piece*
[2:31:17] Pike_man: @Towelliee What do you think about the UI improvements so far?
[2:31:40] metavahn231: 6 months Kappa
[2:31:41] danielthegathering: YES you actually play tauren rogue, LOVE IT
[2:31:42] TheCliffyShow: Hey, Towelliee! You heard about the trick with Shaman's Far Sight.
[2:31:47] Akermay: Can. You
[2:31:57] Akermay: Can you move the side bars?
[2:31:58] kowaikokoro: weakaura's are op KEKW
[2:31:59] shalfey4: Are we going to have a new garison in Dragonflight?
[2:31:59] headshot_hunter6: and the semi weakaura thing in the middle of your screen
[2:32:02] Funderik: elvui mater race
[2:32:04] heretic_sic: https://clips.twitch.tv/PrettiestSpikySwanFailFish-c4XsgwBXNVMQzdFl
[2:32:08] Truthseeker96: testing is meant for improvement so if they haven't released the rest of the game yet it means they are still working on the other stuff
[2:32:14] Maego1: for me this overhaul is enough to come back to from elvui probably :D
[2:32:17] Artiiz: There's just too much stuff missing from default UI for it to be matched even with ElvUI
[2:32:20] jetributions: ot
[2:32:22] superluboss: do we know who is the main villain in this expansion?
[2:32:28] LoseAlotLuke: im edgy as fuck so i like the black elvui theme
[2:32:33] GiiGa07: dominos player maybe can use default in df
[2:32:33] Moooogly: @corupted812 that is what keeps it interesting though, rng isnt for everyone but for a lot of people it keeps the rotation exciting.   i dont know if you raid but doing the same rotation over and over for 3 hours a night gets boring real quick for me haha
[2:32:35] TheCliffyShow: @superluboss Not yet
[2:32:38] elandura: if only they worked with elvui devs and implement it to WoW UI under advanced UI enhancements, that would be dope
[2:32:40] umorakii: but @Towelliee many streamers and high raiders said that elvui makes the gaming experience worse when you get those frames off
[2:32:41] jetributions: not having my addons is driving me nuts
[2:32:57] lithium364: how finished are the quests right now?
[2:33:07] Rudric_Ice: so beta gonna be out in the next month ?
[2:33:08] Truthseeker96: ohh ic
[2:33:13] aleksmetha: good idea by them ^^
[2:33:19] thatoneguynobodylikes352: I'm bad at the game, so don't want roll the bones. I want to have the same rotation
[2:33:22] Funderik: targetted testing/feedback is smart, even tho you itch to try everything, it's better for the game like this.
[2:33:22] mborgxd: Tauren rogue? damn!
[2:33:22] Truthseeker96: get more feedback that way
[2:33:29] danielthegathering: do you have subterfuge?
[2:33:56] allisonkielle: Arent they gonna do the next phase on tuesday
[2:33:57] ohhrion: @Moooogly lol fair enough and i do but i also main fury warrior and just dabble in pirate rogue, i love it personally but love fury to much not to main it
[2:33:58] ThQbi: Whats your oppinion for the alpha? Rate from 1 to 10
[2:34:04] kowaikokoro: the shadow priest tree KEKW
[2:34:05] JustMible: Do you also report any bugs you encounter?
[2:34:06] MrFariaH: + content - marketing. sounds good to me lol
[2:34:08] Cynicalbadger: Did you try warrior yet?
[2:34:09] NinjaChane: Shadow is crazy in alpha
[2:34:15] hakaeltn: why would you test a game for free, unless you are a content creator?
[2:34:27] allisonkielle: because its fun
[2:34:33] Funderik: it's better long term for testing/the game and gives us something to look forward to every week with alpha patches.
[2:34:34] Truthseeker96: because you wanna make sure its good
[2:34:35] Truthseeker96: lol
[2:34:37] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Because you want to make the game better
[2:34:38] LeGoogs: 4Head
[2:34:46] danielthegathering: is this your first rogue ever?
[2:34:48] Sovanos: @Towelliee You can't go back to retail you haven't done fishing or cooking yet ....somebody has to test it if not you then who
[2:34:50] Wolfenhoof: Because Tauren Rogue Kappa
[2:34:51] mulletrocker11358: why am i playing wrath beta when i have already done it? cuz its fun :)
[2:34:51] Bertinelle: why wouldnt you test a game for free that you are interested in playing
[2:34:55] Moooogly: @corupted812 i see dat.   main ww here
[2:35:00] elandura: @hakaeltn if you're looking at everything as transaction, that's how you would think.
[2:35:01] Attackroot: kinda like early access game that u can buy into. it needs testers to test
[2:35:07] Oswanov: It's not like you need to test it 9-5, in thorough detail lol
[2:35:23] Rudric_Ice: so does dracthyr feel more powerful in AOE or single target DPS ?
[2:36:01] thatoneguynobodylikes352: have you tried interacting with things while riding a normal mount?
[2:36:19] Attackroot: ya sad thing is a streamer friend of mine that hasnt played wow since the start of bfa got in alpha. logged in made the new race and it back to other games lol
[2:36:21] jpopei: Hello boys! I would love to buy a 3090 GPU for streaming/gaming.Is there any you guys recommend buying?Sorry for the irrelevant question
[2:36:25] stumper1231: taurens can be rogues?
[2:36:28] Truthseeker96: the event isn't even that good to be fair
[2:36:31] superluboss: DI is dead on twitch
[2:36:57] Funderik: the mindset that alpha is for streamers content only is fucked.
[2:37:07] SteveOwloki: New World still in your Rotation?
[2:37:08] Maldfatugly: @jpopei buy 2nd hand or wait for 4070
[2:37:09] Sovanos: you spec change to outlaw and you hook
[2:37:13] Truthseeker96: most twitch viewers are on pc so it makes sense that mobile games don't last long. we all play pc games lol
[2:37:23] mulletrocker11358: thats a big fucking rogue lol
[2:37:27] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad

[2:37:46] snuffles_80: wait? a rogue teuren?
[2:37:46] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[2:37:47] dranet11: TFT is on mobile, that's usually 60k+
[2:37:47] Norbuc: Hello
[2:37:48] Wolfenhoof: @superluboss I think it gets old quick to see some poor shit throwing money at the screen^^
[2:37:55] D3m0nHunt3r666: putuTumuu putuTumuu putuTumuu putuTumuu
[2:38:08] danielthegathering: can you not mount?
[2:38:10] stumper1231: Blizzard started using alpha as sort of advertisement thats why its streamer only content
[2:38:17] crespian: what time is it for Towelliee right now?
[2:38:23] crespian: 4am ?
[2:38:23] SteveOwloki: Good to Hear...i spent a cpl of months at launch...always come back to wow

[2:39:33] Limpickles: alacrity -> deeper stratagem
[2:39:35] shalfey4: How do you like new talent trees?
[2:39:41] Limpickles: deeper strat is sooo good for assa
[2:39:44] swampt1l: Azure is the 3rd zone right?
[2:39:44] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[2:40:08] stumper1231: loll they tried to immitate Path of exile with the talent trees
[2:40:10] Moooogly: @Towelliee If you go outlaw you can get deeper strategem twice.
[2:40:12] Genuinearctic: @xsilentghost totally agree, been wanting it back for years
[2:40:23] shalfey4: Thisle Tea used to be crafted by cooking lol :)
[2:40:24] tronbadgames: @Towelliee echoing rep, center trees
[2:40:33] hotdogobathroom: @stumper1231 not even close?
[2:40:35] Truthseeker96: yeah that will be op with cold blood
[2:40:37] Sovanos: It doesn't scale with combo points
[2:40:42] Limpickles: yeah 6 combo point envenoms are BIG BOY envenoms
[2:40:49] Sovanos: EP is pepesadge
[2:40:55] Truthseeker96: 100% crit on increased effect on finishers with an extra combo point
[2:40:56] tronbadgames: @Towelliee
[2:40:57] Truthseeker96: op
[2:41:15] Truthseeker96: feel the powwa!
[2:41:21] swampt1l: is that echoing rep the kyrian abilty right now?
[2:41:34] Sovanos: shoudl drop DP and try shadowdance if it implemented
[2:41:48] danielthegathering: doesnt stack tho
[2:41:53] lloydbates: so one can change talents in resting areas? are the tomes to do this everywhere?
[2:41:54] belicaldron: A tauren rogue is still hilarious to me...I don't think I have ever been snuck up to by a cow. Could you imagine tauren rogues at Pamploma ? LOL
[2:41:54] Rudric_Ice: can a dracthyr go into torghast ?
[2:41:59] lithium364: you should try outlaw and abuse the bug with the constant 300% pistol damage
[2:42:00] swampt1l: have you tried Sub?
[2:42:03] Sovanos: The problem with DP the current talent ingame gives you 5% more dmg per combo point but the talent tree oens don't have that
[2:42:21] magicclicker: LUL
[2:42:24] Zettabyte: Good morrning towHAMUP
[2:42:29] NinjaChane: especially when they start moving things around in the tree
[2:42:29] shalfey4: hehe that's kind true
[2:42:31] stumper1231: need more adderal
[2:42:35] belicaldron: Concur about the boomer issue...this game used to be easier
[2:42:39] Sledgecore: I guess you're not a PoE player?
[2:42:41] Genuinearctic: Night time as it should look, not only a darkened skye. Or have to use a potion to turn it into night
[2:42:47] The_Tacozilla: yea i have had my talents reset several times on my rogue lol
[2:42:51] KaisenSiru: Valeera in the background PrideGasp
[2:42:52] Nevindaz: D:

[2:42:57] Sledgecore: KEKW
[2:43:01] Truthseeker96: i kinda like it, you can change how your class/spec fundamentally works for any given content you're farming
[2:43:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: PoE LUL
[2:43:05] Truthseeker96: its cool ig
[2:43:08] Nevindaz: poe is the best arpg
[2:43:12] bukka_hot: it will get easier to remmeber and 'swim' in it as we play I am sure
[2:43:18] Rudric_Ice: Taurens can be mages now too
[2:43:26] Saxuzo: You gonna print that screenshot out?
[2:43:30] zysmos: played poe for 5 hours and uninstalled it too noob unfriendly
[2:43:53] Oswanov: Yeah, PoE is really good but not new player friendly at all, and they are making it worse
[2:43:56] Sovanos: Outlaw + hook
[2:43:59] Limpickles: you'll live
[2:44:02] TixesDT: just jump you are rogue
[2:44:03] Limpickles: rogues take half fall damage
[2:44:04] belicaldron: dragonflight
[2:44:06] Limpickles: so you'll be fine
[2:44:06] wTFologie: Ur a rogue, just jump
[2:44:06] BayBeeBroBear: your rogue
[2:44:07] Oswanov: Asmon backed it in Beta
[2:44:10] Artiiz: Asmon has been playing it for years
[2:44:11] hawkinz85: shadowstep
[2:44:23] tronbadgames: hook or shadowstep
[2:44:23] NinjaChane: rogue takes half fall damage
[2:44:27] metavahn231: torch what?
[2:44:27] Sovanos: Switch to outlaw + hook the ground
[2:44:28] Nerojin91: How you finding Dragonflight so far? I play Classic but thinking of coming back to Retail
[2:44:34] YMonsterszn: U HAVE THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD
[2:44:36] Truthseeker96: that was close lol
[2:44:40] FatChase: Pog
[2:44:40] danielthegathering: yes
[2:44:42] Nevindaz: yea ofc.. but if you follow a build from start and or even if you dont if you learn how stats and talent tree work in the game you can build a strong build
[2:44:46] belicaldron: I played since vanilla and was constantly learning stuff...
[2:44:48] Artiiz: always worked like that
[2:44:54] stumper1231: shadowstep just teleports behind
[2:44:59] Artiiz: As long as they're not hostile
[2:45:01] Cynicalbadger: @Towelliee you can shadowstep friendly targets as well.
[2:45:02] shalfey4: My boomer brain can't even handle Tauren Rogues lol
[2:45:04] belicaldron: no tutorial at all at the beginning
[2:45:22] ashwing_: Ebyssian? He can leave Highmountain now?
[2:45:31] tronbadgames: non dracthyr quest?
[2:45:33] kone_malone: How goes alpha? Feeling like a step in the right direction?!
[2:45:34] thepaladinjournal: yes he can leave
[2:45:37] The_Tacozilla: the intro quest is playable but when you get on the ship to the dragon isle it boots you back to org
[2:45:41] szble: ebyssian horde and wrathion alliance ambassadors
[2:45:48] Sovanos: if you stealth and shadowstep you won't aggro
[2:45:57] BayBeeBroBear: Love you all
[2:46:24] DemodiusTV: eh... 3 weeks into season i clesred all t16 etcv
[2:46:34] DemodiusTV: poe doesnt take much dedication
[2:46:35] Rudric_Ice: they still didnt release warr and pally talent trees Pepehand
[2:46:39] quentinkil: hi how are you
[2:46:41] DemodiusTV: D2 takes longer
[2:46:45] Jawis: from what I've seen during the last days watching you play the Alpha it feels like the most polished test ever, ngl I like how things are going
[2:46:45] shalfey4: Are you going to play Diablo IV?
[2:46:55] bukka_hot: LUL
[2:46:56] Nevindaz: if you know some tricks you can make a build well fast but yea at the beginnning you need to learn how the game works
[2:46:57] Mojohusk: LUL
[2:46:58] Oswanov: Yep, the rares this league were changed
[2:46:58] Truthseeker96: oof lol
[2:46:58] Nevindaz: KEKW
[2:47:02] Fedura: sentinel was super overtuned at the start
[2:47:06] zysmos: also characters are short-lived next season you just throw it to the trash
[2:47:07] beernear31: KEKW well idk about that
[2:47:08] Fedura: got better as season went on lmaoo
[2:47:12] Nevindaz: that's why they have pob
[2:47:20] Rudric_Ice: i played POE for 3hrs and uninstalled it too many damn item drops
[2:47:24] BayBeeBroBear: naw when they started doing resets same time as d2, and made me choose
[2:47:42] metavahn231: you can tell they split their small team up for poe2
[2:47:43] Nevindaz: @Rudric_Ice you need the neversink filter
[2:47:48] bukka_hot: @Rudric_Ice  there loot filters I wouldnt pass on that game too quick
[2:47:53] Architip: look like the new race with rouge will be op with 2 base class stuns
[2:48:02] beernear31: blight
[2:48:04] Oswanov: Blight
[2:48:12] Shatraugh: Blight
[2:48:12] cabalish: morning all

[2:48:26] thepaladinjournal: @Architip dracthyr can only be evokers and evokers can only be dracthyr
[2:48:32] beernear31: cast on crit lol
[2:48:33] Oswanov: They made the game harder over time, u used to be able to do w/e u want and play
[2:48:38] Rudric_Ice: then theres that GIGA ASS talent
[2:48:42] Oswanov: nowadays, you gotta adhere to the meta more
[2:48:46] Rudric_Ice: builds
[2:49:09] Architip: @vorianloken ohhh thanks
[2:49:14] Ninwa: This song has so much nostalgia and good feelings

[2:49:51] BayBeeBroBear: No matter what state wow in, still best, you just get burnt out, like with anything
[2:49:56] thepaladinjournal: @Architip his tauren form name was ebonhorn, his draconic name is ebyssian
[2:50:01] Jawis: @SmFoxx well yeah, can't say anything about that, but I feel like the other Alphas so far were actually way more bugged - but you're probably right
[2:50:11] KaisenSiru: Cataclysm Pog

[2:50:40] TheCliffyShow: Ebonhorn!
[2:50:49] LearnedSomething: I guess he told you then
[2:50:56] Rudric_Ice: Feels stupid that dragons can use any race as their visage form and dracthyrs are stuck with shitty blood elves and human females
[2:51:03] Slayvoff: i was thinking about making a holy paladin, but how do healers even do solo torghast and other activities that are damage intensive?
[2:51:08] snuffles_80: best thing blizz done for the last several years was to make it impossible to mount on key NPcs
[2:51:18] TheCliffyShow: Something tells me the other dragons trust Ebonhorn a lot more then Wraithion.
[2:51:47] szble: wrathion is young
[2:51:54] Nicoz971: he does come a lot as he pleases
[2:52:02] snake_like: Wrathion's written as a savior-complex dumbass lol
[2:52:04] Keirmot: Wrathion also murders a bunch of Dragon, while Ebyon doesn't
[2:52:04] Torkelnder: they racist against the dragonboys
[2:52:14] CommanderKrano: Wrathion almost fucked up all of azeroth with bringing in the iron horde. why whould _anyone_ trust him LuL
[2:52:21] ShadoodHD: young and cured from corruption soo...
[2:52:26] Lilyofthemyst: He is unpredictable, so I don’t think many trust him
[2:52:29] swampt1l: Wrathion is gonna be in dragonflight watch LUL
[2:52:30] NewWorldReign: Isnt Wrathion in charge of the Black Dragonflight?
[2:52:32] ErosnPsyche: elon musk is on twitch giving away bitcoin and eth KEKW
[2:52:36] Nicoz971: he has other motivation
[2:52:51] TheCliffyShow: Ebonhorn would be such a better leader of the black dragons. I just don't think he wants to do it.

[2:55:29] Klutar: uldaman remake? nice
[2:55:29] ShadoodHD: lost dwarves... must be the trio based on blizzards arcade game
[2:55:37] The_Tacozilla: Emberthal has a weird looking jaw when compared to other drakthyr, unless they fixed it
[2:55:39] KaisenSiru: Khadgar Pog
[2:56:00] Funderik: if they revamped a bunch of classic dungeons to make them into content for DF it might bring some classic andrews ti DF for a try.
[2:56:10] Whoz: monkaS
[2:56:11] szble: oh thats a dracthyr npc
[2:56:14] LeGoogs: S
[2:56:15] Shatraugh: We will be slaves after all
[2:56:20] snake_like: MK ULTRA v. WoW
[2:56:21] redrebelr: su-per

[2:56:25] SirSquaggles: monkaW
[2:56:42] Crakila: S
[2:56:42] TheCliffyShow: Now whenever Towelliee sees the letter S he will murder someone.
[2:56:44] redrebelr: xD
[2:56:46] Akermay: The hypnotism isn’t working. He saying the same stuff as always LUL
[2:56:46] Nevindaz: I rlly want to see if Medivh will return or send some whispers to Khadgar .. bcuse in upper karazhan at the end he sayed something ..
[2:56:47] ohprawinspree: could you show us the raid in the journal??
[2:56:48] backstreetalright: Im adicted to tha game
[2:56:52] S4INTIV: SMOrc Clap
[2:56:53] Scraggersmeh: @Funderik Nah. Classic Andys won't come to retail. They'd be incapable of functioning in the game. The skill gap between one button rotation classic and retail is just a canyon.
[2:57:20] Nevindaz: I rlly want to see if Medivh will return or send some whispers to Khadgar .. bcuse in upper karazhan at the end he sayed something ....
[2:57:30] ShadoodHD: i think its to get ready for the next phase
[2:57:35] The_Tacozilla: yea the zepp does appear
[2:57:36] Krelivane_: Not yet implemented
[2:57:40] Funderik: @Funderik that's partly true, however some will come try it, because they only have raid log content.
[2:57:40] Ninwa: It does but when you get to the island you get ported
[2:57:41] metavahn231: classic players dont want the convineince and ease of retail
[2:57:42] Bogzeh: looks like a prepatch quest
[2:57:42] mewkittymon: He might be a new toon experience?
[2:57:43] Akermay: Org docks are so sad. When is that getting an upgrade I say
[2:57:43] ShadoodHD: meaning we're not supposed to get it yet but why not do it Kappa
[2:57:44] The_Tacozilla: but youll get booted back to org eventually
[2:57:50] Nicoz971: honestly a dragon should taker you there
[2:57:50] elandura: I got alpha 2 days ago, for me this questline was always there.
[2:57:56] szble: that porter guy also tweeted more stuff about the dracthyr lore
[2:57:56] PadidinJones: oh no its just like the zepp into the cata area
[2:58:02] Norbi33: this thing feels like twilight hightlands quest chain :D
[2:58:03] NinjaChane: when they flip the switch
[2:58:06] Wcvechten: uldaman is prob the prepatch part
[2:58:08] swampt1l: cant wait for servers to crash
[2:58:12] Nevindaz: and it will be account wide?
[2:58:20] ohprawinspree: could you show us the raid in the journal??
[2:58:28] Nicoz971: so this xpac we get dragon riding, next xpac is a watery one and we will get surfing
[2:58:32] The_Tacozilla: the zepp is like the one we used to go to pandaria
[2:58:33] elandura: that zeplin gets you right back to orgrimmar, I tried, unless they fixed it.
[2:58:50] Scoodles91: Org will be lagging like hell on the big servers
[2:58:54] wTFologie: This music slaps
[2:58:55] Wcvechten: that's  new
[2:58:58] Nicoz971: that's a cannoneer
[2:59:00] Whoz: veiRave
[2:59:00] ShadoodHD: oh.... we going big huh
[2:59:01] cobwebhotdog: Thicc
[2:59:12] Two_Headed_Raven: Upgrades! :=
[2:59:20] Dantte169: Thats a big zepellin KEKW
[2:59:23] SmFoxx: @Jawis ya, I dropped again back with HoA... just never missed it.  Try to keep an eye out just in case for some friends that are diehard, but just not there for me; each their own
[2:59:28] ShadoodHD: let's get a rave going in there at release POGGERS
[2:59:31] NinjaChane: that's going to fun at launch
[2:59:41] PadidinJones: I would get off your mount if I were you
[2:59:58] Fearrless: name of the zepellin i guess
[3:00:15] TheCliffyShow: The Horde decided their zeppelins needed more metal and pointy bits. Those guys really overcompensate.
[3:00:18] WrongStaff: What ui do you use just wondering like it
[3:00:22] Nicoz971: KEKW
[3:00:31] Scraggersmeh: Got to realm swap to a dead realm for first week so you can guarantee play the game, then transfer back to your main realm for raid week.
[3:00:52] Nicoz971: I'll join your layer, will be chill af
[3:00:58] backstreetalright: What a banger of a game finally it’s back
[3:01:09] PadidinJones: lmao
[3:01:25] FrankTheTank1988: @WrongStaff if you mean current on screen ui, thats the default ui Minus unit frames not yet implemented, you can see kinda what they want for player frame on the wow yt channel under talents & user interface DF reveal. ;)

[3:03:20] zellyree: just jump around with the hunter eye thingy ez explore Pog
[3:03:21] PadidinJones: Im hoping that Wrath will have a booster
[3:03:22] Akermay: Odds of a new player going to mists that they haven’t seen before thinking it’s the new zone? :D
[3:03:31] denflup: can we expect a november or december release? @Towelliee
[3:03:32] BigG_SA: or take 2 weeks for both wrath and df LUL
[3:03:33] your_sister_2499: I have to convince my boyfriend to let me play wow again lmfao I’m jealous of all you single normal relationships ;-;.

[3:04:03] Gr3atAp3: Ulduar > all other raids
[3:04:06] Aliaz_the_Mage: @dolegowski0402 He sounds toxic
[3:04:17] headshot_hunter6: i hope wrath pre patch isnt next week but week after to give me a chance to actually hit max level before it drops
[3:04:32] metavahn231: wotlk leveling is so easy
[3:04:37] SirSquaggles: Diablo tattoo?
[3:04:39] 3663Sharad: What? Tattoo event? POGGERS
[3:04:49] backstreetalright: Ppl cant understand DF is classic on steroids
[3:04:49] Scraggersmeh: @headshot_hunter6 How is 58-70 taking you more than 3-4 days?
[3:04:51] NinjaChane: that's awesome
[3:04:59] NinjaChane: hell yeah
[3:05:25] your_sister_2499: Yeah I’m like prepping a speech for him to let me play because. Can’t play with people who are dudes like I need to ask them if they are a male and then I can’t play with them  or join a guild with just him in it because he has issues >.> you don’t knowww lol

[3:06:22] your_sister_2499: I just need to join a all female guild lol I know I know
[3:06:34] Aliaz_the_Mage: @dolegowski0402 RElationships are complecated, but that sounds like a him problem. Not something you should be suffering under. He needs to work on that
[3:06:34] headshot_hunter6: @Scraggersmeh im 40 right now

[3:11:36] sinjordan: Did you watch the new  Resident Evil on Netflix? @Towelliee  its not bad!
[3:11:51] arkad1212: @Towelliee the new primalist paladin set from dragonflight looks alot shittier the the concept art it's up on wowhead btw

[3:12:31] stateofdreamers: i haven't played my rogue in so long, this is making me want to relearn it again
[3:12:35] Helios_a: its pretty bad KEKWlaugh
[3:12:36] your_sister_2499: I def wanna okay pre-patch leading into this >< betting pre patch comes out nov
[3:12:42] backstreetalright: All i know is DF is it im telling everyone i know and don’t know

[3:13:29] king_julian_96: any dungeonss available yet towelliee
[3:13:30] sourdieselogz: cool
[3:13:30] Helios_a: thats about when I quit, the t3 grind was too much for me
[3:13:37] swampt1l: towelliee is only playing wow atm
[3:13:37] stateofdreamers: i feel so sorry for my characters on lost ark and new world that haven't been touched in months
[3:13:44] stateofdreamers: it's too much trying to play them all
[3:13:45] MeisterPetze: thats why i dont play any other games then wow
[3:13:46] your_sister_2499: I think it will be a nice refresher, I don’t know if it’s It but it’s a good start for change back to wows old ways with a new updated model
[3:14:05] sinjordan: New World just was never it for me
[3:14:05] sourdieselogz: @stateofdreamers send me all mats/gold plz
[3:14:09] chasmone: New world was really fun in the beginning, and then it just died out
[3:14:14] stateofdreamers: ahaha
[3:14:20] stateofdreamers: maybe i'll have to give new world a go again
[3:14:44] stateofdreamers: yeah 100%
[3:14:55] vladtepes490: prof where a nightmare to level
[3:14:56] Vobic13: i just want Greatswords in new world and that is hopefully soon
[3:15:00] backstreetalright: Hey you wanna know new people ( friendship based only) get on DF
[3:15:00] vladtepes490: its was insane in new world
[3:15:11] your_sister_2499: Shadowlands was way too advanced for the type of content wow is lmfao. They needed to go back to lich king days. That’s all the game needed for a refresher. One of their issues was every expansion they changed the talent trees so much. Instead of balancing >.>
[3:15:17] Genilort: I think people are literally just going to fly around azeroth with dragon fly
[3:15:21] chasmone: I hope they add more class talent trees come tuesday to alpha
[3:15:30] swampt1l: too advanced?
[3:15:48] Satamapiiri: whats new in wow?
[3:15:56] Helios_a: New world release was soooo good

[3:16:16] Skorb: The only grind I dislike is gathering materials.
[3:16:22] vladtepes490: having dungeons locked behind the keys where a terrible idea the way dungeon worked in new world
[3:16:30] Torjix: In 1267 hours I got my expertise to max and all profesions/ harvest to max and weppon skills
[3:16:30] vladtepes490: thus is why they got rid of them lol
[3:16:38] Shehias: Towelliee, I would like to apologize. I told to Sloot that he needs a brown man in the conversations, but I forgot that you are well and thoroughly a brown man. As a fellow brown man, rep us well homie. Love ya fella keep it rockin <3
[3:17:05] nodz_n: so in new xpac is there some new system like covenants/ artifacts etc?
[3:17:47] your_sister_2499: So, what they need to do is make it so if I make a alt the only thing I need to do is lvl it and gear it. I don’t wanna do some BS again  unless it’s professions which makes sense
[3:17:51] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @towelliee hey are you going to make a Tauren Mage as well?
[3:17:57] sethret: how many hours
[3:17:58] NinjaChane: new world launch was super fun
[3:18:01] vladtepes490: I have about the same amount of time played and got no where near all prof maxed, I had may 4 or so @Torjix
[3:18:10] Scoodles91: anything above 100 is money well spend
[3:18:12] vladtepes490: them where a pain
[3:18:15] vladtepes490: they*
[3:18:41] PadidinJones: @Towelliee so all classes will be available for all races now? Like I can make an orc pally or is it just rogue?
[3:18:45] hyboric: tauren warlock?
[3:18:46] your_sister_2499: New world is nice to go back to for holiday stuff but it really died down for me.
[3:18:48] TheCliffyShow: If a Tauren mage needs to regain mana, does it just drank it's own milk?
[3:18:49] Shehias: Feelsbadman.Love you all, have a wonderful night/morning <3
[3:18:53] backstreetalright: Yeah but we can all agree the mojo from wow is insane,NW is no lore game ykwim
[3:19:06] chasmone: Shit. I mean you pay over $20 to go see a 2 hour movie in theaters LUL
[3:19:08] Munz13: @PadidinJones they made hunters rogues and priests available for every race
[3:19:10] redbulladin: are you enjoying playing rogue tow?
[3:19:12] vladtepes490: I mean I have no regrets playing and if they did a major patch or x pac I would check it out
[3:19:26] vladtepes490: yeah the x mas event was good
[3:19:26] Torjix: @vladtepes490 I got my profession at the beginning up when the XP was much better then now on some proffesions
[3:19:31] zsombee19: Oh yeah. That christmas event was very cool. I liked it a lot
[3:19:41] swampt1l: have you tried sub towel?
[3:19:46] vladtepes490: ahhh gotcha @Torjix
[3:19:54] Fluisterwoud: Only class i can't be arse d to level, rogue.
[3:19:58] redbulladin: dont worry outlaw is one of the eaier class
[3:19:59] vladtepes490: Outlaw looks SO strong so far from the tree
[3:20:20] TheCliffyShow: If a Tauren mage needs to regain mana, does it just drink it's own milk? Or maybe that's where it's conjured food comes from.
[3:20:29] kmalih: Can’t wait to see prot pala gameplay
[3:20:32] swampt1l: Sub is probably harder then the other 2
[3:20:38] Colt_Engineer: with outlaw don't just get outlawed?
[3:20:46] vladtepes490: it def is @zeuussss_
[3:20:53] your_sister_2499: One thing games lack that wow will always have is the feeling of when you go into SW and wish Anduin died instead of Varian >.> it’s ok. I’ll always come back
[3:20:54] karter2811: love that wow have gone from defeating titans, killing gods, going to the after life, killing death and now back to killing gnolls
[3:20:58] cakeslolz: @towelliee new world created a crazy experience for launch with all the early world pvp. Being there at launch was amazing
[3:21:07] Klutar: jumped on the wotlk beta and forgot how annoying it is combo points don't stack on you lol
[3:21:07] Fluisterwoud: Gorilla
[3:21:37] TheCliffyShow: Hyena dudes.

[3:21:40] Nightcraft_op: Trogs
[3:21:47] infernant: Thought id be disgusted by the cow rogue.... but playing an orc feels similar so.... eeeh i guess
[3:21:47] kreff_: Same for feral :(
[3:21:52] PadidinJones: @Towelliee you see Hoggers new model?
[3:22:01] vladtepes490: yeah they are a blast @zeuussss_
[3:22:05] Torjix: yep gold dupe and items was so bad
[3:22:13] cakeslolz: The journey at launch was well worth the money
[3:22:20] Shehias: Just wanted to mention that I live 30m away from you and I'm tryna get banned rn so pls recognize me life is p rough fam <3
[3:22:25] Satamapiiri: haven't played wow since 2015
[3:22:27] TheCliffyShow: They should have chose the brown model for Hogger.
[3:22:28] PadidinJones: me neither. he got the generic model now
[3:22:33] swampt1l: mained hunter since end of bfa and got ksm for the firs ttime this season,was hella happy @vladtepes490

[3:22:56] TheCliffyShow: Only spec that doesn't use daggers is Outlaw.
[3:22:59] Avatarblade: yes
[3:23:02] your_sister_2499: Alpha looks pretty nice so far I didn’t think they would have all zones completed tbh. I really want to main envoker healer I think if they increased their healing range they might be too op though lol
[3:23:04] vladtepes490: you would prolly wanna use a dagger in your off hand tho for energy regen
[3:23:04] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:23:04] Avatarblade: take axe
[3:23:10] zerodigital: yeah get the axe for outlaw
[3:23:19] thatoneguynobodylikes352: Does mutilate still say it needs daggers ? it's not in the tooltip on wowhead
[3:23:21] Avatarblade: can OH dagger on outlaw
[3:23:22] ohprawinspree: could you show us the raid in the journal??
[3:23:28] Shehias: Man... being here since pandaria doesn't mean shit I guess unless you were subbed lol
[3:23:46] swampt1l: whats the main city in DF?
[3:23:48] antori_92: is there a lvl cap atm on  alpha?
[3:24:01] your_sister_2499: 65 I think?
[3:24:03] Oswanov: Valdrakken? I think
[3:24:09] bukka_hot: Dalaran POGGERS
[3:24:15] swampt1l: ahhh thank you
[3:24:19] TheCliffyShow: San Drago
[3:24:25] vladtepes490: the fact you can snag expose weakness with shadow dance is gonna make outlaw hit like a truck
[3:24:37] your_sister_2499: That dragon mount run is awful lol
[3:24:58] TheCliffyShow: Keep Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'!
[3:25:05] Atticus_de: greetings from germany...nice stream!!
[3:25:05] Truthseeker96: nice
[3:25:19] KaisenSiru: Pog UI redesign
[3:25:24] karl_mythic: Agreed, that drake run is terrible. Hopefully it's fixed.
[3:25:25] ohprawinspree: yes
[3:25:29] zerodigital: in your face
[3:25:29] elandura: ambush
[3:25:31] Gutroan: Do you have player nameplates now?
[3:25:32] Truthseeker96: pistol shot has a multiplier i think so only use it when it procs
[3:25:32] TheCliffyShow: More in your face
[3:25:37] ohprawinspree: both tbh
[3:25:41] Keirmot: Outlaw is Warrior with stealth XD
[3:25:44] Dherjee: @Towelliee they  have a talent that makes ambush very good, which in turn makes shadow dance good
[3:25:46] Klutar: mostly dont need stealth, can open with ambush tho
[3:25:49] your_sister_2499: Yeah the drake looks like it’s slipping on some invisible butter 😂
[3:25:49] ohprawinspree: depends on talents
[3:25:51] NoSkillNoCash: is this a Tauren Rogue?
[3:26:01] TheCliffyShow: @Keirmot And, better style.
[3:26:07] elandura: sap etc
[3:26:13] NA_Mus: @BR0KEJ0SH yea
[3:26:17] vladtepes490: the way it seems to play is you wanna try to do as much damage in shadow dance windows because you have amps from the tree you can snag while stealth
[3:26:22] wulfsr3ign: wulfsr3ign subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[3:26:22] deathknightmode: sheap shot
[3:26:43] karl_mythic: Hopefully streamers are actually beta testing the game and not just milking views.
[3:26:46] vladtepes490: from the outside looking in that is
[3:26:52] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Towelliee  Thank you as always for streaming man.
[3:27:05] dephius: how do you feel about the crafting system?
[3:27:13] Knaxxis: lol what fuck are they streaming then for ?
[3:27:18] Skibberz: whats up
[3:27:23] Browniepoint: @karl_mythic how can they beta test during an alpha??
[3:27:23] vladtepes490: everything is going to change anyways, so you gotta take all this with a big grain of salt
[3:27:27] Knaxxis: of course for views and content its a job
[3:27:40] Nevindaz: is the sword still in Silithus? towCringe
[3:27:43] Knaxxis: and they love the game
[3:27:47] your_sister_2499: Oh I bet people are playing it to play it but I’m sure most are reporting issues at the same time lol I’m glad they can do both so when we can play it’s polished 😂
[3:28:04] your_sister_2499: When *
[3:28:04] TheCliffyShow: I want into beta just so I can miss with Dracthyr and dragonriding customization. If WoWhead adds that shit to the dressing room, I'm good.
[3:28:05] alcari_oce: oh the race / class combos are unlocked, can gnomes be more?
[3:28:23] backstreetalright: Hey streaming is a job buddy no problem with view gathering as with herb gathering
[3:28:25] Aliaz_the_Mage: dagger OH is fine
[3:28:35] wildwittra: ohh. big bag is part of the base game now !
[3:28:38] nicolai_original: I think u can dagger OH
[3:28:39] ohprawinspree: put axe in main and dagger in off hand, makes ur attacks quicker
[3:28:41] nicolai_original: but could be wrong
[3:28:47] bashinhead: Will they bring coins back since there will be master loot in raids?
[3:28:50] vladtepes490: you prolly wanna use a dagger in your off hand because there is a talent that gives your off hand generate 75 energy
[3:28:54] bukka_hot: what sword
[3:29:01] TheCliffyShow: Some sites say, a dagger in off-hand is better.
[3:29:08] KaisenSiru: RPGEpicSword
[3:29:24] ohprawinspree: ye
[3:29:25] Avatarblade: ye, it's for main gauche
[3:29:27] vladtepes490: yeah
[3:29:28] danielthegathering: fast offhand is better yes for poison application
[3:29:35] Avatarblade: and poisons
[3:29:49] TheCliffyShow: Of course, that is for Shadowlands.
[3:29:56] Klutar: it's your spender
[3:29:59] Klutar: like envenom
[3:29:59] vladtepes490: its not
[3:30:04] Avatarblade: dispatch is outlaw main finisher
[3:30:08] Skibberz: for outlaw its one of teh main combo burning moves
[3:30:42] thatoneguynobodylikes352: rogues and noobs have one thing in common. they pick locks
[3:30:42] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[3:30:44] Skibberz: wait we can be tar rouge?
[3:30:50] your_sister_2499: I haven’t see a lot of complaints with the new talents for classes besides holy priest so that’s  nice so far
[3:30:57] Avatarblade: ye rogue can be any race now
[3:31:02] szble: like the vancleef
[3:31:05] Akermay: I thought the class tree remains the same?
[3:31:09] vladtepes490: They did a good break down of the tree
[3:31:13] vladtepes490: it was a good video
[3:31:16] Aphro_Samurai: @Towelliee is that Edwin Vancleef on the right? thats pretty dope
[3:31:36] Sovanos: no
[3:31:37] Darkterror141: no
[3:31:39] vladtepes490: nopr
[3:31:41] Darkterror141: was only assa
[3:31:49] daxirr1: can't get evasion without it can you
[3:32:02] TheCliffyShow: They went with Edward VanCleef instead of his hotter and more popular daughter?
[3:32:20] Sovanos: shadowdance = ambush/dispatch from steatlh=  more rolls  = better play
[3:32:51] NoSkillNoCash: everyone gets recuperate?!?!
[3:32:57] NoSkillNoCash: thats so dope
[3:33:24] ialwaysforget7: Morning  Chat!
[3:33:42] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee What about the starting zones, are they still there?
[3:34:03] R0seblue: hey, what role do you recommend for a new player that wants to start doing m+?!
[3:34:26] processor94: @R0seblue dps for sure
[3:34:26] TheCliffyShow: @R0seblue DPS
[3:34:29] Odd__Thomas: im just waiting for the expansion to return i just finished up season 3 and s4 isnt something i wanna do. kinda a waiting game at this point
[3:34:31] wildwittra: choosing a new active talent should play the sound linked to that ability
[3:34:31] Macrodotz: @r0seblue demon hunter is ez
[3:34:33] NewWorldReign: do you have sap? Or is that another talent skill?
[3:34:36] your_sister_2499: If they do a new zone every week aloha should be done maybe by early September?
[3:34:37] Klutar: hahah
[3:34:50] NoSkillNoCash: shadowdance is base rogue, wow
[3:35:06] BetterHalfGaming: I dont feel the feral tree either
[3:35:07] Avatarblade: ye forced to take garrote into outlaw which you'd never use
[3:35:10] Odd__Thomas: yeah  i can see this changing a lot later on due to feed abck
[3:35:12] Odd__Thomas: back*
[3:35:13] TheCliffyShow: Could use some rearranging.
[3:35:15] your_sister_2499: Oh no I jinxed it now dislike is priest and rogue
[3:35:18] KaisenSiru: Rogue Pog
[3:35:24] Klutar: yeh old core abilities as talents is still super weird to me
[3:35:39] king_julian_96: any dungeons available yet toweliee on the alpha
[3:35:41] love_eggplant: how is shadow dance that low if its core spell for subtlety?
[3:35:42] vladtepes490: prolly not
[3:35:49] Avatarblade: probably won't even have it on the bars
[3:35:49] bazziiiTV: do rogues dont have "choose only one" talents? am i seeing that right?
[3:35:51] Odd__Thomas: core abilitys shouldnt be a damn talent imo
[3:36:10] MammothGB: Feel like rogue just needs a few more diagonal connectors to feel less restrictive
[3:36:11] Odd__Thomas: like hey "anyone have a interrupt spec
[3:36:12] TheCliffyShow: I wish cheat death wasn't so low.
[3:36:16] lithium364: @Towelliee right side last talent in outlaw tree is bugged and permanent active if you pull the "passive" in your bar you can click it to have it active
[3:36:18] Klutar: yeh use use pistol shot when that procs
[3:36:21] Avatarblade: @danhamttv ye, so far at least, rogue is the only class without a choose talent
[3:36:22] NoSkillNoCash: costs half the energy
[3:36:23] Vahs_Redclaw: that was a BFA azerite pretty sure
[3:36:28] yungbeaner28: yea 20 energy
[3:36:28] Truthseeker96: yea
[3:36:32] redbulladin: yes
[3:36:32] Odd__Thomas: yeah
[3:36:34] danielthegathering: yep
[3:36:35] ialwaysforget7: In the  whole scale of wow as a whole would you  consider Dragonflight  as maybe a soft launch in a right direction for blizz?
[3:36:35] Klutar: should ye
[3:36:38] Coriollis: half cost of combo would be too much xD
[3:36:40] vladtepes490: yeah
[3:36:44] Klutar: cleave damage
[3:36:47] Klutar: blade flurry
[3:36:48] Odd__Thomas: very nice for aoe more for like mythic+
[3:36:52] BLACKFOOT_TN: So they are forcing you to take useless or not fun talents in order to get to stuff you want below them. Or putting juicy talents down a tree side opposite of other talents you would want?
[3:37:01] Aphro_Samurai: youll see a double slash animation. instead of one and an icon will come up
[3:37:05] Odd__Thomas: burst pretty much
[3:37:05] TheCliffyShow: Blade Flurry is an outlaw rogues only way to cleave.
[3:37:10] Truthseeker96: yup
[3:37:21] your_sister_2499: To be honest they should do pre patch Early Nov - December and launch ins January
[3:37:23] Klutar: buffs it
[3:37:27] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[3:37:35] danielthegathering: tank rogue
[3:37:36] danielthegathering: lets go
[3:38:02] NoSkillNoCash: DansGame
[3:38:03] Truthseeker96: have to take it yup
[3:38:18] Odd__Thomas: tbh, most skills u wont use like most talent trees use to be its just a skill point just to reach what u really need
[3:38:18] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW Editable UI System - DRAGONFLIGHT ALPHA EXCLUSIVE youtu.be/jst2FvVYB00
[3:38:19] Rayao: wasn't it the same back in the classic days? you had to take some meh shit to get further down the tree
[3:38:32] Truthseeker96: you can use it twice ina row
[3:38:38] beernear31: bruh what is the actual rotation going to be KEKW
[3:38:40] Truthseeker96: first one with max points then second with w.e it gives you
[3:38:51] Bogzeh: all cds are much much shorter for outlaw
[3:38:54] Odd__Thomas: @Rayao pretty much, but now u have to pick core abilitys as well which is odd
[3:38:59] Avatarblade: with relentless blades you reduce all your CDs when you use a finisher so it's not really 45s
[3:38:59] Genilort: im not surprised if some people going to find out some op asf builds for pvp
[3:39:14] bazziiiTV: @BLACKFOOT_TN its bascially the same thing they did with some of the soulbind traits. there were soulbind traits that you had to take which did nothing to your build/playstyle in order to get to a potency slot. cant see why they would shy away from that in talent trees
[3:39:30] Truthseeker96: thats a must talent
[3:39:31] Crumikz: u NEED restless
[3:39:34] Truthseeker96: huge
[3:39:39] your_sister_2499: Yeah they should do some PvP beta/alpha testing before they put anything in the game lol
[3:39:41] BLACKFOOT_TN: We will all know the final still in development rotations at the end of Beta. As of right now none of this is what you should expect to see at launch.
[3:39:49] Crumikz: Core mechanic
[3:39:54] Odd__Thomas: yeah its def gonna change before it comes out.
[3:39:54] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[3:40:16] Odd__Thomas: with all the feedback most players are gonna give i see things being so more cleaner at least closer to release. or i hope so
[3:40:23] Truthseeker96: yup thats a rotation buffer
[3:40:25] Klutar: yeh thats huge
[3:40:31] stumper1231: @BLACKFOOT_TN yeah... the past taught us that everything will be nerfed and it will be much worse KEKW
[3:40:44] aThiccBoii: This xpac gonna bomb so hard.
[3:40:44] BLACKFOOT_TN: True
[3:40:55] swampt1l: 7 combo?
[3:40:56] swampt1l: jesus
[3:40:57] Wolfenhoof: Who invented this roll the bones bullshit never played a weapon rogue or really hated the class.
[3:40:58] NoSkillNoCash: oh thats a mechanic already
[3:41:02] Truthseeker96: yeah
[3:41:08] Rayao: its like that on live too
[3:41:09] Odd__Thomas: this talent tree system gives me Rift vibes
[3:41:10] swampt1l: KEKW @aThiccBoii
[3:41:14] Avatarblade: any finisher that matches the charged CP
[3:41:14] TimmyShoes: is this the tree for wotlk?
[3:41:16] BLACKFOOT_TN: As long as the raids and the PvP M+ is bonkers fun people will come back.
[3:41:38] your_sister_2499: I watched a rogue pvp on alpha and had the guy stun locked from start to finish was Brutal lol
[3:41:49] Truthseeker96: thats huge
[3:41:55] CAPT_Crack: Slicerdicer
[3:42:08] BLACKFOOT_TN: Honestly I kinda like current talent model. But like SV being made into melee I got no say in the matter.
[3:42:16] Klutar: old artifact ability
[3:42:17] Odd__Thomas: thats the legion thing
[3:42:18] Avatarblade: it is
[3:42:19] benkynoo: yep
[3:42:20] TheCliffyShow: Yes
[3:42:21] KaisenSiru: Yes
[3:42:21] Crumikz: yes
[3:42:21] DarkviperTV: yep
[3:42:21] Nokterian: Ah the artifact power @Towelliee
[3:42:22] vladtepes490: it was
[3:42:23] Truthseeker96: bro this spec is gonna be crazy
[3:42:28] Truthseeker96: they need to balance it asap lol
[3:42:43] Nokterian: 1,5 min cd take it
[3:42:56] Odd__Thomas: hell they got till dec/jan if they push it back
[3:43:02] Odd__Thomas: tons of things will change.
[3:43:07] danielthegathering: np
[3:43:10] danielthegathering: it doesnt stack
[3:43:18] BLACKFOOT_TN: Envokers gonna be broken AF we know thats coming. Then they will nerfed into the ground like Mistweavers lol.
[3:43:20] roodenburgertje: doesn't work I think
[3:43:23] your_sister_2499: I am curious to see if Evoker DPS will do as much dmg as other classes with all the utility they bring lol
[3:43:27] roodenburgertje: probably bugged?
[3:43:33] vladtepes490: They though they stacked
[3:43:34] NoSkillNoCash: maybe its supposed to stack
[3:43:36] vladtepes490: or not working
[3:43:37] Avatarblade: ye put the main tree one into somehting else
[3:43:57] bukka_hot: gotta take them all
[3:44:01] Carlenzo: kinda cool that the picture looks like van cleef
[3:44:06] your_sister_2499: I feel like you can’t be a envoker DPS with high Utility, DPS, and side heals lol
[3:44:08] Odd__Thomas: wonder if frost is gonna be a tank spec again. or at least close to it like WOTLK
[3:44:10] TheCliffyShow: Count the odds is a conduit.
[3:44:24] Truthseeker96: ehh
[3:44:32] Avatarblade: restless crew is not something you need as solo btw
[3:44:41] bazziiiTV: not sure if i am a fan of the whole tree has to be connected. iirc old talent trees had free placed talents and talents that were connected right? why dont they do that again. i mean at least you could place a few free of connection talents somewhre in the tree, just limit them by already spent points or sth
[3:44:45] bukka_hot: hairy members
[3:44:46] NoSkillNoCash: WTF
[3:44:52] Truthseeker96: huge utility yea
[3:44:53] Tamz_tv: it's so dank
[3:44:56] kulriko: that's the one
[3:44:59] TheCliffyShow: That's the one.
[3:45:08] Odd__Thomas: they are trying to mix it up and make it be like a hybrid kinda thing now it seems
[3:45:09] Crumikz: that's insane
[3:45:14] Truthseeker96: 35 energy reduce nice
[3:45:16] Odd__Thomas: a lot of other MMOs have went that route as well over time
[3:45:18] vladtepes490: the idea from the sounds of it is your would hit shadow dance spam the crap out of ambush till you have all the roll the bones abilities then hit keep on rollin ability
[3:45:21] vladtepes490: from the sounds of it
[3:45:35] Klutar: i guess if you proc lots
[3:45:36] Tamz_tv: ^
[3:45:37] Klutar: you use it
[3:45:40] Rayao: roll a 5 bone, and extend it sounds OP :D
[3:45:41] Klutar: and have them all longer
[3:45:41] Aphro_Samurai: if you get all the rolls, it could be good.
[3:45:42] Avatarblade: well if it's affected by restless blades, it will be a 3 min CD
[3:45:43] domzshait_reborn: it is insane of you get all 5 procs
[3:45:44] SpeedhTV: imagine extending a 5 buff
[3:45:46] love_eggplant: that tree is awful LOL
[3:45:47] zaetemira: with the cd reduction its good
[3:45:48] Bucket_AU: 5min cd's are almost always bad but there's so much built in CDR maybe its ok
[3:45:56] Odd__Thomas: im still gonna play the game. its WoW and we dont have many other options when it comes to MMOS
[3:46:05] Crumikz: it's will be like 2min cd
[3:46:06] zaetemira: yes i think 2-3%
[3:46:08] vladtepes490: yulp
[3:46:10] Klutar: yup
[3:46:10] bazziiiTV: its really rare, but yeah
[3:46:11] Shuppeet: greenskins wickers i bugged u can spamm if they didnt fixed it
[3:46:14] your_sister_2499: Damn straight down the middle lol
[3:46:14] Klutar: can get all buffs
[3:46:15] Avatarblade: ye you can roll all 5
[3:46:17] Rayao: 1% i believe for 5 buffs
[3:46:19] BLACKFOOT_TN: I main Demo lock. I just want Insta cast Tyrants and when I summon Tyrants I get 2 instead of 1. And maybe buff all my Demons by 90% just to bring them in line with what they should be.  /sarcasm kinda lol
[3:46:21] iMbrator: That' sit 5?  We get more now
[3:46:34] Darkterror141: is it me or the outlaw tree nodes form a skull?
[3:46:40] Odd__Thomas: also i love the new setup in the background @Towelliee its been  while since ive been here. loving it
[3:46:40] king_julian_96: any dungeons available yet toweliee on the alpha
[3:46:45] George2001k: With the talent you picked just before, I guess
[3:47:02] Odd__Thomas: only the old ones
[3:47:09] Odd__Thomas: dung wise.
[3:47:11] BLACKFOOT_TN: No new dungs
[3:47:14] bazziiiTV: damn playing roll the bones without a proper WA to show you the buffs seems like a pain in the ass : D
[3:47:22] BLACKFOOT_TN: Thats most likely happening in Beta
[3:47:26] Truthseeker96: this rotation is gonna be everywhere lol or maybe im wrong
[3:47:38] Odd__Thomas: i dont see us using most the skills we pick like stated before
[3:47:46] Odd__Thomas: depending on the content u run
[3:48:03] Odd__Thomas: like pvp/pve wise its def gonna be like more or less abilitys
[3:48:08] Y1mo88: This alpha?
[3:48:13] Odd__Thomas: yes*
[3:48:17] your_sister_2499: Imagine the kinds of skips you can do in mythic plus with envoker lol just fly with me skip passed packs for those non potion fools. Unless it pulls mobs flying over.
[3:48:35] Odd__Thomas: i think it does pull
[3:48:45] Y1mo88: Only evoked can fly though
[3:48:45] your_sister_2499: Damn
[3:48:57] Odd__Thomas: yeah the grip one would pull
[3:49:09] Odd__Thomas: but the 5min cd one idk if it works in dungs?
[3:49:12] real_doc1: u cant fly in dungeons
[3:49:22] Odd__Thomas: yeah thats what i was thinking
[3:49:26] your_sister_2499: Nah you can only use fly with me in dngs
[3:49:35] BLACKFOOT_TN: Bro you know they gonna hot fix shit left and right between Warlock gates through walls and EVs carrying people around.
[3:49:53] Odd__Thomas: hell they tried to fix warlock gates now
[3:49:53] deliora7: so how does this work do u get benefits from both specs are they both active?or u just get the passives? its kinda confusing no?
[3:50:00] your_sister_2499: I wish you could pick them up and manually drop them in the air lol
[3:50:01] Odd__Thomas: and we still abuse it on m+ skips
[3:50:28] BLACKFOOT_TN: They broke lock gates in Mists but then unbroke them again. You can still root skip
[3:50:35] Nevindaz: KEKW
[3:50:36] Y1mo88: You think this will come out this year? Or will be pushed back to early next?
[3:50:40] Nevindaz: will see
[3:50:45] vladtepes490: I was going to say if you could the skips would be insane lol
[3:50:46] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[3:50:56] Odd__Thomas: the left side is all abilitys u use as that class the right side is ur main spec
[3:51:02] Nevindaz: the perseveration is already too op as heal
[3:51:22] Odd__Thomas: i dont like that u have to choose a interrupt , thats gonna be a shit show in runs
[3:51:24] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: haha dont woryy it WILL go l,iv
[3:51:26] your_sister_2499: It would make sense to use fly with me in pvp or out in the world but in dngs I can see them disabling it and leave rescue
[3:51:27] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: live
[3:51:28] vladtepes490: That is a pvp nightmare and even VERY nice pvp utility
[3:51:31] vladtepes490: pve
[3:51:38] BLACKFOOT_TN: Think about. EV takes Warlock up to some place they were never meant to be. Then lock drops a gate and everyone skips outside entire trash pulls. Blizz is asking for people to break the game lol.
[3:51:39] Truthseeker96: now that you have blade furry you have to pull multiple mobs when its up ok? lol
[3:51:43] Dornagoth: If a race can only have one class aren't the racials part of the class?
[3:51:50] Odd__Thomas: does that mean they are gonna be a glass cannon though?
[3:52:02] your_sister_2499: Idk people get pissed off when classes use a push bag in keys probably won’t have that on my bar unless I know there’s a wall behind them
[3:52:05] Y1mo88: As long as blood will still be good enough for m+ I’ll be happy
[3:52:06] Hjolt: well, its kind of funny to think about because right now essentially ANY race ability for evokers might as well be a baseline class ability. what's the difference besides flavor text Kappa
[3:52:09] vladtepes490: you do
[3:52:09] your_sister_2499: Back*
[3:52:11] king_julian_96: any dungeons available yet toweliee on the alpha
[3:52:15] Avatarblade: dont even put garrote on bar
[3:52:16] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: ofc u use garrote as assa
[3:52:17] Truthseeker96: ambush on melee and garrote on casters
[3:52:21] swampt1l: No @king_julian_96
[3:52:25] Odd__Thomas: no @king_julian_96 just old ones
[3:52:30] your_sister_2499: You can do shadowland dngs about it or old content ones
[3:52:30] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: oh yeah u dont need it
[3:52:34] Klutar: just ambush
[3:52:38] vladtepes490: because you get armor piercing with expose weakness when you ambush
[3:52:46] Odd__Thomas: its like frost strike/obv strike in cata for dk.
[3:52:47] Kossith61: is that cow rogue?
[3:53:02] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: for pvp it has a use against ferals , mages and other rogues but for pve u dont need it
[3:53:04] PirateBob_: Just keep rtb buff active, hard to track with this ui, use dispatch and bte at 5+cp, use bte on cd, only pistol shot with oppertunity proc, deathly on cd, mfd on cd, keep snd up, this is gonna be alot og buttons, dreadblades and ar when you need to blast
[3:53:08] kreff_: @kossith61 it is my dude
[3:53:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: You keeping up with the Yankees? @towelliee
[3:53:17] Klutar: SS to build points
[3:53:23] Klutar: pistol shot when it procs
[3:53:23] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[3:53:26] Odd__Thomas: depends on what ur doing tbh
[3:53:28] Avatarblade: inastant and numb
[3:53:30] brutaltv: instant crippling
[3:53:31] redbulladin: instant and numb for dps
[3:53:32] brutaltv: for pve
[3:53:33] vladtepes490: keep up slice n dice between the eyes on cd and dispatch a lot
[3:53:36] Avatarblade: or crip
[3:53:36] redbulladin: cripp instant if u wanna slow em
[3:53:38] Truthseeker96: sinister strike then procs into full combo points on your best finisher
[3:53:39] danielthegathering: YES
[3:53:42] vladtepes490: pretty much
[3:53:42] Aphro_Samurai: Sin strike to max combo, use pistol shot on procs. maintain slice and dice. IF slice and dice is up, use dispatch. rinse and repeat
[3:53:43] Odd__Thomas: crip/wound are pve
[3:53:47] Odd__Thomas: pvp*
[3:53:53] PirateBob_: Yes
[3:53:57] Klutar: yeah just when it procs
[3:54:11] Odd__Thomas: numbing is cast time
[3:54:16] Klutar: otherwise same as before, keep slice up, use you roll the bones
[3:54:19] Klutar: dispatch otherwise
[3:54:50] redbulladin: yes
[3:55:09] Klutar: blade flurry is just an aoe CD
[3:55:10] Eikus11: I thought Tauren Rogue was coming before DF? It's a combo I have wanted for about 10 years!
[3:55:14] Truthseeker96: blade furry is an aoe
[3:55:18] bahtiblack: Ass Rogue :)
[3:55:19] Odd__Thomas: yeah unlike before idk if its diff now u can only use a main poison and a off hand poison
[3:55:22] PirateBob_: I would recommend just use rtb on cd, since buffs is confusing and hard to track with this ui
[3:55:32] Sleyenda_UK: slice and dice always first thing you get
[3:55:32] Truthseeker96: yup
[3:55:37] your_sister_2499: What’s your main on retail?
[3:55:39] Odd__Thomas: yeah mostly done in cleave
[3:55:40] Klutar: between the eyes it buffs your damage
[3:55:41] elandura: envenom is a regular cast, between the eyes is not.
[3:55:45] vladtepes490: you just keep between the eyes on cd because you get buffs from casting it
[3:55:48] PirateBob_: Bte on cd if you have greenskin
[3:55:49] swampt1l: Prot pally @dolegowski0402
[3:55:53] vladtepes490: and it hits hard
[3:56:14] bahtiblack: @dolegowski0402 Prot Pala
[3:56:19] Truthseeker96: can you grip while stealthed?
[3:56:19] maleVIKTz: you used to be a main rogue way back right?
[3:56:29] Aphro_Samurai: between the eyes is a self buff. things wont last long enough for you to use it. but finisher prio is Maintain Slice and dice, if it will live long enough use Between the eyes, then Dispatch
[3:56:31] vladtepes490: you can @truthseeker96
[3:56:38] Odd__Thomas: off topic did u see the changes to combat in ESO where u dont even need to use ur ability's its auto now @Towelliee
[3:56:39] kunqq147: Fishing for Pistol Procc and use it after spending 6 Point in Between the eyes
[3:56:40] Truthseeker96: ooo! nice
[3:56:41] Klutar: gonna be hard to test just killing mobs questing
[3:56:45] PirateBob_: Cd
[3:56:47] Klutar: stuff will die too quick lol
[3:56:51] PirateBob_: Its a cd
[3:56:52] Avatarblade: RTB is something that will require a WA even with this interface
[3:56:56] Truthseeker96: and mark can also be used while stealthed right?
[3:56:58] your_sister_2499: Nice, I think rogues the only class I’m scared to touch lmfao too much for my brain
[3:57:14] vladtepes490: I would guess it would be stealth ambush till you have all your roll the bones buffs up, hit keep it rolling them dread blades and start spamming your spenders from my guess
[3:57:22] Skold__: it's Otto, he presses the buttons for you
[3:57:28] Tamz_tv: I'm tryna reroll rogue RN those trees have my heart
[3:57:35] kowaikokoro: 100% 5 buff uptime GIGACHAD
[3:57:38] Klutar: you don't lol
[3:57:44] Sleyenda_UK: i use an addon called xroll
[3:57:46] Molvonos: You just watch your buffs really
[3:57:47] Skold__: you don't
[3:57:49] your_sister_2499: When o try to play rogue I feel like I’m studying at Harvard
[3:57:49] KaisenSiru: KEKW
[3:57:50] batmern_: LULW
[3:57:53] szble: the icons yeah
[3:57:58] LoseAlotLuke: you need a WA with text telling you what you got
[3:57:59] Vahs_Redclaw: yeah memorize icons
[3:58:02] SkyclashTV: rarely
[3:58:02] Klutar: it's a chance
[3:58:02] Vaken_: They should have a visual que for those
[3:58:04] Truthseeker96: lol
[3:58:06] Molvonos: You get up to five
[3:58:10] Sleyenda_UK: RNG lol
[3:58:12] vladtepes490: they do need to fix that, most of the time you just get a weak aurea
[3:58:15] batmern_: you can get all 5 if u lucky
[3:58:16] kowaikokoro: modCheck 5 buffs
[3:58:16] Coriollis: imagine getting 5 LULW
[3:58:16] Odd__Thomas: u can light attack/heavy weave an the bar abilitys go off passively  its gonna be pretty odd idk if its a option to turn on or off but its in the works on testing
[3:58:17] SkyclashTV: outlaw takes ALOT of work for meh rewards
[3:58:17] Truthseeker96: test it while stealthed pls i wanna if you can use it
[3:58:17] Klutar: casino class
[3:58:18] Recruitie: it's GAMBA
[3:58:18] Vahs_Redclaw: its RNG
[3:58:18] Wcvechten: you just gotta hope you roll good lmao
[3:58:20] swampt1l: KEKW
[3:58:21] xThaliner: 1-5 bonusses
[3:58:21] Vahs_Redclaw: 1 2 or 5 irr
[3:58:24] K3ks112: stillbetter then old roll where u just spammed reroll
[3:58:26] swampt1l: We playing the lotto
[3:58:28] Molvonos: There are talents that let you 'fix your dice'
[3:58:31] MerffTV: And to think they gutted Combat Rogue for this Roll the Bones bullshit
[3:58:37] Wadjaah: Gotta pray for a 5 buff every pull
[3:58:38] Fruity_Pebbles2018: is flying going to be unlocked in shadowlands in this expansion if you dont have the achievement?
[3:58:42] Odd__Thomas: yeah outlaw has always been a gamble class
[3:58:46] PadidinJones: I think there is a stat to build on that will give you better rolls
[3:58:47] your_sister_2499: My ex used to play rogue and I’d know when he got a bad roll you’d just hear the cries on his voice LMFAO
[3:58:52] Odd__Thomas: it is a pirate spec.
[3:58:54] wildwittra: "casino rogue"
[3:59:00] batmern_: yep
[3:59:02] hoontang: Roll the bones actually made me hate 1h rogue. Used to like combat.
[3:59:04] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Bro Outlaw is LIGHTYEARS better than what combat was
[3:59:06] nicolai_original: Well atlest its not like legion where u had to spetn points on roll the bones
[3:59:12] hoontang: Been waiting forever for them to swap that.
[3:59:13] Molvonos: Outlaw does silly damage -- if they get a five roll, they do obscene damage
[3:59:13] Avatarblade: ye the variance on outlaw is stupid
[3:59:14] kowaikokoro: PepeLaugh outlaw gamers
[3:59:18] Truthseeker96: its bad lol
[3:59:19] redbulladin: yes
[3:59:20] raye_gaming22: is cassino since legion lol
[3:59:33] redbulladin: there is a addon called roll the bones
[3:59:33] kunqq147: I mean, its a 1% Chance for 5 Buff
[3:59:37] kunqq147: WHo cares
[3:59:37] elandura: parsers don't think about it, because they barely play outlaw
[3:59:44] Odd__Thomas: yeah tbh blade fury is the parse lol
[3:59:44] Taaliaaaa: parsers dont play outlaw
[3:59:48] redbulladin: you heard when you can see what rolls you get more clear
[3:59:51] bukka_hot: need to yell bonus bonus bonus each time your roll
[3:59:51] Klutar: when you get the 5 proc though, FeelsGoodMan
[3:59:54] Bogzeh: used to be worse before it had a cd
[3:59:57] SkyclashTV: you dont
[3:59:59] Truthseeker96: @xthomas right lol
[4:00:02] PirateBob_: Its not that big of a deal anymore, the difference is not that huge
[4:00:03] Aphro_Samurai: u can open up on it
[4:00:03] szble: use when u need dps
[4:00:10] Sleyenda_UK: i wouldnt use dread blades xD
[4:00:19] vladtepes490: you ambush till you have 5 buffs then pop it
[4:00:20] Avatarblade: ambus on the stealth bar
[4:00:22] Klutar: stealth
[4:00:25] peaceful12: Think you dragged your garotte off by mistake :)
[4:00:25] your_sister_2499: Feels bad when you get a bad roll on the kill but a good roll on a wipe
[4:00:32] Truthseeker96: test roll the dice while stealthed real quick
[4:00:35] vladtepes490: its not gonna to work tho with out shadow dance
[4:00:35] Coriollis: garotte for stealth and in
[4:00:39] vladtepes490: the only issue
[4:00:47] Odd__Thomas: its so odd seeing a tauren rogue
[4:00:48] Truthseeker96: oooo
[4:00:51] Truthseeker96: DOOOD!
[4:00:52] Coriollis: xD
[4:00:53] Sleyenda_UK: it has a silence built should use it for that
[4:00:56] Klutar: big gamaba
[4:01:00] Klutar: gamba
[4:01:09] BLACKFOOT_TN: Breh
[4:01:11] Truthseeker96: yea
[4:01:13] BLACKFOOT_TN: WTF
[4:01:14] Truthseeker96: and mark of the death
[4:01:15] Truthseeker96: brooo
[4:01:17] Diamondead1: i mean tauren rogue is nothing new to me, i use a toy to turn into a tauren, it was always silly
[4:01:19] ShadoodHD: dont use garrot? talent tree begs to differ LUL
[4:01:20] swampt1l: Wait what did you roll Kekw
[4:01:20] Odd__Thomas: thats pretty much how it is now
[4:01:23] danielthegathering: thats how it works now
[4:01:24] bauwzen: thats how it works now :)
[4:01:25] Avatarblade: yes how it works now
[4:01:32] Aphro_Samurai: Ambush, Dreadblades, SS(or pistol shot proc), Slice and Dice, SS, Between the eyes , SS(or pistol shot proc) , Dispatch @Towelliee for an opener
[4:01:40] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:01:42] Odd__Thomas: nah its just rng
[4:01:44] Taaliaaaa: you're not it just sucks
[4:01:49] WickedNastyGaming: Lead with roll the bones. Then ambush.
[4:01:53] Keirmot: You're not doing anything wrong, the spec is just shite
[4:01:59] Truthseeker96: im just theory crafting sorry for my excitement lol
[4:02:04] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Is that an extra bag slot or something else?
[4:02:10] banshay3: is that a tauren rogue wtf?
[4:02:11] swampt1l: Just play sub the mega
[4:02:14] swampt1l: Meta
[4:02:16] Sleyenda_UK: slice and dice first
[4:02:20] DoubleNova: what is the "fun" spec of rogue?
[4:02:33] Klutar: yeh
[4:02:36] Avatarblade: ye
[4:02:36] Youredoneson666: yes
[4:02:40] Rudric_Ice: @DoubleNova sub
[4:02:42] PirateBob_: @doublenova outlaw
[4:02:46] Klutar: dispatch is your main spender
[4:02:47] Odd__Thomas: tbh u should be able to play any class/race combo besides the new  Hero classes being DH/Evoker
[4:02:49] Senile_Preacher: @DoubleNova ass
[4:02:51] Nicoz971: Tauren rogue looks so silly
[4:02:51] Klutar: yup
[4:02:56] danielthegathering: if you have garrote, check if that deals more dmg than ambush
[4:03:14] MaleFrom73: I don't like slice and dice. For me it feels like I am nerfed until it is up, not somthing that makes me do dmg
[4:03:17] Aphro_Samurai: Slice and dice > Between the eyes (if it lives long enough) > Dispatch
[4:03:17] Odd__Thomas: i mean think about it dead mines had a tauren rogue
[4:03:21] Odd__Thomas: so its meta
[4:03:24] DoubleNova: lol I got 3 different answers, I guess it's subjective
[4:03:31] Avatarblade: there's a roll that extends SnD
[4:03:34] PirateBob_: Use marked for death in stealth and get snd before opening
[4:03:44] Coriollis: u gotta roll
[4:03:48] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Is that an extra bag slot or something else?
[4:03:54] Odd__Thomas: yeah mark snd/roll
[4:03:55] Rudric_Ice: no lol
[4:04:01] Avatarblade: you can get 1,2 or 5, can't 3
[4:04:06] kowaikokoro: PepeLaugh PopCorn
[4:04:07] ripperino4k: sounds like train
[4:04:08] Akermay: Towelliee Tingle
[4:04:09] your_sister_2499: Idk what I should do horse or alliance for dragonflight… I always play the faction with the most lore for the expansion lol.
[4:04:10] ripperino4k: Kappa
[4:04:27] RandomWeirdo_: going to be a long stream :)
[4:04:29] swampt1l: I feel a 1
[4:04:33] Sleyenda_UK: wait you have mark for death?
[4:04:33] kimmo_gaming: Its an Outlaw rogue, not Casino rogue LOL
[4:04:46] Klutar: bahaha
[4:04:47] Odd__Thomas: outlaw is a gamble like how ur procs are on enhance
[4:04:53] KaptajnSkurk: 2 buffs is generally good depending on the buffs. The shark buff is always good.
[4:04:54] kowaikokoro: 1 buff gaming Sadge
[4:04:57] bukka_hot: wait for another roll :)
[4:05:00] Sleyenda_UK: if you have mark for death use that before pull
[4:05:01] Coriollis: gamba stream Pog
[4:05:01] Truthseeker96: I love outlaw rogue its pretty simple imo
[4:05:02] ShadoodHD: outlaw rogues atm towCopium
[4:05:21] swampt1l: Outlaw Casino
[4:05:28] Bucket_AU: You can mark for death, SnD in stealth
[4:05:29] iscripple: ROLL
[4:05:29] DoubleNova: all in on red
[4:05:32] KaisenSiru: Stampede Pog
[4:05:33] Odd__Thomas: good lord the hunter
[4:05:34] nightwolf_87: i want a holy cow now....
[4:05:36] WickedNastyGaming: Roll the bones, mark for death then ambush
[4:05:42] Impactus_Vult: What's that icon on the exp bar?
[4:05:43] your_sister_2499: Wtf are those dogs lol
[4:05:44] Odd__Thomas: they brought back stamp?
[4:05:47] Coriollis: ehhh never slice and dice full points xd
[4:06:07] your_sister_2499: Just saw like 20 dogs run at the damn mob
[4:06:08] Odd__Thomas: i dont i act like outlaw isnt a spec anymore
[4:06:11] Rudric_Ice: thats why i dont play outlaw
[4:06:12] swampt1l: Are you gonna try Sub? @towelliee
[4:06:12] PirateBob_: @coriollis ???
[4:06:16] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee Is that an extra bag slot or something else?
[4:06:22] Klutar: tolerate it with copium towCopium
[4:06:24] Avatarblade: you just press it and keep doing your rotation :D
[4:06:24] Rudric_Ice: sub best rogue
[4:06:26] Vaken_: Just like Survival, how does people tolerate that abomination
[4:06:27] Bogzeh: think its a love it or hate it thing
[4:06:31] Coriollis: @swordstick is not worth for low hp targets
[4:06:36] raye_gaming22: it was way way more worse abck in time were you could roll a 5x and go godmode and you needed to reroll allthe time with no cd
[4:06:38] Sleyenda_UK: its only for the elite kekw
[4:06:39] FrankTheTank1988: @Youredoneson666 its a reagent/crafting bag for DF, given all the new crafting materials.
[4:06:41] KaptajnSkurk: It used to be way worse. RtB used to be a combo spender
[4:06:50] ggilgamech: why is the dragon riding sounding like a jet??
[4:06:53] Phoenixzn6: FeelsBadMan
[4:06:58] Youredoneson666: @FrankTheTank1988 ahhhh ok, that makes sense. thanks
[4:06:59] nicolai_original: The way you tolerate is by remmeber how bad it was in legion when u spent 5 cp on roll just to reroll cuz of useless buff
[4:07:07] Klutar: it's like gambling irl, when everything procs you feel amazing
[4:07:11] Odd__Thomas: ^^^^
[4:07:14] plankdemi: why are these dragons so slow on the ground
[4:07:20] jure__: they should have you regen flying energy when you are flying close to the ground and objects
[4:07:22] szble: fishing for good buffs LUL
[4:07:25] xMortal_Wombatx: How does the selection of a dragon for dragonflying work? Do we select one dragon or do we get all dragons?
[4:07:25] your_sister_2499: How have the quests been so far been smooth?
[4:07:40] Odd__Thomas: if they do end up making more allied races i hope they fix the damn clipping on mogs
[4:07:47] Avatarblade: dreadblades would be more of a boss/m+ ability
[4:07:48] Odd__Thomas: taurens already have issues with clothing
[4:07:53] Sleyenda_UK: atm i dont really like dread blades as it costs health to use just dont like that personally xD
[4:07:53] raye_gaming22: they cut the rnd in half and its still dogshit
[4:08:12] kowaikokoro: D: true
[4:08:19] Wadjaah: yeah
[4:08:20] Odd__Thomas: yeah
[4:08:22] NinjaChane: yeah they should fix that
[4:08:24] Avatarblade: ye no auto dismont is bad
[4:08:24] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:08:25] Odd__Thomas: i agree.
[4:08:26] DoubleNova: is it just a coding issue?
[4:08:28] MerffTV: because its a vehicle
[4:08:32] nugsxd: its because its being treated like a vehicle
[4:08:34] nightwolf_87: ticket it !
[4:08:34] your_sister_2499: I was thinking: why don’t they have a ability where if you jump off a mountain you can call your dragon to glide you down or through the land
[4:08:35] Aierwin: Will they be doing more invites for people to join the Alpha or do you think they'll keep the pool of players small due to the way they're testing this time round?
[4:08:35] Eikus11: that classic feeling haha
[4:08:36] swampt1l: That’s so dumb
[4:08:37] Aphro_Samurai: i think they classify the dragon mount as a seige vehicle maybe? @Towelliee

[4:08:41] Youredoneson666: probable just hasn't be implemented yet

[4:08:56] Vaken_: yea, its literally as simple as a cancelaura macro built in to the spells
[4:08:58] Dystilled: It might be because its a vehicle, but it doesn't mean it will stay that way when the uproar comes
[4:09:04] Odd__Thomas: see i love the sounds of outlaw abilitys thought

[4:16:31] Viprekht: After I saw a new flight mechanic I wish all flying mounts would have been converted to this, the old one seems so boring to me now :')
[4:16:32] sulek23: @towelliee Is that tauren rogue? 0.o
[4:16:46] NYKO7_: @dudeimunknown if you mean ilvl then its around 380/390 i think

[4:18:15] kma_ape: can tauren be rogues now?
[4:18:17] HAMMERRAZOR: yea his up against other creators in the oceanic/asia region and his representing australia. His up against some big names, its got to do with how he games and how well he can engage with an audience through content creation
[4:18:18] Killduth: really curious though....is the dragon flying mechanic the same as guild wars 2 mounts?
[4:18:33] TheCliffyShow: @karter2811 The circle of WoW.

[4:23:06] Rudric_Ice: i liked the roll the bones when it was a combo spender
[4:23:12] vladtepes490: you could get 5 buffs every time keep it rollin is up theoretically
[4:23:15] kunqq147: You use Pistoil PRocc after Betwenn the eyes
[4:23:18] szble: either feel like a pleb or a god
[4:23:22] Odd__Thomas: @Rudric_Ice ur a mad lad.
[4:23:26] jure__: thats hunter harpoon

[4:25:14] zenniik: that kick animation xD
[4:25:19] Truthseeker96: you should be using it after ambush
[4:25:20] swampt1l: Next roll the bones is 5
[4:25:23] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: @ANGE1K all races can be rogue mage and priest
[4:25:23] Sleyenda_UK: dont normally use it so i dont know xD
[4:25:29] Molvonos: Grapple is more like Warrior Heroic Leap/V. Demon Hunter Demon Leap.  It's considered a  teleport and may disconnect you.
[4:25:33] Odd__Thomas: it shouldnt be a shocker for cow rogues. Deadmines had one
[4:25:45] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Taurens can be mages too now
[4:25:48] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: sadly
[4:25:49] Reofrax: Reofrax subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! had a dream about you last night Towelliee, så i guess u gotta get my prime sub for that

[4:26:25] LearnedSomething: just imagine you're playing diablo immortal :)
[4:26:28] Klutar: cloak of shadows
[4:26:31] Coriollis: cloack
[4:26:32] LearnedSomething: you'll get the 5, keep rolling
[4:26:42] ANGE1K: this tempts me to go back to wow and play cow outlaw, sounds op af xD
[4:26:44] swampt1l: Ban deez @creative_soups
[4:26:48] Rayao: Is crimson vial gone?
[4:26:49] PirateBob_: Cloak
[4:26:59] LearnedSomething: LUL
[4:27:03] swampt1l: 20?!? towPog towPog
[4:27:06] Klutar: if you get a 5 roll, end stream, go straight to the casino
[4:27:07] aladinsane444: Outlaw now can go shadowdance right?
[4:27:07] TheCliffyShow: @Rayao No, it's in there.
[4:27:08] elandura: 20 is not that much for that special unicorn :P
[4:27:13] swampt1l: Next one for sure
[4:27:27] Captainkappa123: Have you tried feral yet?
[4:27:28] Sleyenda_UK: 1%
[4:27:31] swampt1l: I heard 1%
[4:27:41] Rudric_Ice: yes just like your Sasszine mount KKEW
[4:27:42] Youredoneson666: Lets say in a normal raid time, you'll see it MAYBE twice
[4:27:47] Truthseeker96: 1% oof thats never gonna happen
[4:27:53] PirateBob_: 1 out of a 100
[4:27:53] szble: pretty rare
[4:27:54] almostdps: 2 talents for roll the bones right?
[4:28:00] Wadjaah: In legion it was a decent chance, I think they nerfed it to the ground in BfA
[4:28:00] almostdps: and then the rtb extender
[4:28:08] TheCliffyShow: I'm riding on a snail mount, and it's jumping. How is that physically possible?
[4:28:11] Tamz_tv: 3 hours ish
[4:28:13] zenniik: its rng man, sometimes you get it 2 times in a row and then you dont see it for a long time
[4:28:17] almostdps: raid night
[4:28:18] Youredoneson666: Nonono, like 3ish hours
[4:28:18] Klutar: he means a raid night
[4:28:21] ANGE1K: yeah outlaw rogues in general have better outcome when they go to the casino KEKW
[4:28:21] Youredoneson666: Time to clear raid, sorry.
[4:28:22] xsp00n: he means like 3hrs
[4:28:26] vladtepes490: no for 3 hours or so
[4:28:26] elandura: no for one night (3-4 hours)
[4:28:27] Dystilled: Apparently loaded dice in shadowlands upped the chance to 5%, but not sure if that applies to DF
[4:28:32] aladinsane444: @thecliffyshow its jumping snail
[4:28:33] mmrghost7: not that rare
[4:28:33] ANGE1K: cuz they go to the casino only when they rol 5buff KEKW
[4:28:36] LearnedSomething: one raid run's duration
[4:28:36] PirateBob_: You get buffs when using dispatch and ambush from stealth
[4:28:52] Mattias_Kz: What vape taste today+

[4:54:25] Dystilled: So what if someone accidentally pulls a boss while youre fighting trash? How do you remark to the boss?
[4:54:57] stumper1231: @Dystilled you kill trash
[4:55:01] keeev0401: you are the guy from big time rush?
[4:55:22] Dystilled: @stumper1231 that doesn't take you out of content if the boss is already pulled. Its 'first mob you attack in combat'
[4:55:24] swampt1l: All these stats increases bruh LUL
[4:55:27] Dystilled: out of combat*
[4:56:02] heavenphist: I always liked getting new spells at max lvl, this doesn't happen since a few expacs. Maybe in DF?

[4:57:17] theoriginalzinng: I want to see the actual tree and if you can build your talents like they did in bfa
[4:57:18] swampt1l: For furry
[4:57:19] PlebXL: do poeple think warrior will be a good pick?=) i wish i can could play warrior and still be invited to things:P
[4:57:35] Klutar: hahahaha
[4:57:45] Klutar: 10000%
[4:57:46] LearnedSomething: 100x
[4:57:46] zysmos: 10 seconds is way too long lol
[4:57:47] theoriginalzinng: What dropper warriors to the bottom was the inability to pick talents as they put a bunch of good ones on the same row
[4:57:49] almostdps: 10 seconds would be huge
[4:57:49] swampt1l: That seems broken
[4:57:52] liftedinxinfinity: this is all speculation its not official
[4:57:53] Exoduc: COGGERS forever
[4:58:05] Motraxtv: Looks like we get a lot of stats from that talent tree :D

[4:59:18] FrankTheTank1988: its alpha so ofc it is doublenova :D
[4:59:21] Dystilled: @DoubleNova its just data mining, not even confirmed to be in the alpha
[4:59:32] Skrarny: ye
[4:59:33] stumper1231: attach banana peel to shield to make the guy trip over it
[4:59:35] almostdps: yea
[4:59:37] FrankTheTank1988: for example the DK Core talent tree is being changed in an upcomming update.
[4:59:40] almostdps: but with auto attacks
[4:59:41] Maytan26: I hope they don't rush this expansion in any way
[5:00:04] levon0141: show arms and fury as well pls
[5:00:05] chubahi: it has 2 charges rn. i think thats wrong ?
[5:00:35] thenormalbeast: Shield wall seems good
[5:00:36] liftedinxinfinity: no idea why they post these, it gets people confused when its not official
[5:00:37] almostdps: well it will go back to 1 base and talent to 2 prob
[5:00:52] chubahi: maybe so :/
[5:00:53] theoriginalzinng: Shield block has 2 charges, not shield wall
[5:01:14] chubahi: oh it was shield wall ?

[5:02:00] Shrenko: removing dragonroar in a dragon expansion !!
[5:02:04] almostdps: so its now a 1m50s cooldown?
[5:02:16] elandura: I'd rather put shockwave's function bake into Dragon Roar and delete shockwave if I have to.
[5:02:50] MoxasTV: warrior is looking good

[5:05:03] zulway_: i hope we get to see some warrior testing on tuesday
[5:05:06] bahtiblack: @Dystilled No, unfortunately, they made their own decision.
[5:05:14] vladtepes490: prot warrior will never be fixed until they address the self healing issue, every other tank has SO much more self healing
[5:05:18] Sledgecore: let's see the Tauren sprint KEKW

[5:06:15] Dystilled: @bahtiblack just looked it up. Its due to legal compliance with local laws
[5:06:20] chubahi: pog
[5:06:26] Wolfenhoof: Amoosing how some people can't appreciate the natural grace of the tauren race.
[5:06:42] Endrish: can you use pet as a portal Anvil?
[5:06:42] LearnedSomething: agontfMad

[5:07:10] LearnedSomething: I don't think they're mad, it's just memes
[5:07:10] Klutar: if a tauren can be a monk a tauren can be a rogue
[5:07:12] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: cause taurens suck and makes no sense
[5:07:13] Vaken_: They can literally be monks already, so yea its not that far of a stretch
[5:07:28] django688: is thi8s MEG ?

[5:17:18] Lunarsear: he did the msq yea
[5:17:20] Archjin: yup
[5:17:22] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: hes so dumb man , he cryed aboput how he wants dragons in that game , now he gets than and he quit ..........
[5:17:22] Oswanov: he finished Endwalker
[5:17:24] SoLowCash: I've been queing w/ a horde warrior the last few days its pretty dope ngl
[5:17:24] 3dRes: seqElbow shut up about your pro alliance and horde nonsense. Let us all be one seqElbow
[5:17:25] zakare232: he has beaten endwalker yes
[5:17:27] V3_Ethereal: I think he's thoroughly lost in FF14
[5:17:30] Armdel: he think he has finished the story just now ye

[5:18:07] dkapocalypse: ally should being saying thank god  cause there too much horde
[5:18:09] ChuckyG0: @yuvalal tortollans were new tuskars u meant :P
[5:18:16] slamueljaksn: heya @Towelliee u prob already been asked this alot but do u think they will allow cross faction guilds at some point?
[5:18:19] V3_Ethereal: Shadowlands spooked 2/3 of the WoW lore creators I know from WoW
[5:18:20] smokemanjays: coz it was terrible on release
[5:18:23] 3dRes: "smoking vape"
[5:18:30] Bogzeh: all the lore is in the game in ff14 tho, not much content to do around it on utube
[5:18:36] Shrenko: I could see that
[5:18:38] Shrenko: LUL
[5:18:39] ShadoodHD: ff14 has some VERY philosophical lore if that makes sense
[5:18:53] Diamondead1: pyro
[5:18:54] Klutar: is that a weird glitch with your stealth stance bar? it's in your xp bar
[5:18:54] LearnedSomething: pyro
[5:18:56] GeT_LeNiN: He should read some 40k, only 400+ books
[5:18:58] Odd__Thomas: he does
[5:19:11] LearnedSomething: the kid who threw a fit :)
[5:19:14] Odd__Thomas: name suits him
[5:19:14] Angsterz: ff14 summary = your character nods to npcs talking
[5:19:15] Sarocus: Pyro. Good fucking riddance
[5:19:16] Winter7735: Pyro monkaS
[5:19:17] Wadjaah: I skip story in FF14 EZ
[5:19:19] FatChase: wh OMEGALUL
[5:19:19] cowthulhu1: pyro
[5:19:23] Orion280: every wow lore creator has been so stuck up their own headcanon they just lost it when their story wasnt the true story
[5:19:26] MrFariaH: the wow karen lol
[5:19:31] MaMad666: Unstable kid
[5:19:31] SpectraBG: @Wadjaah how dare you
[5:19:33] darudepogstorm: LUL
[5:19:36] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee No Night Elf paladin is the most boggle one, since we had a whole questline with a Night Elf Paladin in Legion Class halls
[5:19:36] SpectraBG: Kappa
[5:19:37] ShadoodHD: SKIPPER D:
[5:19:41] yuvalal: @yuvalal i more meant as in the  extra rep to normal ones, as kirin tor were in legion
[5:19:41] Angsterz: @Wadjaah some ff14 weeb is going crazy atm
[5:19:42] dkapocalypse: the other lore nut
[5:19:43] Xsilentghost: when do you think alpha will get its first dungeon
[5:19:43] aladinsane444: Pyro ripped apart the new wow book while playing ff
[5:19:45] cicatog_13: @Ooshraxa true
[5:19:47] swampt1l: Oh no,they are after you
[5:19:47] soth_klf: @Orion280 or maybe the story is just bad and they moved on with other stuff
[5:19:48] Ellycat1: Careful, you might get people knocking at your door. monkaS
[5:19:50] Youredoneson666: i made it 85% through ARR, then bought the skip as far as i could. KEKW
[5:19:59] Gillettefuzionz: @angsterz You character nodding to npcs is better than our character having no interaction and wow npcs really not remembering who we are each expac xD
[5:20:00] Sleyenda_UK: Whats final fantasy xD
[5:20:01] swampt1l: They got the Pitchforks
[5:20:02] Angsterz: @Ellycat1 or lalafels monkaS
[5:20:05] dkapocalypse: you can skip deez nutz
[5:20:08] DeleldurTV: NGL the story  of FF14 is what made me quit it, i was bored all the time in my 100 hours played
[5:20:08] Arkangel_I: pgeLook pgeLook
[5:20:10] PvtHudson093: dude there is somethings you just dont say out loud
[5:20:14] EnolaGranola: gassyP
[5:20:15] ShadoodHD: watchout for your kneecaps monkaS
[5:20:16] d1stract10n: I couldn't get into the story of ff14 to much your this oops we were wrong now your this. oops wrong again now this
[5:20:19] Velkith: I finished endwalker in 1 sitting. skipped all the story. come at me velkitLul
[5:20:27] LearnedSomething: do you think they'll invite preach to alpha?
[5:20:29] yuvalal: What is the endgame quest would be emessary like BFA/Legion ?or more like SL with daily quest?
[5:20:36] Failer91: FeelsGoodMan
[5:20:41] swampt1l: They didn’t invite Preach
[5:20:46] TirnanCP: Most FF players don't care that you skip. They just think you're weird if you do.
[5:20:53] swampt1l: He doesn’t “cover” wow anymore
[5:20:58] ShadoodHD: i mean he will eventually... right? towCopium
[5:20:59] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: Addicted ? Nah i dont thinks so , theres just no other game that derserve to wase my time
[5:21:00] somebdk: i use to be addicted to wow and now im just a game whore. cant stick with any games
[5:21:13] Zolshy89: his ego is too big to ask lol
[5:21:14] aladinsane444: Nobbel just need to cry more during cutscenes so his chat wont get angry again
[5:21:20] PvtHudson093: oh god chat is going to sperg out about Preach and Alpha
[5:21:31] Chickenpox40: I think he is being a little sensitive
[5:21:31] cerealkillas22: asking isn't the meta though,  complaining about it sure is tho zD
[5:21:31] Bogzeh: on the blacklist Kappa
[5:21:37] Rayao: has anyone tried looking at dragon isles map and the pandaria map side by side? :D seems kinda similar to me :D
[5:21:38] cerealkillas22: xD
[5:21:39] swampt1l: Time for bedtime,Goodnight y’all :D
[5:21:40] ShadoodHD: oh don't worry we already sperg it out earlier
[5:21:44] BoiAtomico: why would they tho? He said he won't cover wow stuff no more and all he does is bash the company lul plenty of content creators around
[5:21:45] HindenbergZA: doesn't make sense to me that they invite someone like Quin, he played it once and won't play again. Alpha is for testing, wouldn't it be better to invite him to beta? Just my opinion, salty opinion :D
[5:22:01] ShadoodHD: (is not the one who asked about preach) <.<
[5:22:08] Chickenpox40: ok
[5:22:16] steldam: Luxthos
[5:22:21] LearnedSomething: status
[5:22:21] bruhSit_farmer: preach is the goat
[5:22:24] LearnedSomething: it's about status
[5:22:24] OkayButch: OkayButch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 80 months! 
[5:22:27] blinca: preach EleGiggle
[5:22:28] robert_332: i am looking forward to spacegoat rogues
[5:22:28] swampt1l: There’s a video of Preach saying he was pissed LUL
[5:22:30] Odd__Thomas: true
[5:22:32] bahtiblack: is it an anvil :D
[5:22:38] nicolai_original: Thats what happend to soda, he was kinda pissed
[5:22:42] JuninBeyond: I dont get the whole fuss over preach not getting invited, he's not playing the game and has been bashing it for years right?
[5:22:42] Stawnchy: He even said he didnt THINK it would bother him, he was surprised it did
[5:22:51] ShadoodHD: i mean from what i understand, preach understood the comeback because he didnt apply for beta
[5:22:54] Odd__Thomas: i trash talk wow as a hardcore wow player but if a non wow player trashes it i go off on em lol
[5:22:58] LearnedSomething: yeah
[5:23:04] cerealkillas22: FOMO
[5:23:23] Elveny: Hey Towelie i just dropped by. Could you show for a second how easy or hard it is to customize the UI?
[5:23:28] bruhSit_farmer: those mana wyrms lookings HD as fuck
[5:23:31] LearnedSomething: that makes sense
[5:23:42] f1emitcher: i was in alpha for shadowlands and bfa but didnt get this one >.<
[5:23:43] Teldrin89: inviting streamers to alpha is probably more promotion than testing for blizz and they just went with current list based on that assumption (my opinion)
[5:23:45] SoLowCash: Loving the new ui changes
[5:23:56] bruhSit_farmer: new ui is clean
[5:24:03] Odd__Thomas: see i use to just use a macro for the eagles
[5:24:03] Moobot: THE HAMMER SQUAD CROSS FACTION COMMUNITY! https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/invite/7Ypy9yXc3B3?region=US&faction=Horde | NA FOR NOW
[5:24:04] ofnaldreya: Preach suggested it was because of his video where he critiqued blizzard and said he would move on from primarily covering WoW
[5:24:04] supersuhmz: so they integrated bartender
[5:24:05] Chickenpox40: i love it
[5:24:09] HindenbergZA: So glad they're letting us edit UI, not a fan of Elvui
[5:24:09] Shrenko: you cant move mini map yet ?
[5:24:10] ofnaldreya: Which if true
[5:24:11] TheItalianStallion321: so im assuming we wont need Elvui anymore? i guess
[5:24:17] robert_332: is that a dragon toad
[5:24:25] doomkry: maybe they will add an option to get more action barrs
[5:24:30] SpenceSir: Towelliee you looking for a grp or does the eye move all the time now?
[5:24:31] Senile_Preacher: still goin to use bartender for that LUL
[5:24:32] Elveny: Looks like a slightly worse version of Dominos
[5:24:39] Riuujin_: hey said he didnt
[5:24:42] Lethanos87: do you get flying from the get go in this xpac?
[5:24:46] Zolshy89: Kaapa
[5:24:54] Zolshy89: Kappa
[5:24:59] Sleyenda_UK: blue bar was charging
[5:25:00] Odd__Thomas: de other side Kappa
[5:25:03] yuvalal: report it
[5:25:06] raderkiller: if you dont ask and you dont play the game do you really expect to get in?
[5:25:06] TirnanCP: I don't think he's as pressed about it.
[5:25:15] Alepouditsa: Preach  didn't get it? good danEvil
[5:25:15] BoiAtomico: Preach got plenty to do in FFXIV as well, like someone said, FOMO about the alpha
[5:25:17] Stawnchy: @juninbeyond being critical is not the same as unjustified bashing. He was complaining about the same things as most of the playerbase...
[5:25:22] kyr_slowbro: He's on the outer circle now
[5:25:25] Odd__Thomas: the blue bar is the dragon
[5:25:27] bruhSit_farmer: definitely need preach's analysis
[5:25:28] yuvalal: where do you ask? can i ask too ?
[5:25:30] Ellycat1: Don't apply to alpha -> don't get invited -> shocked pikachu :O
[5:25:31] SSUFFERR: Yo, just want you to know you're the man bro :)
[5:25:36] ThatGuyFayde: So he didnt ask and hes suprised he didnt get an inv LUL
[5:25:37] SoLowCash: Im surprised they have so much content in this Alpha so soon
[5:25:41] LearnedSomething: that makes a lot of sense
[5:25:47] Odd__Thomas: is this the EOE
[5:25:49] warn1ng: top of the morning
[5:25:58] chubahi: @SpenceSir  i believe hes in LFG thats why they eye moving downthere
[5:25:58] TheItalianStallion321: im cracking up over this walking anvil lol
[5:26:04] Diamondead1: its better to ask then to give Pokimane alpha KEKW
[5:26:09] ShadoodHD: as long as you click on that apply for beta you gucchi
[5:26:10] bruhSit_farmer: this area looks amazing
[5:26:12] Odd__Thomas: this gives me heavy WOTLK vibes art wise
[5:26:21] Vattss: yo that's the 6 months sub mount
[5:26:27] SpenceSir: @subailin thanks
[5:26:43] melodyy421: he all so said he was warned by his spoke person that  if he stoped making wow content they would not wanna work with him anymore
[5:26:53] Odd__Thomas: do u see this expansion being casual friendly and alt friendly?
[5:26:54] Gingerprimer: Does not make regular wow content/and does not ask for alpha to be able to cover it and does not get alpha shocked face
[5:26:57] bruhSit_farmer: so refreshing seeing these zones after sl
[5:27:02] yuvalal: I want to apply , where do i do that ?
[5:27:04] Beave_86: is there regular flying?
[5:27:05] Manjoe81: I hope they never add flight paths
[5:27:08] yuvalal: i see
[5:27:08] robert_332: i like the wyrms for hunters
[5:27:13] pushnoir: you can ask if you know someone at blizzard
[5:27:19] Marts1: Would you maybe make a video of things you like or dont like so we can link it so the wow team maybe sees it?
[5:27:23] Importaint: @Gingerprimer making wow content doesnt get u in lol
[5:27:25] greeedy2137: Do you think they will add dragon racing between players?
[5:27:32] adeekoowy: @xthomas We dont know anything specific right now, its first week of alpha.
[5:27:50] Odd__Thomas: i hope its alt friendly at least.
[5:27:58] Vattss: I signed up on may and didnt get it :^)
[5:28:03] Odd__Thomas: tons of alts gear up late in the expansion
[5:28:10] Elveny: Soda said last night he didnt get it but a friend of his who has no connections to blizzard but played for a month totql got the alpha invite Lol
[5:28:11] Odd__Thomas: for the past 3 expansions
[5:28:13] bruhSit_farmer: if preach asked he would for sure get an invite, just like yourself
[5:28:13] Gingerprimer: @paracusia95 correct but almost all ppl who are CC and applied got in
[5:28:18] Fyeah: so how can he be pissed about it? is he someone special or what
[5:28:22] LearnedSomething: I signed up for beta
[5:28:23] Odd__Thomas: bfa was def not alt friendly with cloak and all
[5:28:31] LearnedSomething: I usually get in
[5:28:34] robert_332: i signed up for beta
[5:28:34] thepaladinjournal: imao Preach is NOT pissed
[5:28:42] MerffTV: do some of these streamers think they shouldnt have to ask?
[5:28:46] Odd__Thomas: might be click bait if anything
[5:28:47] thepaladinjournal: idiots on the internet are pissed he did not
[5:28:48] robert_332: i got ther beta for the past 4 xpacs
[5:28:48] Dystilled: Of course they want people that have actual interest in playing and testing. It would be like being upset about not getting a job you didn't apply for if you had a problem with that
[5:28:51] stabzmcgeee: so he blew up on stream for attention?
[5:28:52] Marts1: Would you maybe make a video of things you like or dont like so we can link it so the wow team maybe sees it?
[5:29:02] ShadoodHD: good god when did we go detective in this shit NotLikeThis
[5:29:03] Odd__Thomas: click bait irl
[5:29:17] thepaladinjournal: preach did NOT blow up on stream, stop spreading lies
[5:29:20] GeT_LeNiN: Kreygasm
[5:29:28] positive_ions: Did y'all see Asmon eagle eyeing all over the map the other day?
[5:29:29] thepaladinjournal: he laid out a fact
[5:29:34] geokouts: Blizz should telepathetic guess and inv people :P
[5:29:34] Dystilled: @vorianloken literally noone saying he is
[5:29:38] Cakeabsorber: @vorianloken KEKW
[5:29:51] stabzmcgeee: just watchedf the clip of him very pissed on stream
[5:29:53] elandura: people who shit on wow like it's their 9-5 jobs and says they're being "critical" about wow didn't get alpha, that's been my observation
[5:29:55] thepaladinjournal: just read the comments above
[5:30:07] tankroiids: i dont create content and i didnt sign up but i got in
[5:30:13] Vattss: tauren rogue looks so funny
[5:30:17] Thoreya: LUL LUL LUL
[5:30:17] Elveny: yeh but why did they give the alpha access to players that dont play wow
[5:30:28] Lethanos87: where on the world map is this place?
[5:30:30] scumlucki: @Elveny to hook them
[5:30:44] Gingerprimer: @elandura yeah and also ppl who are hard critzing wow got in like Belluar
[5:30:45] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Marts1 (warning)
[5:30:46] BadHassAvocado: People now blowing up about people not blowing up, WoW community btw LUL
[5:30:53] scumlucki: It says you need active game time to even get access so they probably do play wow
[5:30:54] Elveny: ye but most of them aarent content creators
[5:30:56] Odd__Thomas: tbh its just pick of draw imo
[5:31:03] Dystilled: Still got to make up the numbers so quests and dungeons end up getting tested
[5:31:04] Odd__Thomas: maybe based on play time?
[5:31:14] enLilija: They do. I've gotten into BfA alpha and while I stream occassionally I would not call myself a content creator
[5:31:14] cookiemonstersex: I got access and have no intention of playing it lol
[5:31:16] scumlucki: they should pick me imma great alpha tester
[5:31:20] Cakeabsorber: Pog
[5:31:21] scumlucki: ^lies
[5:31:27] yuvalal: they told you when the azure span testing will be over and they will move to other testing ?
[5:31:29] ShadoodHD: algorithm in a nutshell 4Head
[5:31:34] Cakeabsorber: The Pog is never a lie
[5:31:36] d1stract10n: not based on play time lol.
[5:31:36] Funderik: people thinking alpha access is only for PR is cringe. beta is when the PR machine begins
[5:31:37] elandura: @Gingerprimer there are people who really wants wow to be good, and there are people who wants to see wow in the ground and call themselves "critical thinkers". Bellular is the former.
[5:31:40] scumlucki: @cookiemonstersex dm me i got wow tokens for you
[5:31:41] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee I've gotten into alphas before, have no relation to Blizzard and do no content creation. I do test a fuckton on the PTR though, and report "ordinary" bugs.
[5:31:50] robert_332: oooooo new build
[5:31:53] JuninBeyond: Oh Im very curious to that!
[5:31:54] kangarooswtf: kangarooswtf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Still playing immortal a bit, or all done ?

[5:31:56] yuvalal: yes
[5:31:56] PvtHudson093: Can you tell them to put the world bosses inside an Instance to avoid  zone lag?
[5:31:57] Thoreya: i think ion said new leveling zone
[5:31:57] GeT_LeNiN: I guess its important to get every kind of player in it, a lot of gametime or not
[5:31:57] hikaritd: I really hope next week we get Warlock tree....
[5:32:08] Odd__Thomas: is it 58?
[5:32:27] yuvalal: there are no changes to old world right?
[5:32:29] SphinxyOCE: i want to see the dungeons so bad haha
[5:32:44] cabalish: they might test all areas first before any dungeons
[5:32:48] e93robert: any new achivement categoris added in alpha ? :)
[5:32:52] Odd__Thomas: makes sense like how DH were and dk were back in the day
[5:32:53] ShadoodHD: oooo an orc mage npc
[5:33:00] Cabbageman007: How is your Fitness routine going? Still making progress?
[5:33:02] Coldfire989: @hikaritd since they didn’t datamine but like one spell for it I doubt it is even close to ready
[5:33:03] BoiAtomico: #NeverLuckyCamp on the betas lul altho I reported a shit ton of bugs on my mates account when he got beta access. guess who gets invited to beta access often and barely plays? It ain't me
[5:33:03] MightyKeyboard: Can the new dragon race fly without a mount?
[5:33:09] Gingerprimer: @yuvalal except for the model uppdates they are also applied to the old world
[5:33:13] xRaZoNx: tauren rogue <3
[5:33:18] scumlucki: theres a gnoll dungeon but hogger isnt the final boss df gonna be trash
[5:33:25] Odd__Thomas: u can use a ability but its a 5min cd
[5:33:30] Vattss: Belular still makes wow content
[5:33:32] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Towelliee  Did you see Max and friiends do Envoker mythic 0 SL keys? 4 Envokers and both DK and Druid tanks changed around.
[5:33:32] Thoreya: lmaooo
[5:33:33] Odd__Thomas: its not like how druids fly
[5:33:38] zildrog: hes been pretty postive about dragonflight as well
[5:33:40] Snabido: @TheAtomicRam On your mates account? PJSalt
[5:33:40] MerffTV: he's also pretty fair
[5:33:40] SoLowCash: Exactly
[5:33:42] Sir_LagalotTV: belluar is mainly giving constructive critisim though
[5:33:45] Stellioni: Just for context. Is it a talk about Preach not getting Alpha invite?
[5:33:52] hikaritd: @Coldfire989 meh. I need to know if Affliction gets Malefic deleted because if yes, I preorder, if they dont delete it I skip DF LUL
[5:33:57] Cakeabsorber: @Stellioni yep
[5:33:57] Funderik: belluar will give praise where it's due tho, he did go way into the hating for clicks side tho.
[5:34:02] LightBladeStream: @Stellioni does he even want it?
[5:34:03] Marts1: I really like how positive you are and in my opinion you can much easier and better get your points out then :)
[5:34:04] Fyeah: not everything has to be positive but you cant get mad over upset or pissed over the fact that you didnt even try to get an alpha
[5:34:04] Coriollis: tbh w/e he said, Bellular and Asmon said it 10x times harsher idk seems petty but thats life
[5:34:09] ShadoodHD: it can be a hit or miss and can be definitely based on how much you want to spoil yourself in the early game, imo it can make you get bored faster in the long run
[5:34:11] scumlucki: They should get me in the alpha i preordered the epic edition like the clown i am
[5:34:15] BLACKFOOT_TN: Yeah but Bell is harsh. But also often right.
[5:34:18] cookiemonstersex: @stk_lucki Thank you, but I got other stuff to play right now
[5:34:31] vuurmannetje: Im not suprised preach didnt get it after the whole: Im not gonna cover wow anymore. Would you as a gamemaker?
[5:34:33] Odd__Thomas: yeah it was my guild that had me stay in shadowlands
[5:34:39] elandura: @Towelliee he want the game to be better, I consider his reaction as tough love. People like Preach and Zepla are spewing hate over their FFXIV pedestal.
[5:34:40] robert_332: well off to play retail have a great stream Towelliee
[5:34:42] CloudPants8081: towOof
[5:34:47] BoiAtomico: @Snabido Yeah, my mate had access but didn't play and borrowed me his account for a beta. He's been invited for every beta ever since LUL
[5:34:48] Dystilled: Theres merit in being critical. Its when people make noise just for the purpose of pushing an agenda or their hate for a game that gets to me
[5:34:53] Odd__Thomas: but i have no intention playing season 4
[5:34:55] vladtepes490: Hell I don't blame you, I took a year break
[5:34:59] scumlucki: @elandura leave zepla out of this
[5:35:02] Micheee: 9.1 was an awful patch
[5:35:08] Odd__Thomas: i got my keystone master and aotc and now ill wait till new expansion
[5:35:13] TheRiwen: I just cant do ZM anymore or the raid
[5:35:16] mr_tkd76: Different opinions are important. Sad to see Preach didn't get into Alpha.
[5:35:22] elandura: @STK_Lucki I'm not gonna ask you what to do.
[5:35:25] adeekoowy: We know anything about aspects to choose? Like covenants?
[5:35:29] Cakeabsorber: @STK_Lucki Leave britney alone! :(
[5:35:30] infinitrus: yeah i stopped just before 9.2 the content took ages to come out
[5:35:34] Gillettefuzionz: Bellular just isn't afraid to say what the game/devs need to hear. But he has the critical feedback approach, it is never just shitting on the game without any reasoning behind it
[5:35:39] Dystilled: @mr_tkd76 Sad why? he didnt ask for access
[5:35:40] vashaun: belluar is one creator i blocked on youtube. cant stand him
[5:35:43] shoelid: I'm still pissed that Nathanos died in the now-removed prepatch. impossible to see ingame now
[5:35:45] Gingerprimer: @mr_tkd76 he did not apply for it so...
[5:35:47] GeT_LeNiN: Then the people that jumps on the wagon...
[5:35:50] Coriollis: zackrawrr is a harcore WoW player :)
[5:35:50] OrlinTheMage: @Fendrick123 same
[5:35:53] enLilija: BfA hit me harder than Shadowlands. I've taken a 4 month break at the end of first season.
[5:35:54] ShadoodHD: i mean there are other ways to help the game, social media, forums... oh god the forums towCringe /s
[5:35:55] stumper1231: Shadowlands really helped us get rid of our addictions to the game.
[5:36:01] LusciousOCE: Are you a fan of asmongold towelliee?
[5:36:06] Skeezitz: split personality '
[5:36:06] Odd__Thomas: @stumper1231 facts
[5:36:08] LawnSpeaker: Bellular content is brain dead
[5:36:13] scumlucki: zack and asmon  is like night and day its fucking scary man
[5:36:24] cyddius: Is dragon riding only in the new areas or everywhere now?
[5:36:25] LightBladeStream: @LawnSpeaker Have you watched it?
[5:36:30] Tr4umhaft: is this all default UI or are you using any addons? haven't played WoW in over 10 years
[5:36:37] Marts1: Like asmons latest video is pretty awesome to see, if you dont like his asmongold persona
[5:36:37] Odd__Thomas: new area only
[5:36:39] sir_skaeg: why is there an anvil following you xD
[5:36:40] Jazuo: 2 things would have made Shadowlands better, more open dungeons and variety, and combined zones so you didnt have to use the taxi all the time..  you should be able to walk from zone to zone
[5:36:40] adeekoowy: @cyddius Only dragon isles i think.
[5:36:45] Odd__Thomas: its a pet
[5:36:47] Coriollis: asmon is for show , zack is him chilling is not that hard to understand
[5:36:48] Wadjaah: @Tr4umhaft there is no addon in alpha
[5:36:51] mr_tkd76: Because of what he represents. If they're trying to do anything with DF it's to turn peoples' attitude toward WoW back to positive, and I think Mike is a fair representation of that part of the player base
[5:36:54] LightBladeStream: peepoHappy
[5:36:56] Cakeabsorber: KEKW
[5:36:56] bullcra: hi
[5:37:00] KaisenSiru: Pet Pog
[5:37:04] FrankTheTank1988: default ui @Tr4umhaft its the new customizeable default minus unit frames (wich are currently not implemented)
[5:37:07] cyddius: @adeekoowy ah okay '
[5:37:07] Orion280: all my homies love alvin
[5:37:07] Tr4umhaft: @Tr4umhaft tyvm
[5:37:12] zappylul: Can you actually use it as an anvil?
[5:37:12] Cakeabsorber: @bullcra p dropped this
[5:37:14] Gingerprimer: @mr_tkd76 then he should have applied for it
[5:37:15] LawnSpeaker: @lightbladestream enough to realise that he has barely anything interesting to say
[5:37:16] MakaiiART: @STK_Lucki tbf most people are like this, just look at family and friends acting completely different when hosting party or whatever, compared to being at home lol
[5:37:18] jjoohhs: Bellular is a bit of a bad actor tbh , cares more about clicks than the games he plays
[5:37:27] Rudric_Ice: Btw tow sub rogue is easy to use shadowstrike then when your out of stealth use shadowdance spam shadow strike and eviscreate
[5:37:27] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:37:28] scumlucki: @Coriollis you sure he doesnt have a secret split personality lol
[5:37:30] Gingerprimer: @mr_tkd76 and I loved Preach
[5:37:32] ShadoodHD: anvil use body slam! *throws the anvil*
[5:37:34] Gillettefuzionz: @jjoohhs Not true in the slightest
[5:37:35] LearnedSomething: you have to put 10 crests in
[5:37:36] 3dRes: Looks like you're pulling the anvil by a piece of string KEKW
[5:37:45] LightBladeStream: @LawnSpeaker his takes on the Great Vault are very interesting
[5:37:49] abidetx: 1% chance for 5 buff still or did they remove
[5:37:51] kreff_: yeah it seems that Asmon's trashing wow more but Bellular does it more it feels like
[5:37:56] ShadoodHD: outlaw rogue is.... interesting
[5:38:02] kreff_: plus Asmon is a persona like Dr Disrespect
[5:38:05] scumlucki: @STK_Lucki my family acts the sameno matter where they are... loud and rowdy
[5:38:09] Xeeshki: tauren rogue just looks wrong
[5:38:13] ventu105: taurent rogue
[5:38:18] bullcra: do you know of other talent trees who are not presented yet
[5:38:29] FatChase: An echo chamber
[5:38:31] SoLowCash: @STK_Lucki It's him just putting on a show
[5:38:32] bullcra: warrior mage Pala usw
[5:38:36] almostdps: youtube is either ecstatic or rage, they get the most clicks
[5:38:37] BLACKFOOT_TN: I think Mike, Bell, and Zach/Asmond all represent different and same parts of the player base. To disregard what they say is to disregard people in their audience. Just have to take it all with a grain of salt and make your own opinions.
[5:38:43] Jazuo: ASSA rogue ftw
[5:38:48] scumlucki: @STK_Lucki yeh ik that
[5:38:49] Secondbreakfasttt: LOL
[5:38:56] 3dRes: @kreff_ to resemble him to Dr D is a wild take
[5:38:56] elandura: @Towelliee now you're talking :D
[5:38:59] Odd__Thomas: thats what she said
[5:38:59] Macrodotz: looks ass tbh
[5:38:59] Jazuo: ASSA is closer to classic why i love it
[5:39:03] Laluzmia: LOL
[5:39:14] FrankTheTank1988: there is a 10% roll the bones talent you dident pick up ;)
[5:39:18] EpicJune: there's no reason getting 5 should be this hard LUL
[5:39:19] Jasselito: Bro is that a tauren rogue?
[5:39:22] ShadoodHD: it's not hard it's rng Keepo
[5:39:23] Funderik: that's what annoys me with yt creators, i want them to be honest and not pander to the communities feelings poking the fire more.
[5:39:27] BoiAtomico: did the sound of the hooves gave you away so far in stealth @Towelliee ?
[5:39:27] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:39:31] kreff_: @3dRes i mean it's a persona that they play, just as doc plays his doc persona, he's maybe 10% of doc persona irl
[5:39:39] LawnSpeaker: @lightbladestream that may be, but who has time for the 3 hours split across 6 clickbait videos required to extract that take
[5:40:04] zappylul: Outlaw should always feel the best, its the best rogue spec.
[5:40:04] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[5:40:09] Shrenko: but poisen and bleed is fun
[5:40:10] bullcra: do you know if other talent trees are open yet
[5:40:11] scumlucki: i dont like rogue
[5:40:19] vladtepes490: like I said its very smooth feeling :P
[5:40:20] LightBladeStream: @LawnSpeaker It's a 23 min video on the main clickbair channel
[5:40:25] 3dRes: @kreff_ That i agree with. I misinterpreted your message
[5:40:26] bullcra: Pala warrior mage usw
[5:40:27] cerealkillas22: outlaw is the fury warrior of rogues
[5:40:28] KaisenSiru: Fun Pog
[5:40:30] steldam: Have you played any hunter yet?
[5:40:31] scumlucki: woyer main till i die let me execute more
[5:40:34] jaxiethedog: Is the pistol shot Lego a permanent ability in df?
[5:40:43] BLACKFOOT_TN: Anyone who can play Aff can play Ass rogue. Just different dots is all. ]
[5:40:45] Cakeabsorber: @kreff_ it's of varying degrees, dr d is over the top on purpose, asmon is more subtle than dr d but still quite a lot lol
[5:40:46] blinca: you guys know if i have to be friendly with the zandalar factions to unlock bfa wq on alts?
[5:40:47] Gingerprimer: @bullcra all trees that are out are on wowhead
[5:40:54] kreff_: @3dRes no worries my dude
[5:40:54] markibod: tbh i quit wow before shadowlands came out - same stuff different xpac, but i'm thinking of coming back for dragonflight
[5:40:59] Gingerprimer: @blinca pretty sure no
[5:41:07] LawnSpeaker: @lightbladestream in amongst a sea of mediocrity
[5:41:10] kreff_: @Cakeabsorber yeah thats my point, they cater to the audience, thats why they are successful
[5:41:15] bullcra: OK thx
[5:41:21] scumlucki: @markibod do it for the dragon riding
[5:41:30] Mr_Pennywise_: towCopium
[5:41:30] jay3isme: maybe try lighter
[5:41:37] sir_skaeg: can u warstomp in stealth ?
[5:41:38] GeT_LeNiN: What addon for minimap?
[5:41:41] Dystilled: @Cakeabsorber People like Asmongold because hes not afraid to blurt an opinion even if its wrong. His comments on stuff for OW2 were hot manure, but people liked it because he was emotive with it
[5:41:45] Motraxtv: slootI slootCopium
[5:41:51] markibod: @STK_Lucki thinking of coming back for dragonflight as i have a small obsession with dragons in general
[5:41:54] Wolfenhoof: You have to moo while pressing it.
[5:41:56] Rudric_Ice: so u get shadowstep as an outlaw too ?
[5:42:04] kangarooswtf: "fun" ? IN MY WORLD OF WARCRAFT ??
[5:42:11] Crakila: wtf is "fun"?
[5:42:13] LawnSpeaker: @lightbladestream that’s the nature of clickbait… you have no idea if there’s actually something worthwhile or not
[5:42:15] Crakila: kidding ofc.
[5:42:18] Crakila: It is great to see
[5:42:20] scumlucki: @markibod this is made for you cant wait to see your evoker called BadDragon
[5:42:21] EpicJune: true makes for healthy mmo competition
[5:42:23] Marts1: Why do you think some thinks it have to be either WoW or FF, and not both? Its good with some breaks here and there
[5:42:32] MOLAR305: lord knows i have tried to replace wow countless times...
[5:42:39] Narovoid: Hey @towelliee , I noticed in your older VODs for the wotlk beta that you had seal of vengeance and seal of wisdom both on your character at 1 time. Did you possibly report that cause that’s not supposed to be possible in game?
[5:42:39] blinca: @Gingerprimer @ProgettazioneInferni dont have them on my 50 alt, what should i do?
[5:42:42] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I actually asked Nobbel if he would return he said probably
[5:42:52] sir_skaeg: @Towelliee can u warstomp in stealth ?
[5:42:53] LightBladeStream: @LawnSpeaker Yes, it admit the clickbait is very annoying at times. Must suck if you don't even like the channel
[5:42:53] Dystilled: @Narovoid he did
[5:42:54] kreff_: I can't wait to DF, it seems like the earthly down-to-the-roots expansion that I've been waiting for seems like forever, no cosmic shit :D
[5:42:54] Sir_LagalotTV: the level design looks sick for so
[5:42:55] UmbraTheGreat: Thats the most logical and best take. Too many people lately are tribalistic
[5:42:55] abracka_: people just love fighting over which is better, no matter what it's under. sports, phones, games, etc
[5:42:56] Sir_LagalotTV: so far
[5:43:01] Cakeabsorber: @Narovoid wait he was seal twisting? PogChamp
[5:43:01] markibod: @STK_Lucki not sure what i'd play tbh - seen some updates but have to do more research. either way, gotta decide if i wanna lose my life to WoW again lol
[5:43:05] BLACKFOOT_TN: My biggest hope for DF is that Blizzard does a MUCH better job telegraphing mechanics. And stops making boss mechanics that blend in with boss room colors. And frontals in keys need work I think.
[5:43:15] figsaregood: @Marts1 Yeah neither game is worth 12 monthly sub payments to me, rather split them
[5:43:25] scumlucki: I like tanking in ff14 because of how easy it is all i have to do is turn the boss away just try not to die whilei do dmg
[5:43:30] garmin1987: how does the new UI feel now I like the look of it
[5:43:34] Snabido: Are you just throwing the dice? You have to shake 'em a bit first
[5:43:42] Narovoid: @cakeabsorber no, he was using both at the same time.
[5:43:47] LearnedSomething: blow on them first
[5:43:54] aruken: how does rogue feel right now? are all talent implemented?
[5:43:56] Cakeabsorber: @Narovoid DAAAAMN
[5:43:58] blinca: i did the first intro quests up to the welcome to the zandalar achiev @ProgettazioneInferni
[5:43:59] JoshStrobl: Tribalism at its finest
[5:44:03] Nokterian: The day that stealth cows came the game is changed forever..tippy clack toes LUL
[5:44:04] abracka_: @Towelliee what did you think about that paladin tier?
[5:44:04] Dystilled: MMOs are like major sports teams. Their fans will always hate on each other illogically
[5:44:19] ser3n1ty_: i got influenced by some ytubers and its my own fault for falling into that web and i deleted my 11 old acc cuz i was so pissed and went with the mob but in the end of the day i got a new acc and went back to wow and it was a valuable lesson to just do you and not blindly follow ppl
[5:44:20] Marts1: @Marts1 I also find it unrealistic to think you can play it every day for 2 years  :P
[5:44:21] scumlucki: @Dystilled atleast they dont have those cringy chants
[5:44:28] MaMad666: I am
[5:44:34] HindenbergZA: agreed
[5:44:38] Narovoid: @cakeabsorber it’s a bug that needs to be fixed. It’s not possible. You’re only allowed to have 1 seal on you at one time.
[5:44:44] Odd__Thomas: facts!
[5:44:46] tigzie: alll the tier looks meh
[5:44:53] LawnSpeaker: @lightbladestream maybe if I’d watched a good video of his first I’d have a different opinion, I’ll give the great vault one a go I guess
[5:44:58] scumlucki: tier gear aint even finished yet people jumping to hate
[5:44:59] BLACKFOOT_TN: Look I don't hate FF14. I think its a cool game with tons of great content. I just think the people who play it are dirty furry weebs is all.
[5:45:00] Wadjaah: They all look like Shaman armor sets to me
[5:45:01] figsaregood: Tier looks good to me, some classes need work tho
[5:45:03] Dystilled: @Narovoid yes, and its been reported. Multiple times
[5:45:04] Shrenko: did you see they revealed a new MMO last night @Towelliee ? at TennoCon
[5:45:04] whyabadi: They are too similar to each other :(
[5:45:07] Bogzeh: is that the mythic or normal version theyre showing?
[5:45:11] Shrenko: announced *
[5:45:13] Mojohusk: The concept art usually has great colour contrast but ingame it looks washed up
[5:45:13] scumlucki: feel bad for the paladins tho lol
[5:45:16] MetriC_TV: Did they change the tauren model?
[5:45:20] blinca: @ProgettazioneInferni oh ok thx!
[5:45:22] KaisenSiru: rock Pog
[5:45:22] Narovoid: @dystilled and that’s all I need to know.
[5:45:22] Rudric_Ice: i adjusted the warrior set just by adding some eyes and to me it looks better
[5:45:22] Wadjaah: No class identity
[5:45:27] NestLucky: hello there
[5:45:31] LightBladeStream: @LawnSpeaker Cool, I also personally have a big problem with the Vault LuL
[5:45:32] Shrenko: its the theme of the expansion
[5:45:32] dec_u: Yoo @Towelliee when do you think will new unit frames arrive? peepoHappy
[5:45:39] adeekoowy: I dont like these open helmets, They should be always closed without showing face.
[5:45:40] Bogzeh: they rly need to get back to class themed sets
[5:45:40] scumlucki: its cause we are primalists
[5:45:40] figsaregood: @BLACKFOOT_TN Weebs yes, furry - WoW is more of a furry game these days
[5:45:45] Cakeabsorber: paladin one looks hilarious though KEKW
[5:45:46] cerealkillas22: there will probably. be more colors
[5:45:51] grumpnamedjosh: They all look like shaman gear
[5:45:55] supersuhmz: i loved the classic tiers because you could distinguish a class just from looking at the character
[5:45:58] ijuki: Isn't that what they did since some expansion ago
[5:45:59] zappylul: The holy rock
[5:45:59] scumlucki: Primalist paladin
[5:46:00] Snabido: Themed around the tier, no?
[5:46:05] memnon94: also not enough colors on the tier sets, looks boring
[5:46:07] tigzie: true, dragon stalker and judgement are both t2, but you can see a difference. tier gear is now all found at the same shop
[5:46:08] Polebegood: i don't really like these raid themed homogenized sets tbh, they just don't work. A rocky themed rogue looks weird, wish they'd go back to more class focused sets
[5:46:08] cerealkillas22: you're gonna be a primal paladin
[5:46:09] abracka_: @ambeonlul LOL
[5:46:10] Dystilled: Transmog?
[5:46:12] Lucixna: pretty sure you are rogue!
[5:46:13] stumper1231: I thought black dragons went extinct
[5:46:17] astrinovska: everyone gets to look like a shaman now
[5:46:18] Thdlock: class fantasy after legion FeelsBadMan
[5:46:20] Shrenko: did you see they announced a new MMO last night @Towelliee ? at TennoCon
[5:46:20] maccaruso: You see costs savings being represented!
[5:46:27] scumlucki: @memnon94 they would probably be re colors
[5:46:30] jay3isme: was it the mythic set we saw?
[5:46:32] BoiAtomico: you're a primaladin Harry
[5:46:32] Cakeabsorber: @BLACKFOOT_TN Just look at the new hogger and tell me which one's a furry game KEKW
[5:46:32] sir_skaeg: cant wait to see evoker set tbh
[5:46:33] BLACKFOOT_TN: @figsaregood  We call them pelts! lol
[5:46:34] Orion280: atleast these tier sets make sense coming from this raid
[5:46:47] Ellycat1: I feel like wotlk started messing this up honestly, a lot of sets no longer looked class specific. peepoSad
[5:46:48] szble: sabellian has been busy
[5:46:52] ShadoodHD: don't blame you tow... then again we can just say "ROCK AND STONE cohhChaos "
[5:46:53] EpicJune: It can be themed, but they went full send with it. all the sets look like Shamans LUL
[5:46:56] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @STK_Lucki (warning)
[5:47:02] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: ugly

[5:53:22] ShadoodHD: oooo i made a good rhyme, brb
[5:53:24] Fafnyir: I'll never say never!
[5:53:25] Gotxiko: 10.x.5 patches need a 1-2 boss raid
[5:53:28] Marts1: What would you think about cutting down bosses in raid to maybe 5-6 and make them more challenging, but with more cosmetic rewards etc?
[5:53:33] tetrahydridodinitrogen: I hope I am wrong but I have a feeling DF will have about the same amount of content as shadowlands.
[5:53:34] Dystilled: We'll have an answer to that aspect of play soon! (TM)
[5:53:35] JoshStrobl: Honestly having expansions with smaller stories but improving the foundation is a good thing to have once in a while. I have been wanting that for years with ESO and High Isle kinda feels that way. Less expansive story, more focus on foundation like performance, account-wide achievements, etc.
[5:53:38] shoelid: not entirely off the table!
[5:53:43] Zettabyte: I want a Rouge Tower this time around Kappa
[5:53:47] scumlucki: What about dragon racing against other players with even a ranked mode
[5:53:50] Rudric_Ice: mage tower will be easy asf in the nxt expac
[5:53:55] BLACKFOOT_TN: I miss Wrath. But I keep remembering all the mining and herbing and rep grinding I had to do back then. Then I remember I detest those things. So I keep talking myself out of playing Wrath classic.
[5:53:57] karter2811: DF already seems slightly more complete
[5:53:59] elandura: don't you hate when you're getting an interview and excited, and you get lawyer's responses instead...
[5:54:10] dec_u: im waiting for actual freakin good PvE awards not that shitty mount from shadowlands, i want the transmogs to come back for doing PvE a lot
[5:54:10] UmbraTheGreat: I want dragonflight to have some raids that are similar to FF14 trails. Like Sartharion single boss raids. Those are fun
[5:54:12] b34v3rbr0: crucible monkaS not again
[5:54:13] ShadoodHD: rogue tower... torghast Kappa
[5:54:17] Gotxiko: sanctum after icc

[5:59:33] ElPolloBatman: because justin sold twitch and they might not have access to that data anymore
[5:59:33] BLACKFOOT_TN: @Towelliee  What sucks about Twitch is that you can sub to a streamer for years. And if you drop your sub for what ever reason. Your sub counter resets to square one.

[6:21:31] scumlucki: dragon glyhps
[6:21:33] catgay13: cool!
[6:21:38] Abyssos05: How does dragonriding feel? is it good?
[6:21:45] Coriollis: is this Los Santos customs POGGERS
[6:22:04] nightmayor12: LMAO
[6:22:11] catgay13: can you change the skin color?
[6:22:11] szble: new drake looks good
[6:22:12] scumlucki: is the drake only available for the blue flight? can we get them in other flight colors?
[6:22:20] ThQbi: Can you change the color of the dragon?
[6:22:32] Coriollis: wait why is the mount blind
[6:22:36] Nokterian: so many options to choose from
[6:22:37] KaisenSiru: Pog
[6:22:40] Steelsky_: I want my own Protodrake :D So eager to collect shit
[6:22:43] Nokterian: every dragon will not look the same
[6:22:44] Gingerprimer: @STK_Lucki other colors and 4 types of dragon skeletons aswell
[6:22:47] scumlucki: lol of course it costs gold too
[6:22:55] stumper1231: how much gold for a cataract operation for your dragon?
[6:22:58] MoobJuices: Now i get to spend thousands of gold mogging my drake while i mog myself.
[6:23:03] ggilgamech: jet dragon sound lol
[6:23:05] Talason: is dragon riding too fast?
[6:23:10] meltingcheese17: @Towelliee how you liking it so far DF?
[6:23:19] akia03: @Towelliee did we find out what those 2 new bits in sw and org where that looked like stables?
[6:23:26] nightmayor12: Top gun simulator POGGERS
[6:23:43] scumlucki: i think the proto drake looks the best out of the 4 models imo
[6:23:50] Pursuit01: They should fix the funny running animations for the mount haha
[6:23:53] sir_skaeg: @Towelliee have u seen the sanghelios dragonriding tech? get your drake to become blue point it straigh up and use the 1 button without using mouse and u will go insanely high
[6:23:54] pilltillkill: i just hope they add actual meaningful content to dragonflight. otherwise its just a form of travel and not really content
[6:24:09] Rudric_Ice: @STK_Lucki they changed the running animation which sucks
[6:24:10] Steelsky_: They are making a lot of new assets too
[6:24:18] LightBladeStream: Maybe the stable is for customizing your dragon in the city
[6:24:20] endsage21: is dragon ground speed 100% or 60%
[6:24:22] Thoreya: Ion said it’s just stuff for the future I believe, didn’t get too into it
[6:24:24] Sarocus: Could be for fast travel. Like an alternative to Ships and zeps?
[6:24:39] Papfar: The tail works now
[6:24:53] sir_skaeg: just use the 1 button once and dont touch right mouse button and u fly very very high
[6:24:54] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:24:54] catgay13: we have chub tail Pog
[6:24:56] CipansR_Ayaya: @pilltillkill I hope they dont leave this system in dust after dragonflight
[6:25:06] whatz_tv: so all old flying mounts are RIP in DF, since they are slow af?
[6:25:18] Rudric_Ice: its a flight path mount tho
[6:25:18] Steelsky_: I hope they add a dragonriding attack to dismount people on PVP :P
[6:25:27] sir_skaeg: yea u poiint ur drake upwards after it goes blueish
[6:25:30] Gingerprimer: @ProgettazioneInferni no
[6:25:34] szble: dragonriding is the flying
[6:25:36] Manabucho: look up
[6:25:40] rusty414: but you look up?
[6:25:42] Tamz_tv: you need the full momentum buff first
[6:25:51] sir_skaeg: yes
[6:26:00] rohdey: aim dargo up, use forward dash to dash upward is what i think they're saying
[6:26:07] LightBladeStream: @Steelsky_ pvp jousting in the air? PogBones
[6:26:10] SupAngrytroll: Propel straight up?
[6:26:12] Gingerprimer: @ProgettazioneInferni but dragonrding is mega fast compared to normal flying
[6:26:14] ArroArroArro: the blue thingy
[6:26:28] rohdey: @Towelliee you have full momentum when you have the Bass Groove effect
[6:26:28] Nokterian: the bar is momentum
[6:26:37] Keyastaron_: yr dragons head will have a blue shining circle
[6:26:47] Official_Dice: It's impossible to be any good and earn gold in this game while having a family and a regular job. You will always be multiple steps behind people like Towelliee and other full time gamers.
[6:26:54] Talason: is this game demanding for a pc?
[6:27:04] Pachez: @REAL_KCOLRAW facts
[6:27:12] ijuki: The instructions are really unclear...
[6:27:13] scumlucki: @Talason i play on a laptop and it runs fine
[6:27:13] Gingerprimer: @Talason not really no
[6:27:16] elandura: @Talason 10 year potatoes play this game.
[6:27:17] BardtheBowman: Getting gold is.
[6:27:20] BardtheBowman: Easy
[6:27:20] SyWr: when you expect to see the release of DF?
[6:27:26] xReadyAimMissx: LUL
[6:27:26] Rudric_Ice: link a video or something
[6:27:31] Coriollis: @Talason no, been same req for almost 5-6 years now
[6:27:35] Sloth_Face: underwater flight Pog
[6:27:39] dudeist42: I don't love the idea of you having to just sit there and wait...just in order to fly?...isn't that going to get annoying?
[6:27:40] CipansR_Ayaya: it cant swim Towelliee
[6:27:41] UmbraTheGreat: @Talason Wow is known for being able to run on toasters. Even a Celeron can run it, just not on max
[6:27:44] xReadyAimMissx: welcome to the new expansion, "Dragonswimming" danKappa
[6:27:45] Talason: i thought this game had rtx
[6:27:46] Steelsky_: @REAL_KCOLRAW You can do your emissaries and what not and be smart on what to sell, you can make a lot of gold without much effort
[6:27:53] donaleks16: do u like the dragonflight feature or is normal flying and stuff better
[6:27:56] scumlucki: @Talason it does
[6:27:57] Talason: ray tracing
[6:28:04] Coriollis: @Talason it has but u cna play with it turned off
[6:28:10] SoLowCash: they're going to have a underwater zone w/ new swimming mounts  BillyApprove
[6:28:10] ijuki: Then you need to hold down right mouse button, otherwise you will not look up
[6:28:10] rohdey: now were cooking with gasoline
[6:28:11] itsindominus38: Are you still trying out alpha @Towelliee
[6:28:15] PadidinJones: Yikes. They should fix that up somehow lol
[6:28:37] itsindominus38: @PadidinJones can you explain please how does the flying work
[6:28:39] CipansR_Ayaya: KEKW
[6:28:41] Snabido: KEKW
[6:28:58] UmbraTheGreat: lmao
[6:29:00] Snabido: It's the pilot, not the dragon
[6:29:04] Talason: does lula like dragonflight so far
[6:29:09] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee but this non-upgraded dragon riding. Will probably gain more stamina and whatnot via levelling
[6:29:14] xReadyAimMissx: @Talason just some ray tracing shadows is all.
[6:29:28] PadidinJones: @PadidinJones Its like the goblin glider with controls
[6:29:32] itsindominus38: I think its cool tbh
[6:29:39] jack11040: I feel like people forget that its level 1 dragonriding
[6:29:43] UmbraTheGreat: Think they will unlock all standard classes for all races? can we finally make Blood elf shamans or something?
[6:29:48] Exoduc: They also say dragon riding is not meant to replace ordinary flying, it is its own thing, much faster too if you do it right
[6:29:54] zenkaigo_: why dont they just put updraft in places people can get stuck
[6:30:00] itsindominus38: @PadidinJones So how do you go up
[6:30:05] Keyastaron_: when it's upgraded we should have unlimited momentom and it doesn't descend when stationary
[6:30:11] dudeist42: oh so you can regen your energy while flying?
[6:30:13] EpicJune: i feel you should be able to fly normally, but if you want to go quicker then you dragon fly imho
[6:30:13] ggilgamech: does not feel 100%
[6:30:22] Gingerprimer: @Greatthona they said they try and do more of it even if some combos require more lore ground work
[6:30:26] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee If you're going by the GW2 gryphon riding, then starter gryphon is way way more different from fully upgraded gryphon
[6:30:45] PadidinJones: @PadidinJones I think there is a wing flap command. Think of those glider parachutes. Forget what they are called
[6:30:47] 3dRes: Would be awesome if the wings flapped whilst in ground form. Just acting like a normal mount is goofy
[6:30:49] Sarocus: Azure Span is confirmed to be the biggest zone in the game so far
[6:30:52] MrCheshireCat_: 6
[6:30:53] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @sir_skaeg (warning)
[6:31:14] solegs100: it looks like stamina bars
[6:31:18] Zayzii: @Sarocus only from expansion zones i think
[6:31:25] UmbraTheGreat: @Gingerprimer I honestly dont care about the lore for classes, just want a good looking druid or shaman. Some restrictions makes sense like Demon Hunter since its a hero class
[6:31:31] g3orgedaniel: LUL LUL LUL
[6:31:32] itsindominus38: KEKW
[6:31:33] SuperBrotendo: flying mount was my nickname in college
[6:31:36] Talason: if they implement dragon riding in raids some how, do you feel like certain people would fail
[6:31:37] Vnvqt_: Having played most Alphas ( I'm guessing ) Would you say this one is far deeper in development compared to lets say, Shadowlands and BFA?
[6:31:37] Winter7735: LUL
[6:31:45] Nevindaz: KEKW
[6:31:45] Official_Dice: @REAL_KCOLRAW The game is more than just making gold. Earning Achievements, Gear, Honor, Mounrs and so on.. There is just not enough time in the day to keep upp with the game. This game is made for fulltime gamers and teens. sorry to say.
[6:31:46] sir_skaeg: mods, can i be permitted to post a link so towellie can see the speed dragon tech?
[6:31:49] Gingerprimer: @Greatthona take that up with blizzard ;)
[6:31:52] Ooshraxa: @Towelliee yeah, exactly. The WoW version looks very very good

[6:32:30] Expanding: LUL
[6:32:32] abracka_: "yo ion wake up i can't login"
[6:32:32] Thoreya: Ion sounded pretty confident in the wowcrendor interview that it’s gonna come out this year
[6:32:34] Balkep: logging in as a different character might help
[6:32:35] SoLowCash: @REAL_KCOLRAW  RainTime
[6:32:38] Streamcrush: they're not just done, they're functioning
[6:32:44] Gooseberries: Have you tried deleting your WTF folder?
[6:32:51] mortality092: you dont star leveling from 60? you start from 65?
[6:32:51] Sleyenda_UK: log on another toon then back to the rogue
[6:32:59] fantomas_the_rogue: @Gingerprimer undead druids would be cool af
[6:33:01] sir_skaeg: @Towelliee how can i be permitted to post a link so u can see the dragon riding tech to fly high
[6:33:05] Gingerprimer: @mortality092 on the alpha yes
[6:33:08] SeventyxSev7n: I think the date that got leaked was a mistake, imo we get a delay.
[6:33:11] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @YoggSlothod (warning)
[6:33:13] SeventyxSev7n: and get the game mid feb
[6:33:15] ggilgamech: the zones are empty too
[6:33:18] redbulladin: Tow the new dracthyr what armor do they wear is it leather? or mail?
[6:33:23] fewyn: captain placeholder all over the place
[6:33:25] killmatix: remember last week of wod beta and the dark portal wasnt fully textured
[6:33:29] Gingerprimer: @redbulladin mail
[6:33:29] Cooky_28: @redbulladin Mail
[6:33:30] Towelliee: !permit sir_skaeg
[6:33:30] Moobot: @Towelliee @sir_skaeg will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Towelliee)
[6:33:30] Manabucho: anyone have linked imfiredups clip of the flight hack?
[6:33:35] YoggSlothod: Tauren rogue???? WHAT ?
[6:33:35] sir_skaeg: https://clips.twitch.tv/BlindingAntediluvianSeahorseKlappa-pQDSVsOArrEKbLCQ
[6:33:37] Gooseberries: And don't forget to disable any pesky addons!
[6:33:38] UmbraTheGreat: @redbulladin Mail
[6:33:47] Attackroot: Feel reaver in tbc alpha was a bear
[6:33:49] redbulladin: @Gingerprimer ty
[6:33:53] holiweird: Gilneas theme is so good
[6:33:55] redbulladin: @Greatthona ty
[6:33:56] KaisenSiru: Pog
[6:33:58] Cooky_28: Wtf
[6:34:11] scumlucki: thats 100 percent egtting patched
[6:34:18] solegs100: but thats also a concern because it could be lazy devs if the zones are done so soon
[6:34:20] Manabucho: probably a bug
[6:34:21] moa285: POGGERS AngelThump
[6:34:26] 클라우센: fun detected
[6:34:34] Gingerprimer: Yeah looks like not intended
[6:34:38] Pursuit01: that nullifies the 2 ability so its getting patched
[6:34:40] Thoreya: @solegs100 or they’re just ahead of schedule lol
[6:34:45] JoshStrobl: That seems more like a bug
[6:34:57] Balkep: i-frames on the momentum to defy gravity LUL
[6:35:01] sir_skaeg: yea no clue why it works but it looks insane xD
[6:35:05] Gotxiko: pressing 1 might confuse the game and not trigger the "im going up"
[6:35:18] solegs100: @Thoreya in how many years have the devs been ahead of the game LUL
[6:35:27] KaisenSiru: Treats Pog
[6:35:30] Aquadriel: how is lazy devs if zones are done?
[6:35:37] emarol_dk: Im so hyped for dragonflight.
[6:35:38] scumlucki: they said they been working o dragonflight before shadowlands which i dont believe at all
[6:35:39] DennisTried: good afternoon, towel and towel enjoyers
[6:35:48] Gingerprimer: @solegs100 in Legion they were clearly ahead of schedule
[6:35:57] Inzidious: @solegs100 so soon?? they have been working on it for over 2 years
[6:35:58] khlaah: I resubbed recently, finished getting vulpera opened up and leveling a bm hunter again, been a long ass time
[6:35:59] nightst314: that logic xD
[6:36:01] aleksmetha: he said it?
[6:36:02] holiweird: So with dragon riding you can just fly up like you used to? Do you need momentum before hand?
[6:36:02] Queenjii: No such thing as 'lazy devs' just understaffed or underpaid
[6:36:04] fantomas_the_rogue: what is too quickly, it's been 2 years, isn't this their usual schedule?
[6:36:07] Exoduc: same size as northrend, which had 10 zones if you count crystalsong forest, dragon isles just have 5 including a small starter zone
[6:36:11] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @itsindominus38 (warning)
[6:36:13] soulshunter876: shadowlands is a patch
[6:36:15] elandura: What happened to shadowlands makes much more sense after this :D
[6:36:16] antphilosophy: huge doesn't equal good, trust me
[6:36:17] Rudric_Ice: so they already knew that SL was gonna suck Kappa
[6:36:17] JoshStrobl: Art teams are able to work asynchronously to much of the other development
[6:36:18] Manabucho: wait so they knew SL was gonna be not optimal....
[6:36:20] Aquadriel: still such a dumb train of thought lol
[6:36:21] scumlucki: wait i thought syndragosa was a dude
[6:36:22] Streamcrush: Can we ban "lazy devs" from the gamer catch phrase sheet?
[6:36:22] Sniqi: Azure Span has this Northrend feeling and Northrend was just awesome
[6:36:22] Vattss: @Towelliee Does it actually matters if the zone is huge? we got big zones like the maw which is big and all, but does it really means it's good?
[6:36:35] Cooky_28: Oh, so they knew that Shadowlands gonna be bad.
[6:36:43] BlackCl0ud: i feel people are trying to nitpick and make up bad things about the game right now
[6:36:45] NYKO7_: does Blizzard still have a team in EU? Or that was canceled?
[6:36:53] khlaah: Going through WoD with my Vulpera hunter, the nostalgia with the garrison lol
[6:37:03] pilltillkill: @BlackCl0ud after the past few xpacs, i think thats pretty fair. the bar is high at this point
[6:37:06] zysmos: devs literally can't win, it doesn't come fast enough people are mad it comes too quickly it's rushed and people are mad LUL
[6:37:08] dalaraz: i get more legion vibes than northrend tbh
[6:37:09] Thdlock: and on live after season 4 they will be 310 LUL
[6:37:13] scumlucki: your luck is just bad
[6:37:20] Vattss: @Towelliee Does it actually matters if the zone is huge? we got big zones like the maw which is big and all, but does it really means it's good??
[6:37:27] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:37:28] MrClaudeSeaburn: 310 with the new season
[6:37:29] Raddest: @Towelliee bro, season 4 is bumping up iLVL again, don't forget that
[6:37:30] catgay13: well yes, but we still have 1 tier left
[6:37:31] Niconatelver: @Thdlock True NotLikeThis
[6:37:31] Arviu90: @Towelliee I rly hope that the evokers soar ability 5min CD will me deleted or greatly reduced. seems weird to be a dragon with wings and not able to perma flight.
[6:37:31] patrick_19991: which is very safd
[6:37:31] ashwing_: You are forgetting S4
[6:37:31] Gingerprimer: @Manateedk it is mostly art teams that were working on DF early prob since the art takes the longest
[6:37:32] elandura: @Towelliee you're forgeting S4 Shadowlands
[6:37:33] patrick_19991: sad
[6:37:35] Keyastaron_: no stat squish either more numberssss
[6:37:40] hoguuuuuu: thats good
[6:37:40] vladtepes490: you know you can upgrade your basic gear at the ilvl upgrade guy in Oribos
[6:37:49] Keyastaron_: yeah @towelliee  season 4 too
[6:37:49] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee also season 4 gear
[6:37:51] luke238: i took my heart of azeroth into the first 2 weeks of cn
[6:37:52] Rudric_Ice: SMOrc SMOrc
[6:37:53] BlackCl0ud: a hefty chonker
[6:37:54] BardtheBowman: I don’t think he is implying big means good
[6:38:08] holiweird: tauren rogues lol. Pirate one makes sense though
[6:38:11] Keyastaron_: yeah I don't see us changing gear til last zone
[6:38:12] Niconatelver: dont prepatch usually give higher ilvl gear too?
[6:38:15] Phanopov: 311 OWS GIGACHAD
[6:38:17] Anzel_1: fated old warrior soul
[6:38:19] shadowhun1r: @Towelliee u can create a shaman and use longsight to see the other zonens in df
[6:38:32] DennisTried: Invisabull, now I get it :D
[6:38:32] NYKO7_: what about legendaries? Will we be upgrading them?
[6:38:38] CommanderKrano: i hope they do the same with old raids that they do now with old m+ dungeons. in each season one old raid back into the rotation with current ilvls and stuff
[6:38:40] fantomas_the_rogue: @keyastaron_ they are the most deadly, you NEVER used to see them. until now...
[6:38:43] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @Vattss (warning)
[6:38:52] Gingerprimer: @NYKO7_ prob yrd
[6:38:57] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee you think they'll up the ilvl? I feel like its to low with S4 ilvl jump
[6:38:58] PraetorFTW: @Towelliee he does not say BOO! he sais MOO! when he gets out of the stealth !
[6:39:03] aleksmetha: we can upgrade them to max level right? even if we dont raid mythic?
[6:39:05] Keyastaron_: @fantomas_the_rogue hmm?
[6:39:10] TheGaoSora: wait, taurens can be rogues now? coxPog
[6:39:13] akia03: how much are they buffing the raids tho in s4
[6:39:14] holiweird: Its even more strange because in the lore taurens are much much larger than they do appear in game.
[6:39:15] BardtheBowman: I liked the tank think from kael
[6:39:15] BlackCl0ud: the iailer
[6:39:16] infinityarty: skipping p3 entirely?
[6:39:19] elandura: 310 kelthuzad wep and 310 jailer wep+ 310 old warr  soul... fury warriors are gonna be puuuuummmmping :D
[6:39:21] scumlucki: @PraetorFTW thats even more terrifying lol
[6:39:23] Gingerprimer: @ProgettazioneInferni might ad the trinket not effective about level 60 thing
[6:39:25] nightst314: @Towelliee the 2hand mace got buffed this week and it's be absolutely nuts at 311
[6:39:25] No_Logic1123: not throwing shade but how does someone go from eso to wow. that character movement is so slow i fall asleep.
[6:39:29] Cooky_28: Wish I could get Jailer curve but no gt, sad. At least in Dragonflight trying to get all of them. :)
[6:39:29] fantomas_the_rogue: I misquoted sorry about that @keyastaron_
[6:39:30] Thdlock: @infinityarty, u cant it auto pushes at 30
[6:39:35] Anzel_1: Taurens have ALWAYS been able to be rogues Kappa we just never saw them until now
[6:39:37] Secondbreakfasttt: that name awesome btw LUL
[6:39:40] BlackCl0ud: to be fair, taurens have been rogues since before Vanilla
[6:39:52] SeventyxSev7n: thats how it should be tho
[6:39:56] Keyastaron_: nms @fantomas_the_rogue

[6:40:21] rohdey: maybe thats the idea for people who don't play s4 SL?
[6:40:22] Aquadriel: thats usually the case, you start changing gear around normal dungeons if you mythic raid
[6:40:27] UmbraTheGreat: Taurens were always the best rogues. They just got sloppy lately. Now you can see them :)
[6:40:27] scumlucki: thats a cool looking sword
[6:40:33] BlackCl0ud: he getting rekt
[6:40:36] Aquadriel: hc and normal players do start using lvling gear
[6:40:38] HindenbergZA: Can't remember, do they normally implement the new classes into pre-patch?
[6:40:52] AlexTsar95: ää'
[6:40:53] holiweird: @SarielZA yes
[6:40:55] Risantos: PvP gear will go over 300 Ilvl too in season 4
[6:40:58] CheckYourFax: i think blizz is careful with ilvls for the xpack before we get another weird situation like in MoP
[6:41:07] Gudihr: @SarielZA Dh was implemented yeah
[6:41:10] manmower: how are the stat allocations? are we gonna at least get a big drop in secondaries?
[6:41:10] HindenbergZA: @Ogidormu Nice, fanx!
[6:41:16] rusty414: rogue talents in alpha?
[6:41:20] Sniqi: @Towelliee Is there any information about the unlock requirements for Dracthyr?
[6:41:29] holiweird: Are we getting recolours or new sets for season 4?
[6:41:37] scumlucki: @Sniqi think you need a lvl 60
[6:41:44] Rudric_Ice: will S4 get a glad mount or na ?
[6:41:57] PadidinJones: @Towelliee are they currently nerfing XP?
[6:42:01] Snabido: Expansion
[6:42:03] Snabido: Prolly
[6:42:10] TheItalianStallion321: you need a level 50 on your server to start 1. @Sniqi
[6:42:14] TheItalianStallion321: thats about it
[6:42:22] TheGaoSora: can dragon riding be used in any other zones outside of dragon isles?
[6:42:27] ggilgamech: too slow
[6:42:27] Cooky_28: It was a bug then

[6:42:33] Delusiom: I hate how they weapon lock rogue specs can you e
[6:42:35] ggilgamech: you lost the blue buff
[6:42:35] thaurman: any explanation why would a drakchtyr join the alliance or horde?
[6:42:36] Vattss: @Towelliee maybe they fixed the bug
[6:42:47] Sniqi: @TheItalianStallion321 Uh cool thanks
[6:42:49] holiweird: best WoD soundtrack
[6:42:51] itsindominus38: So is dragonflying only gonna be in dragonflight or in other zones ?
[6:42:55] Keyastaron_: @towelliee what you think the system requirements will be for dragon flight
[6:42:57] scumlucki: i think he pointed upwards let go of right click then press 1 and then hold right click upwards again
[6:42:58] vulkox666: so how come all the talents for classes aint out on the dragonflight talent calculator if alpha out>?
[6:42:59] iLAMARIO: i think he did a 2 button there, just as he turned up
[6:43:05] Niconatelver: Towelliee how long would it take to walk across the new zone on normal mount?
[6:43:11] steldam: HUNTER time!!!!

[6:43:29] itsindominus38: So is dragonflying only gonna be in dragonflight or in other zones chat
[6:43:34] iLAMARIO: was it really a 1, cause it moved wings more than 1
[6:43:37] ser3n1ty_: how does the pvp talents work ?
[6:43:43] Delusiom: also can you use mutilate with swords?
[6:43:58] HeBeDead: does anyone know if i have to purchase shadowlands to play dragonflight? how will i level my toons if i didnt play SL?
[6:44:02] JMatherz9: Can you change talents anywhere or is it still in rested zones? @Towelliee
[6:44:09] Cooky_28: @Towelliee what do you think of Evoker?
[6:44:17] zarrzxtv: no assa is locked to double daggers unless you dont want to mutilate
[6:44:19] scumlucki: @HeBeDead you have to buy dragonflight to play dragonflight
[6:44:24] cbates30: @Towelliee when you think we see shaman and monk ?
[6:44:28] Juton09: Wish there was a tank spec for Evoker
[6:44:32] SoLowCash: @HeBeDead Nah you won't have to buy SL and DF should come w/ a boost
[6:44:36] paprickan: does transmog even work for evokers?
[6:44:36] BardtheBowman: They said maybe other zones later
[6:44:36] Pursuit01: What a great belt you have on lol
[6:44:38] Cooky_28: Glad that dragonfly is available anywhere for Drakthyr. :D
[6:44:38] Delusiom: what about backstab with swords?
[6:44:43] scumlucki: never understood why they give casters weapons when they never use them
[6:44:43] Stawnchy: That belt though
[6:44:43] zickmagames: how long does it take to level from 60-70?
[6:44:47] Copsonson: The belt looks strange
