[3:27:00] EngeltheFallen: practice though for mc
[3:27:09] uVeins: do mobs ever respawn in there?
[3:27:12] Stealthtoucan: ah I see

[3:28:27] uVeins: probably not the best place to ask but; why isn't soda streaming his pov?
[3:28:42] PaperbackWritter: so MC then AQ40? Pog
[3:28:43] Kitkitten_: Sometimes he doesn't stream it
[3:28:45] Kitkitten_: idk why
[3:28:59] uVeins: maybe he like to focus on these
[3:28:59] Kitkitten_: He was streaming a lot earlier
[3:29:05] Kitkitten_: maybe
[3:29:23] MrDropTheSoap: Penis
[3:29:49] Eatingtime: @uVeins when he went offline an hour ago said he wanted to do some stuff to prepare for seasons of discovery off stream
[3:29:50] PaperbackWritter: it is probably a bit of focusing + letting the other otk members getting viewers

[3:30:57] heskitgel: being a HC healer must be so fuckin stressful lol
[3:31:02] Eatingtime: @itzzzcodyy but soda saaid they arent sure if they will run MC only for a bit or not
[3:31:06] PaperbackWritter: he is scared that the guild will be wipe after mc Sadge
[3:31:16] EngeltheFallen: some will do other stuff, but 40 man raids are hard to keep up at the best of times
[3:31:20] itzzzcodyy: yeah thats what i thought but i thought i heard something about that. my bad
[3:31:38] Kudunk: PartyHat Party Time
[3:31:41] itzzzcodyy: gotcha
[3:31:51] KingMcNastyy: With how many people that have not done MC before, I could see people getting eachother killed
[3:31:59] KayTeaHolmes: MC will be do or die honestly, idk if they will make it through AQ40
[3:32:08] KayTeaHolmes: If they do make it through MC
[3:32:11] EngeltheFallen: yeah that is the biggest thing, no one knows how a 40 man will go yet
[3:32:24] windpillows: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[3:32:31] EngeltheFallen: they waffle stomp mc then yeah they will go on most likely
[3:32:39] PaperbackWritter: can you do a macro do activate it available then cast frostbolt after?
[3:32:42] EngeltheFallen: they could also lost half the group
[3:32:44] butlerlog: Stuff like living bomb will be scary. There are no practice runs
[3:32:50] KayTeaHolmes: ^
[3:32:54] Draleric: monkaW
[3:33:00] KayTeaHolmes: Thats what im scared of honestly

[3:33:24] EngeltheFallen: he is just chillin
[3:33:29] cetnam: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[3:33:40] bodli1125: i see more problems when they want to run bwl if they even want thath
[3:33:45] Draleric: cobaltEZ
[3:33:57] uVeins: was that smoothMcgroove?
[3:34:02] EngeltheFallen: bwl is a smaller group which is easier to manage
[3:34:21] KayTeaHolmes: I think they will try bwl, but the mechs in there can go south so fast
[3:34:24] Stealthtoucan: I thought BWL was 40 as well?
[3:34:25] bodli1125: as far as i remember is bwl 40 too ?
[3:34:25] uVeins: he's been psoting new videos recently, so happy about it
[3:34:34] Fanrogh: the back is ok , not sure what you have
[3:34:38] Linnuck: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!
[3:34:47] Fanrogh: ring is good
[3:35:16] Fanrogh: the weapon is good but you need exalted for it and you'll get better by that time
[3:35:16] EngeltheFallen: oh shit it is a 40 will in classic
[3:35:19] EngeltheFallen: my bad
[3:35:36] itzzzcodyy: thats what i thought too. and the first boss alone is a very interesting fight
[3:35:39] KayTeaHolmes: Yeah BWL classic is scary AF
[3:35:41] butlerlog: Bwl has some resist gear requirements right?
[3:35:44] Moxgoat: PartyHat Happy Partner anniversary!

[3:37:32] Starpaul: warlock is not good damage in dungeons?
[3:37:51] Stealthtoucan: @butlerlog https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=15138/onyxia-scale-cloak is required for some bosses
[3:37:59] butlerlog: I remember watching my brother tank this event in vanilla
[3:38:11] EngeltheFallen: for some reason not many lock in this guild
[3:38:14] Eatingtime: warlock is very good @Starpaul i think at least
[3:38:31] EngeltheFallen: half the guild is warriors or rogue
[3:38:42] bodli1125: yep scale cloak is must have for bwl
[3:38:45] Starpaul: only one in the party
[3:38:53] EngeltheFallen: they are not guild <.<
[3:38:56] Fanrogh: he had a shield on
[3:39:04] Draleric: Starpaul warlocks gear isnt that great https://classicwowarmory.com/character/us/defias-pillager/eurobeat
[3:39:06] fattmab: rogue and warrior are pretty easy to make hit cap and do good dps
[3:39:15] kaisnipplez: this is so chill

[3:39:29] Draleric: ilvl 52 compared to cobalts ilvl 62 cobaltEZ
[3:39:42] EngeltheFallen: locks will be needed for 40 mans if they want to start anywhere near on time
[3:39:43] Starpaul: ahh
[3:39:56] EngeltheFallen: and mau need banish

[3:42:05] Draleric: PepeLaugh
[3:42:19] Eatingtime: @uVeins tanks do great dps in classic cause they are specced to deal damage, cause damage equals threat...or something like that. im regurgitating what I have heard
[3:42:26] EngeltheFallen: in classic tanks do a lot ton of damage
[3:42:27] Chop_buster: isn't fire technically better in this phase of the game?
[3:42:29] sol9110: i thought classic already did AQ40
[3:42:33] EngeltheFallen: that is why everyone wants to play warrior
[3:42:39] sol9110: is this new content?
[3:42:52] EngeltheFallen: this is Aq20
[3:43:02] bodli1125: in 20 raids they do great dmg later in mc and co they need great resistan gear then the dps drops a littel
[3:43:06] EngeltheFallen: AQ40 is a tier 2.5 40 man raid
[3:43:10] SgtKeeneye: I have to pay my viewer back after borrowing 100g for the Makgora tourny and dying LUL i feel so indebted right now
[3:43:12] KayTeaHolmes: No this is patrick
[3:43:13] PaperbackWritter: need a macro to do it with frost bolt NODDERS
[3:43:15] uVeins: And i guess ppl cant just go all tanks because then the mob agro would be too unpredictable correct?
[3:43:55] EngeltheFallen: they could in theory but some bosses with AOE attacks would massacre the raid
[3:44:05] uVeins: oh ok
[3:44:06] Stealthtoucan: @uVeins more for balanced buffs and utility, you need polymorph and such
[3:44:11] Kitkitten_: Lifting Lifting Lifting
[3:44:17] dapyman: You guys got this on farm now
[3:44:21] uVeins: makes sense thx guys
[3:44:22] butlerlog: Love how hardcore makes even 20 main characters be calm on coms
[3:44:23] EngeltheFallen: but this will be a big thing coming up as some top guys are just not raiding in MC
[3:44:35] EngeltheFallen: they cannot bring dozens of warriors
[3:44:39] KayTeaHolmes: If your looking at a speedruning guild in classic, they will have more warrs than not
[3:44:46] KayTeaHolmes: but you need other classes
[3:44:51] fattmab: you need utility abilities in MC
[3:44:55] Eatingtime: most of the warriors dojnt want the responsibilty of tanking, they just want the benefits of p[umping huge damage
[3:45:02] bodli1125: and fire resist gear

[3:46:49] uVeins: whats an offtanks job?
[3:46:53] bodli1125: they prop the same as pala just there to buff
[3:46:53] PaperbackWritter: what about a million times + 1 :)
[3:46:55] fattmab: druid tanking doesn't become really viable until wotlk and later.
[3:47:08] EngeltheFallen: offtanks tank different groups
[3:47:15] EngeltheFallen: and tanks if the main tank is controled
[3:47:16] fattmab: offtanks handle adds, or some mobs have to have tank switches due to abilities or debuffs.
[3:47:17] EngeltheFallen: or stunned
[3:47:18] Rionok: well seems you're long overdue for 1000001th
[3:47:20] Eatingtime: @kaisnipplez my understanding is that they can be very good and main tank most bosses, but some bosses will require a warrior specifically becuase they have better defensive cooldowns
