[0:53:54] Arctic_Reigns: i watvh streams so i can see adds
[0:53:54] Srymm: i think subbing to one streamer should make no ads for any streamer, you're paying enough already to outweigh you wathcing ads
[0:53:54] Staff_1A: Why are people complaining about getting ads for free entertainment? Thats how its always been. You pay to avoid ads on here like anywhere else
[0:53:54] DontKermitSueSide: twitch should just limit the quality of non subs streams to 720p

[0:53:59] flyhigh147: GL with that, twich would die in a day
[0:54:00] Namouz: @sodapoppin have twitch prime have the option of a free sub OR turbo per month
[0:54:00] vireliquus: is this game fun?

[0:54:26] Delta3388: TRUE
[0:54:28] SAFCdan95: $1 a month to watch 1080p
[0:54:28] wickednafi: @Cptn_chromo like make the chat smaller and roll an ad or two through. Or just completely block the chat for the ad. But then it becomes a problem thing for ads with sounds.

[1:01:54] Longhumans: @sodapoppin Contractually make streamers run ads but let them choose when. Allows both streamers and viewers to essentially have food/water breaks while also appeasing twitch. Ads exist and won't go away, forcing them at random will just hurt twitch/viewers/streamers over time.

[5:27:40] TaseMeBro_: @Shadoman268 the bosses heals when one of the others die

[5:30:09] WayILive: they have the mana to overheal all they want now
[5:30:09] Hubsy: @Shauzyfx chat has only been commenting about the healers, also people who have never been here are streaming and have their chats too, so that doesn't help your case
[5:30:09] Zero2774: I dunno man, You need more resto shamans

[5:30:13] Calhob: half of some healers healing was over healing
[5:30:14] TheZetsy: qtpie PogChamp
[5:30:14] Hinderhoof: bad fight for a druid healer. at least untill near the end.
[5:30:14] zexx0: @FreezeMage_ Clearly you don't
[5:30:16] Agmaran: @rahaain twitch lowers quality for adblock users now cause they want to kill their platform
[5:30:17] beamishhhhh: You have so much over heal so get rid of healers
[5:30:19] Phatality99: nope
[5:30:20] Pizide: you guys stopped to gain mana
[5:30:21] Lysheski: not incredibly bad at all
[5:30:22] draxxt__: Does healing done calculate based on effective healing? (meaning not involving over healing)
[5:30:24] SparkyAccount: overhealing only matters for priests for this fight

[5:30:29] Arvsta: yes, because ur wasting healing which could be damage instead
[5:30:30] IBBolin: yes, its still wasted time
[5:30:30] Hubsy: @Shauzyfx all i'm saying is he can mention how many healers they have, as it doesn't even involve tactics, not that he knows them anyways'

[5:30:32] matteian: for a holy priest nah
[5:30:32] Ragabosh: Healers taking mana breaks during the fight is kind of a bad thing
[5:30:32] manaversel: that means you need way more healers than you need
[5:30:33] dekcoLSA: 9 healers pogchamp
[5:30:33] Rofyx: It's just pointless healing that could have been dps instead
[5:30:34] Xurkan: it means healers are not healing the ppl they should?
[5:30:34] petamenos: pepeJAM
[5:30:34] Sixpoint: it doesn't matter as much this fight
[5:30:34] yggdrasil_gi: @rahaain Twitch does that to people using an ad blocker now.
[5:30:35] SoraIRL: the overheal is because they are constantly AOE healing
[5:30:35] dearestplums: Overhealing only matters if healers are running out of mana
[5:30:36] chris5528: Pog Pog Pog
[5:30:37] dontlookatthisxd: no they are not close to ooming at all
[5:30:38] postitnote90: only a waste of mana if they are oom

[5:30:42] 14nerf: It's normal for disco priest to do a lot of overheal, no clue what they're talking about
[5:30:43] FreedSpeaks: he's right it's a dps check
[5:30:43] noewon: yes if u need more dps u swap to dps

[5:30:45] ToastarN: @sodapoppin, how do you do this fight
[5:30:45] Bublo: overhealing only matters to healers that can never top charts and want to brag about how efficient it is to be bad

[5:30:50] Brynkle: @sodapoppin - Why not kill them at the same time?
[5:30:50] TIGERu: 2 of those healers should be dps
[5:30:51] instant_win: Yes it’s a dps race need more dps
[5:30:52] dontlookatthisxd: their problem is not being able to cast fast enough to outheal the DoT
[5:30:52] Trypticc: Overhealing is dps loss
[5:30:52] Chavawien: g
[5:30:57] Tokes14: why can't you get all three to 20% then execute them all within a short period of eachother?
[5:30:57] Dhrenzen: QT goes OOM every fight LULW
[5:30:59] Slip: ah yes of course, dps doesnt matter
[5:31:01] thedarkdh: soda knows lol but need raid to figure it out
[5:31:02] Theixion: They're literally saying stop so they can use their helm to regen mana, so yes it does matter PepeLaugh

[5:31:10] G0rami: SODAING
[5:31:12] Weirdowz: have they realised the buff gives insane bonus dps? sacrificing a dps warrior to taunt grab the debuff and swap tank back for bonus dps is insane on here
[5:31:12] Kael88: He gets a stack regardless of range
[5:31:13] eggs_boiled: how did previous bosses go ? worse or better?
[5:31:13] Jingosu: its a dps race encou8nter, untill steelbreaker its just chill interupts and management, looong enrage timer
[5:31:13] alphex2: vigor is too calm
[5:31:14] Maenster: they need about this many healers cuz they don't have healing cooldowns

[5:46:11] AngularDrift: I do personally think AoC will make blizzard realise they might need to step up their game.
[5:46:12] MilkshakeMoo: @dezignat3 so it actually increases his Single Target damage
[5:46:12] ursavolta: why dont you do the kitin method again? it's better to heal you, freeing up a tank/dps and ave everyone dps the shit out of boss in the last phase

[5:46:23] paccz: The static disruption will only be cast on a ranged, if steelbreaker can`t find a ranged target he will target anyone near him, so someone have to bait the debuff outside where they should stack up. This way, only one gets the debuff and no dps or heal should die
[5:46:24] Drea7x: how many attempts has it been
[5:46:25] anjin89: small - medium - big boss for rune of power on big guy?

[5:48:12] paperbirdd: the only part that is hard mode is leaving the big one last you can swap the smaller 2
[5:48:14] Summerville: I think you have 1 minute to kill Steelbreaker, untilll enrage
[5:48:14] airnotes: you can do it if u cut players
[5:48:16] KorbenDallas815: chance, is the boss 'bugged' in the same way patchwerk was or not?

[6:04:35] brentman94: No, chat the deciding factor will be once they realize they can have a dps taunt and take the debuff the tank has in p3. It kills you after a certain amount of time, but it gives you a huge dps bonus

[7:14:19] bwestrush: Who keeps LAUGHING???? THEy are hilarious
[7:14:21] ChrizzQQ: @sodapoppin If you want healing to be easier have everyone stack near steelbreaker and rotate range players out to soak the spark since it hits the range person if everyone is stacked in his melee ( makes it easier to heal and preshield target ), also healing debuffs work when meltdown occurs to lower the healing amount. Other then that its just a matter of doing more dps SirO out
[7:14:23] plutarr: use paladin tanks, pop divine shield when the debuff is about to expire, keep tank, when you get new one, do the normal strat, swap in fresh pally and repeat

[8:30:28] sngtokos: @sodapoppin if u leave only 1 person on ranged and everyone else stacks the boss will only throw the lightning orb on that person. All u have to do is rotate healers/hunters in and out of melee range to soak the orb and its dead.
[8:30:29] shadow_vamp: the dps has to taunt for the first Meltdown yes? they dont have dbm for 2nd Meltdown CD
[8:30:36] gobbleractually: have they tried the kite strat?
[8:30:44] fusion_sciter: Have tanks hearth out before debuff gets to 0. Have other tank pick it up. That way he won’t get buff. You will be able to get him to 0

[8:31:35] fsdgdfhd: @sodapoppin i believe that 24 brewmasters with qt healing will beat this boss
[8:31:35] Mohagany: WHY DO THEY HAVE SO MANY HEALERS LOOOL
[8:31:36] lifehardtiddysoft: @discomania because every time they get on the topic of changing healers to dps they get sidetracked
[8:31:36] DecayedRA: 5% prob 9% was a waste
[8:31:39] Demokrit: hey mr streamer i think you can meet the dps check if you add a few more healers :)
