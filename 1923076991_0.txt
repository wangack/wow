[0:23:11] twstedslap: Hello there
[0:23:34] Chipi_qc: He agreed to the makgora, that's not stream snipe
[0:23:54] hardstyler9: 4 rows ? l2 count
[0:24:06] SilkeySmooth: thats true swifty
[0:24:07] mynameisdone: He did use detect magic on him, thats why he can see the buffs
[0:24:09] BartoPlaysGames: Mage has Detect Magic skill :)
[0:24:18] JohnnyRain: swiftyNom
[0:24:18] SilkeySmooth: its not a stream snipe
[0:24:29] Chipi_qc: That's not harassment
[0:24:32] Pallyofhell: It's someone trying to cheese
[0:24:36] mynameisdone: its is a streamsnipe
[0:24:37] jdane: if its not a stream snipe its a sweat snipe
[0:24:39] Ev0hz: most obvious case of stream sniping I have ever seen LUL
[0:24:52] Hyelander_: Duel cant be a stream snipe, because you have to consent
[0:24:55] SilkeySmooth: how is agreeing to a duel to the death a stream snipe?
[0:25:05] CheesemaneTV: ^
[0:25:06] Chipi_qc: But ziqo agreed to the mak gora
[0:25:06] BartoPlaysGames: its a snipe a cheese and its the most obvious way o trying to grief @Swifty
[0:25:09] jdane: hes watching his stream
[0:25:10] Duraz: he pre buffed specifically for a duel with a mage.... unless there is another mage in the area he was about to duel....
[0:25:12] jdane: its a snipe
[0:25:13] Maskedoutlaw: This is the most obvious stream sniper ive ever seen and the proof is all of sniper streaming it himself
[0:25:16] LykkLee: its ziqo who made the duel
[0:25:18] hardstyler9: ofc not
[0:25:18] Kleerhanger: definitely a stream snipe
[0:25:18] The_Crafty_DM: 100% snipe
[0:25:21] moziklol: the real stream snipe was the friends we made along the way
[0:25:26] optikek: ofc it was
[0:25:28] walcolive: stop pausing plz, let us just see it
[0:25:36] shasvre123: hola swifty si estaba haciendo snipe!!
[0:25:40] jdane: unfair advantage by screen watching
[0:25:43] SilkeySmooth: so agreeing to a duel to the death is a stream snipe ok
[0:25:45] Pallyofhell: It was planned. I wouldn't say 100% a snipe
[0:25:47] walcolive: oh lol
[0:25:49] PazokiTV: It‚Äôs just a game
[0:25:55] canadian_gamer_eh: @walcolive daddy chill, let swifty talk
[0:25:57] hardstyler9: the druid streamsnipe but not the pal :)
[0:26:05] blandbull: you dont watch asmond vids, lol, thats what he does
[0:26:08] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[0:26:14] Elwhappo: he targeted zeek and had a friend help, it was a stream snipe all day every day
[0:26:18] ParfumAmerican: 100% not snipe, is a stream satelite !
[0:26:19] SilkeySmooth: remember agreeing to a duel vs a streamer is a stream snipe
[0:26:34] blandbull: it was a snipe
[0:26:40] mynameisdone: Hes druid friend scouted to find where ziqo was and what layer, then the paladin turned on his stream for the SOLE purpose to get a clip of killing ziqo.
[0:27:08] CheesemaneTV: eye for an eye ret pally talent
[0:27:30] mynameisdone: That is 100% streamsniping.
[0:27:52] Pallyofhell: Pretty sure ziqo won this
[0:28:02] MCBRage: OMG adds
[0:28:07] SilkeySmooth: imagine calling it a stream snipe when you accept the duel to the death
[0:28:09] blandbull: he did
[0:28:10] Final_Griever: Not in classic
[0:28:13] blandbull: outplayed him
[0:28:15] Final_Griever: They get it in wrath I think
[0:28:29] ghostystv: cataclysm
[0:28:32] Deltogame: pallas only got auto attack
[0:28:36] Pallyofhell: It's not wrath
[0:29:06] Pallyofhell: Knows what?
[0:29:10] SilkeySmooth: dont duel streamers then they will say its a stream snipe
[0:29:38] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[0:30:03] LitheHS: Ziqo was at 8% and then the paladin had the goblin mortar backfire. Lucky
[0:30:03] blandbull: @SilkeySmooth im not a streamer and this was a snipe
[0:30:13] Sdeleon159: Holy cow. I didnt realize he got that low as well
[0:30:27] BartoPlaysGames: DONT FEED THE TROLLS @Swifty
[0:30:29] Maskedoutlaw: the sniper proof he sniped by streaming all of it. its to obvious.
[0:30:33] SilkeySmooth: so ziqo agreed to his stream snipe?
[0:30:33] hardstyler9: Ziqo says : come to duel me
[0:30:44] mynameisdone: @blandbull That paladin knew that ziqo would duel to death basicly everyone he saw at the same level so he got every single buff  and consume possible and specced for killing casters. Ziqo thought didnt know he had every single buff possible. Otherwise he would never dueled him.
[0:30:49] blandbull: that too
[0:31:00] funnyc4t: ziqo was not able to see all the buffs as well before accepting the duel.
[0:31:25] hardstyler9: for two days he had been saying: come and duel me
[0:31:32] blandbull: yeah, once he accepted it, he saw
[0:31:54] Pallyofhell: No
[0:31:57] neevir: probably not
[0:31:57] LykkLee: no
[0:31:58] BartoPlaysGames: You see! shush! @Swifty
[0:32:04] BartoPlaysGames: You'll
[0:32:11] Pallyofhell: They get a 3 day debuff that's it
[0:32:17] Chipi_qc: I don't think so
[0:32:21] hardstyler9: do cc out of the area and get the debuff is a bug
[0:32:33] mynameisdone: its not IRL 3 days debuff
[0:32:37] snuffles_80: and its 3 day ingame debuff.. you cant log out of it
[0:32:41] LykkLee: 3 day debuff INGAME no Irl
[0:32:42] mynameisdone: Its 3 days INGAME :D
[0:32:48] viirracocha: yo swiiiiift!
[0:33:00] funnyc4t: the debuff is so nasty as well LUL
[0:33:01] SilkeySmooth: so can a warlock fear you out of range and give you the debuff it they want
