[2:02:56] Qwake_TV: i feel like horde should run faster speed runs then alli but alli hold all records i think
[2:03:31] ekiprkl: that's a prebis trinket
[2:03:36] ekiprkl: so it's more expensive
[2:04:47] ekiprkl: yup, no need for dark runes ever. my pally has like 80+ of those
[2:05:01] xznips: here we go :)
[2:05:12] belemrys: paladin pulls op
[2:06:24] xznips: i think up until naxx its very even
[2:06:36] Qwake_TV: just feel like with the stacking warrior meta with a shaman twisting is just unsane
[2:06:38] Qwake_TV: insane*
[2:07:03] naryfail: "easier" to drop healers on ally kinda big reason ?
[2:07:13] xznips: more priests would be a game changer for horde imo but yee a tale as old as time
[2:07:31] naryfail: ofc it is, ur not forced to run 6 shamans
[2:07:35] mir3ib: windfury tho like packing 12 inches man

[2:07:59] DryphoTV: enchanting on the shaman ?
[2:08:00] Ranzorx: even all things equal I still feel like alliance would be 60% of the population for some reason
[2:08:05] Ranzorx: alliance players just really love alliance
[2:08:27] xznips: funfact for dali: we used 60+ in combat in the last FSP run
[2:09:08] Qwake_TV: bro 5x mara runs 1k gold
[2:09:09] Qwake_TV: fml
[2:10:13] belemrys: I mean, horde had hardcore raiders, they just quit...onslaught broke apart, and lelayne quit, who never did well past BWL
[2:10:20] belemrys: AQ40 killed horde
[2:10:49] xznips: gothik renew spam is massive, noth walkin also hots carry, prayer of healing is better then chainheal cause your positioning doesnt matter as much
[2:11:00] Ranzorx: dad gamers love playing paladin specifically ret
[2:11:18] Ranzorx: thats why sod is like 60%+ alliance
[2:11:26] Qwake_TV: wait is that ur internet or mine

[2:13:28] Trashcan_Player: this is making me want to play era. wbuff jump runs are so comfortable to watch/play
[2:13:38] xznips: also dispells, shields i like horde dont get me wrong but i 100% feel the massiv healing difference and we run 1 healer less on FSP then FunPol
[2:14:19] Bamboochew: blacksmith skellies, but ally would use moist towlette for that
[2:14:35] xznips: @Bamboochew they have a super high resist chance now
[2:14:54] belemrys: holy shit I forgot about Dreamstate
