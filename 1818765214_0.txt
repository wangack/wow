[3:17:58] timmythegamertv: Still need three keys tho right?
[3:18:05] Jeuffrey: you either combine 5 blue into purple, or get it directly from the guy. you need 3... yes its not 100% and it was since 1st day :)
[3:18:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Usually you have to collect 5 of one gem, open a little thing to get 5 of another gem to spawn the forge guy.....over and over and over
[3:18:11] Molvonos: Farm Yellow Crystals to Unlock weak locks for Purple Crystals.  Farm Purple Crystals to unlock big chest to get key and spawn forgemaster.
[3:18:11] TuRDz__: towlie Xaryu said ur the godfather of wow lol paid his hommage
[3:19:04] TuRDz__: his views skyrocketted

[3:19:58] Molvonos: They definitely buffed that
[3:19:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: That isn't done done, but I guess it's bugged to get the big ass dragon event

[3:22:45] WSquiggle12: What we thinking, official hard core servers?
[3:22:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I'd imagine WoWhead will do write-ups on it
[3:22:45] Sayryn: My guess is August
[3:22:48] rosina_scarlett: and will come with SoM2
[3:23:09] mavericks312: august would kill all the hype
[3:23:11] roofiedlocal: Not trying to sound like im complaining to you towelie but has anyone else not gotten their drop? It's been like two days ;(
[3:23:16] Synonymous: strike while the iron's lukewarm

[3:23:21] TweektheProphet: i would say late week june 1st week july
[3:23:27] lithium364: tomorrow PogChamp
[3:23:48] mavericks312: well yea casue wrath is stupid dead
[3:24:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Long-term hardcore servers would have at least some players
[3:24:21] rosina_scarlett: blizzard will let you group
[3:24:28] Synonymous: LULW
[3:24:51] LeXieSterling: What that is hard core
[3:24:58] LeXieSterling: Dead mean dead I guess
[3:25:04] Molvonos: And with the offical, if people grief enough and get reported, they risk getting banned.
[3:25:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard will allow bubble-hearth too (lol)
[3:25:16] jkitchin75: is cata classic still coming?
[3:25:37] rosina_scarlett: Yeah
[3:25:54] llNoTToXiCll: @LeXieSterling  hardcore is 1 life or restart / you cant you the ah or trade from other players all gear must come from what you loot or professions

[3:27:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: Making quest NPC's non attackable has always been a good idea, I think
[3:28:06] Molvonos: 'It creates jobs' my dude, they're not gonna hire people specifically for that, they're just going to make GMs do that 'job' too.
