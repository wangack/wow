[0:15:01] Indomitablez: @SONII When you use minimap button addon, you click the single button to open all the buttons, make sure you click it again to close them. If you mouse over the minimap it will expand them and it gets annoying but just click to close and its perfect

[0:22:22] rawlexdota: Might be advisable to buy the mats for ww axe from ah before the patch launch, they might explode in prices
[0:22:30] Hash_IX: i mean he was accusing you of stuff
[0:22:34] Hash_IX: weird person
[0:22:35] milliedk: he just wants attention kek
[0:22:40] limburgse: just an angry kid, dont worry about it <3
[0:22:43] BadGerbilLion: He lost the Papa Johns pizza giveaway :(
[0:22:50] tsetse2fly: @absorb_rl So feral druids have energy system like rogues, and there is a talent that makes you get instant 40 energy every time you go into cat form(also a helm +20 energy later) that's why you go in and out of cat form
[0:23:02] fellifell: he mad about treadmill girl lol

[0:26:13] isThisReaLife: It says "reminder from chinese consult" please contact us immediately.  I looked it up, its a scam that targets immigrants.
[0:26:30] swoozix: There's no shot dual wield is going to be stronger then twohander, eventhough I like DW build way more on warrs.
[0:27:01] realmalfurionsr: what if they adjust recipes between 225 and 240 to be 245?
[0:27:01] swoozix: rly? I saw some datamined items and it's another epic 2 hander Sadge
[0:27:09] tsetse2fly: @SONII you think they're gonna ban those items until level 50+?

[0:29:52] swoozix: Got any ideas on what runes are going to come in phase 2 for warriors, or anything you personally want to see?
[0:30:01] karrots96: Meh, its kinda the same deal as Humans getting a huge hit% advantage. Advantage disparities like these is what makes WoW classic

[0:43:04] MinervaMein: nauuuurrr pepeMeltdown
[0:43:11] D3KHAR: LUL
[0:43:18] D3KHAR: I saw a sweaty 10 hour session of just war games
[0:43:22] Seemetankin: huh
[0:43:23] give_me_a_1_in_chat: id rather get 5 capped in ab 100 times over than deal with unemployed druid players doing parkour in wsg

[0:43:50] alphaxbazx: Ouch
[0:44:02] rhidy: wsg is the worst bg
[0:44:11] PaulsGoneWild: ever join a random premade discord and the spergs just sweaty call outs
[0:44:20] pinochetsama01: Warsong si trash, arathi IS goated
[0:44:41] Waysideh: I swear PvP is what you make it though - I agree WSG is oppressive but competition is good regardless
[0:45:12] PaulsGoneWild: getting 5 capped in AB is the ultimate aids
[0:45:15] Seemetankin: AB is worse if anything
[0:45:23] lampsterof79: Did you do the original rank 14 grind?
[0:45:25] realmalfurionsr: they need to fix premades they is just bs
[0:45:27] djOrris: Whaddap fam! soniiWave soniiWave soniiWave
[0:45:28] Seemetankin: cause people scout where you go to the point that u dont cap anything
[0:45:34] draega1989: i got the Conqueror title back in the day...thats a lot of AB,WSG, and AV
[0:45:35] Indomitablez: I miss the 4-5 DAY AV's
[0:45:39] KojiMoons: KojiMoons subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Hope everything's going well. Been busy working on IRL shit
[0:45:40] D3KHAR: It's fun to be competitive and want to improve your play
[0:45:41] Runekdabest: Ppl saying AB is better than Wsg KEKW just wait till AB is out
[0:45:48] Waysideh: I feel like WSG has the most "sports" feel out of all them - most people just want to farm HKs and thats a recipe for losing
[0:46:08] Seemetankin: you guys haven't played AB premades if you think it'll be better
[0:46:14] djOrris: @SONII I rewatched your vod from last night with the wow xalatath vid and i died laughing again LOL
[0:46:14] realmalfurionsr: queuing pugs is crap you wait in a graveyard for 7 mins to get 33 rep
[0:46:17] D3KHAR: AB's going to feel like a breath of fresh air after so much WSG though I tell you
[0:46:43] Waysideh: WSG has more strategy and less about rock, paper & scissors fights
[0:46:57] jjgonzalez24: Cheer100 you're awesome
[0:47:02] gangletronic: yes way more 1v1s
[0:47:09] SgtDirtbag: i had the best bgs in ab
[0:47:24] wheeezyp: i cant wait to mc yeet people off the mountain :)
[0:47:53] Brudivoeller_TV: isn´t cheesyFC gameplay more fun in wsg?
[0:48:42] Harry3c: the braces arnt even i nthe game rn. hope blizz adds them
[0:48:59] kigami_uro: lmk if you want a geared warrior for wsg
[0:49:16] D3KHAR: I have the most fun in a WSG as FC
[0:49:21] djOrris: I can't wait for AB!
[0:49:28] PaulsGoneWild: mortal strike rune p2??
[0:49:29] TyrDraco: whats the bars for right?
[0:49:30] Brudivoeller_TV: @D3KHAR same
[0:49:35] kakenci: warriors players at 40 lvl will be sick
[0:49:37] Seemetankin: hunters and boomys enjoy WSG
[0:49:56] TyrDraco: far right*
[0:50:06] Harry3c: sick
[0:50:12] D3KHAR: But if you have a bad FC then it makes it difficult to win for the rest of the team
[0:50:20] Harry3c: i better start farming then
[0:50:21] D3KHAR: If I'm not FC and making a premade that's the most important spot imo
[0:50:29] gangletronic: shud get the rune swapper weakaura. just click the icon and it applies it
[0:50:34] Waysideh: WSG skill gap being based around jumps feels weird for sure, but I enjoy more strategy to the BGs aside from faceroll 1v1s - thats what Arena is for imo
[0:50:34] zephyr_inc: bro was lost lmao
[0:50:47] Skrimij_: I think I would kms if a priest did that to me
[0:50:48] hot6auce: anyone know what addon he has showing debuffs above enemy nameplate?
[0:51:15] draega1989: AB is a blast, you feel like a hero with your bois charging LM and taking em out
[0:51:18] draega1989: good times
[0:51:24] EggsotiX: @SONII Happy Friday my dude!
[0:51:28] Ilove_togetwet: a crazy healer/fc combo can take a wsg over for a team... 2 people cant really win an AB
[0:51:29] Harry3c: AB Soooo long if its 3 bases to 2 bases tho
[0:51:30] sudd7: especially druids that sit bear form and try to find the exit LUL
[0:51:38] Prawlx: GM is better
[0:51:42] Prawlx: zerging GM = bis
[0:51:46] hypnoidal: Is Stables/Lumber Mill/Blacksmith the best horde setup?
[0:52:07] Seemetankin: LOL
[0:52:11] Seemetankin: what kind of matchup is that

[0:52:26] hypnoidal: Payo was there as well I think
[0:52:43] give_me_a_1_in_chat: some of the most deranged and egotistical people ive played with are druid fcs. wsg ranking suck ass imo. but if u like to fc you do you
[0:52:45] TheTophie: I really want all your playlists. D:
[0:52:46] r0nin_xd: lmao i remeber the AB vampire clan got sooooo mad

[0:56:08] Ilove_togetwet: i thought we would have a tourny each bracket for SoD, not sure why we didnt
[0:56:15] shaygauge24: i dont think it will be that sweaty because there will be no help allowed in ssf

[0:57:54] chubbysugar12: yeah they seem to be hanging out there all day just training and bullshitting and coming up with ideas for the gym n shit
[0:58:16] zephyr_inc: i never played wow but HC and SOD got me hooked since it adds elements to the game that make it feel like a new experience for everyone playing
[0:58:25] angrynoob97: angrynoob97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Love ya brother
[0:58:28] Korben_dallas5: camp Knut 2.0?
[0:58:29] Ilove_togetwet: get the epic pump cover reveal and dip out for some BBQ
[0:59:11] EggsotiX: Me
[0:59:20] doylactus: me
[0:59:23] Farmers1: i think hardcore is just an unfun way to play the game
[0:59:25] EggsotiX: Rather chill with wow, not worry about dying lol
[0:59:29] PibbyTV: me i felt like it was a waste of time with a 9-5 job
[0:59:32] FaluranTV: yea i just cant do HC
[0:59:34] stumpe856: haven’t played a single minute of hardcore
[0:59:38] morgall1: My internet sucks too bad for hc
[0:59:38] Kingconn223: i wish they would do something like SoD but for TBC
[0:59:41] hypnoidal: that’s cause you were in Japan when HC blew up LUL
[0:59:42] D3KHAR: I didn't get into it because I play wow to pvp
[0:59:45] Kennosuke: I don't like the idea of hardcore tbh; too stressful and I'm too bad and casual
[0:59:47] ziiakk_: tbh hardcore is better in arpgs
[0:59:49] give_me_a_1_in_chat: the leveling process is just way too long for a hardcore mode. i wont play hc in wow but ill play it in like poe or diablo
[0:59:51] realmalfurionsr: hes on your roof
[1:00:17] realmalfurionsr: im in your game, on an alt
[1:00:20] trenboIoneacetate: lmao
[1:00:24] stewby1: wtf 4 pallys
[1:00:28] betterchetter: getting to 60 on hardcore is to hard for most people. unless you play priest.
[1:00:55] Kennosuke: like if the leveling process were faster, like Diablo, I'd be more into it.
[1:01:11] shaygauge24: right, theres literal resurrection spells in the game lol
[1:01:11] Kennosuke: but I don't want to spend weeks or months leveling to 58 and then die to something stupid
[1:01:16] Skrimij_: I think it’s cool if you can actually make it to 60, then it becomes perma, but no cheesy stats
[1:01:19] Skrimij_: strats
[1:01:21] Kennosuke: I love the idea it's just not for me
[1:01:21] sudd7: That's what made wow take off, most other MMO type games were very punishing upon death. and wow changed that. so i dont get it either
[1:01:22] angrynoob97: been watching any one piece?
[1:01:31] BadGerbilLion: In real life if you fall down the stairs you can die too, so what
[1:01:32] nixxor: did you see guzus death in sunken temple :O
[1:02:10] stewby1: I liked hardcore because it was a fresh server. Same thing with SoD. The first few months are so much fun.
[1:02:10] Seemetankin: that happened to the GM of my hardcore guild (ST falling through the ground) and everyone in the guild starting giga flaming eachother and his brain exploded. kicked everyone and cussed us all out
[1:02:12] sudd7: exactly lol
[1:02:15] hypnoidal: Didn’t the OG classic developers intend for there to be like a ghost world where you can come back to life again but you had to like complete some quests or challenges to come back to life instead of just running back to corpse? that would be interesting mix of hc and soft core
[1:02:20] Skrimij_: the only reason I didn’t play hardcore is because I would’ve never raided to die because of 1 person
[1:02:31] RitanRitual: the issue is, levelling in classic is already a slow grind and pulling more mobs etc sped up the levelling process if you didn't mind dying for overpulling. HC made that not worth it and just slower and more miserable levelling
[1:03:32] WhiteTowerGaming: what happened to it

[1:04:26] hugforheals: did he say why?'
[1:04:31] Genxq: What phase 2 prep are ya doing? :D
[1:04:35] Seemetankin: that's how it is man, raid leaders usually don't even want to do it. they just know nobody else wants to and they want to raid with the boys
[1:04:36] naexs: I think Hc for classic was great. PvE in classic is just to damn easy. Hc added some spice
[1:04:44] hugforheals: aight thats is understanding
[1:04:46] PibbyTV: very unfortunate for all parties
[1:05:15] D3KHAR: Takes a different breed of human to stomach that shit
[1:05:21] hypnoidal: my man resigned as QB1
[1:05:32] D3KHAR: Leading a raid of 40 people
[1:05:49] betterchetter: so stressful leading a raid.
[1:06:09] Genxq: What do you get from exalted
[1:06:21] JJnotokay: the raid part is easy managing 40 spergs is the hard part
[1:07:10] PunChE_Who: what’s the addon that shows other player specs?

[1:26:05] Ilove_togetwet: but do you have THEE FC
[1:26:23] EmVvVv: Someone probably already asked this but are you going to check out miz and Knuts gym?
[1:26:48] Kingconn223: save them to insta turn in
[1:26:50] Aurheimx: @birdi1337 exp, the gold amount will be nothing next phase
[1:26:57] Ilove_togetwet: we gonna dungeon spam regardless....
[1:27:17] birdi1337: @Aurheimx i mean xp it's going to be easy i feel like
[1:27:19] Skrimij_: @birdi1337 turn one in at a time and replace it with another
[1:27:21] Indomitablez: STV is going to be an absolute shit show. Dungeon spam is going to be the way
[1:27:39] birdi1337: @donnybrzrk did that already, i'm max
[1:27:40] Aurheimx: @birdi1337  i just want to do it to jump ahead of other players so i dont have to compete too much for quest mobs, i dont like to dungeon lvl
[1:28:17] santinirp: @veiloflonelystars Is Cataclysm easier to level than Lich King?  or the same thing?  Should I wait for the expansion to lving 1 new character?
[1:28:18] ryufromstreets6: what talents do you run for pvp priest
[1:28:19] birdi1337: @Aurheimx yeah. but i feel like it's going to be a lot more stuff to do
[1:28:20] realmalfurionsr: lol
[1:28:27] birdi1337: No need tu rush
[1:28:32] birdi1337: to*
[1:28:33] Skrimij_: @birdi1337 id say xp it, get to 40 faster it’s gonna be a lot funnier and you’re gonna get gold a lot easier at higher levels then turning it in now
[1:28:50] Skrimij_: @birdi1337 funner*
[1:28:55] Aurheimx: true, but if u do the turn ins thats like 20-40g depending on the quests, not much! @birdi1337
[1:29:02] birdi1337: Okey @donnybrzrk you got me, i'm going to wait
[1:29:20] veiloflonelystars: @santinirp generally i think it is cause they reduce xp required to lvl 80 then 80 to 85 takes a while
[1:29:25] birdi1337: I already got 30g and almoast bis war
[1:29:28] birdi1337: So i'm set
[1:29:40] veiloflonelystars: @santinirp you can also just lvl now then sit char at 80 for cata if u prefer
[1:30:16] ryufromstreets6: ngmi
[1:30:20] tylerfivek: ive got 27587 g

[1:31:20] birdi1337: I
[1:31:22] Skrimij_: @birdi1337 imo it’ll be a lot funner and efficient xping it, if you really need gold gdkp would be a lot faster
[1:31:24] birdi1337: Kidding
[1:31:26] realmalfurionsr: bruh

[1:34:05] ronartie: feelin great
[1:34:06] ronartie: love it

[1:35:14] Shepp22: it was my off day. did a little 6:30 mile just kinda cruisin
[1:35:42] D3KHAR: I swear to god I just saw it on the roof
[1:35:47] Pietruth: RIGHT HERE THIS
[1:35:56] lebrun_james_: good coms
[1:36:01] Skrimij_: @birdi1337 I think they scaled the gold artificially because 20 is max level so it might go down, but I think green/blues at 40 would vendor/ah for a lot more than 1g50s so it would be more efficient to just hit those higher level vendors faster
[1:36:13] D3KHAR: OMEGALUL
[1:36:18] shawnenfinger7: The flag is over yonder
[1:36:20] PunChE_Who: reminds me of FPS calls, “on my X bro”
[1:36:25] D3KHAR: He's scared stop it @SONII
[1:36:25] Skrimij_: @birdi1337 plus what are you going to do with that gold? buy gear you’re just gonna replace, might make leveling easier but just my opinion
[1:36:29] PunChE_Who: “HES ONE SHOT”
[1:36:47] birdi1337: @donnybrzrk roger, thanks mate. learning, i mean i like gold in stash
[1:36:53] birdi1337: :))

[2:45:26] Shepp22: toothpicks and stuff. beneficial just as addictive as caffeine and sugar tho
[2:45:28] realmalfurionsr: about the same minus the addictive properties
[2:45:32] youwiththefeds: Depends on how u intake it
[2:45:35] mynamesbeezy: its very comparible ive listened to huberman and peter
[2:45:37] mynamesbeezy: on that
[2:45:41] Leemster30: maybe for your heart?
