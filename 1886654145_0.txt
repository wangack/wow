[2:25:57] DINGODOGGERDUDE: yeah riding motorcycles teaches you how dumb most drivers are, always expect them to do something stupid
[2:26:01] MetroidRTX: you can be a very good driver, but other people can ruin your day anyway
[2:26:03] MetroidRTX: :P
[2:26:05] flyingfishrobe: Tank
[2:26:07] Sweash: that is very clever
[2:26:08] Tomfromuk: yh im from uk and i people here take everything you do on the road as a personal attack so its best to drive carefully and passively
[2:26:24] PermaGrinnn: i watched lights turn green and people start WALK across the road :S
[2:26:38] Skkold: For motorcycles there's a saying: always assume you are invisible to other people, they don't see you. This saves lives.

[2:27:06] nixter93: @Skkold yea.. riding motorcycles made me a much better driver. you have to predict the future
[2:27:14] LukeLuphin: I didn't get caught for speeding for 4 years, then I started feeling thankful that one has pulled me over & that I want to keep my record clean + you don't win that much time anyway. So I actually drive slow now
[2:27:22] MetroidRTX: well made macros will always win
