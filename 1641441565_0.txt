[0:22:14] Clozzy424: @fredemann You're losing too many stats if you have a spell pen OH + Wand at all times, and also if you're gemming for it since you only require that spell pen when going for a fear. So you switch oh and wand when going for a fear against paladins. otherwise, you use the gems/oh wand on his bis list.
[0:22:15] juicedude3k: what weapon are you using right now?

[0:24:54] juicedude3k: @Artistxtv okay thanks, just wasn't sure if the resil was needed
[0:25:14] bocard23: lmao
[0:25:32] Art1STxtv: @juicedude3k i got bout 934 resil atm
[0:25:41] Art1STxtv: it seems ok and im playing at around 2.2 mmr in 3s
[0:25:43] fredemann: thank you for more details üòÉ  think go for deadly spirit gear then.. not doing that much pve üòÖ then maybe get brutal for the spell prene

[0:27:09] Art1STxtv: have you got the legs from EoE yet @Hydramist
[0:27:23] Fulgore_22: would you say DK Disc is good for 2s?
[0:27:33] jmoz1234: Sorry if this is loaded question. But I set a goal to get good in wotlk and aim for the tabards at least for the coming seasons. Sometimes feels overwhelmed on what to focus on learning. Should I focus on getting rotations and dmg to second nature almost, then focus on strats on comps etc..?
[0:27:36] kokac333: dk sp would work so good
[0:28:04] kokac333: every class with dk is working
[0:28:08] Art1STxtv: man does JC really increase resil that much
[0:28:23] zippywow: Do you have anyway to stack more resi vs that dk to prevent u getting one shot
[0:28:24] Contrabandlol: @jmoz1234 what class? Disc priest?
[0:28:30] thrembu: allright thanks hydra!
[0:28:44] juicedude3k: @Artistxtv JC is + 54 resil right now
[0:28:49] thrembu: So i just buy Setpieces with my arena points?
[0:28:51] Art1STxtv: wait how do you have the exact same resil with both sets lol?
[0:29:06] zippywow: how come hydra seems so squishy
[0:29:08] dzwka: @Hydramist battlemaster helps me more then crystals vs dk
[0:29:17] zippywow: is 1k resi low for priest or?
[0:29:26] turkeydinners: thats overkill
[0:29:31] jmoz1234: @Contrabandlol SOrry, didnt specify. Im holy pala, but i was mostly thinking in general
[0:31:05] Contrabandlol: @jmoz1234 As a healer, I would say positioning is the most important skill to learn. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CokXbPFuLgM This is a good video on the topic
[0:31:18] cryingwolf30: 19 I think
[0:31:22] rivalxdttv: 20
[0:31:23] Silveryxd: 20 resil
[0:31:28] grandmarshalcrackmvp: 20
[0:31:33] jmoz1234: @Contrabandlol Thank you, i will watch that:)
[0:31:57] zippywow: this is silly
[0:31:59] dictatortvx: Dont buy the Deadly, buy the hateful. It is only like 2 resili difference or so. Much cheaper to get hateful.
[0:32:02] zippywow: how they can just run hydra down
[0:32:07] utbiu: fear through cloak

[0:33:20] dapsicle: How big is the stat difference between hateful and deadly?
[0:33:27] Biguns2033: i m priest and my friend hunter
[0:33:31] zippywow: 10% i think
[0:33:36] Biguns2033: i think we are soo bad
[0:33:42] Requiemthereal: didn't the hunter teach you?)

[1:17:39] 5h4d0w4rt: tbh i've noticed that the problem is more about you not being able to help the hunter in delivering the pressure because you're getting pressured yourself either on coerced into non-stop healing hunter or yourself
[1:17:56] Binoui: @Baldur_1337 nah deadly weapons are trash
[1:18:07] 5h4d0w4rt: yeah understandable :)

[2:25:43] Rayman_1990: for warriors for sure they are important
[2:25:55] fr0ggy89: is it a must?

[2:27:38] Rayman_1990: @froti89 Honestly Idk, dont remember what stats warrior pvp gear gives. It doesnt have armor pen does it ?
[2:28:28] ero__oce: depends on your goals, you can get 2k wearing full pvp gear as warr
[2:28:33] Rayman_1990: also pve trinkets are very good like always
[2:29:49] Deadelegy: are you raiding as your pvp spec or is this a pve disc spec you are using?
[2:30:54] fr0ggy89: Rayman_1990 right
[2:32:23] gldcad: Anyone know if spellpen on disc any good?
[2:34:47] dreadpkgg: While you're on that spell pen topic, do spell pen or hit effect whether or not your fear is resisted?
[2:35:17] pharp123: yes both
[2:36:11] LoL_F7: ret pally
[2:36:15] dreadpkgg: You happen to have a good macro for switching?
[2:36:26] LoL_F7: and sacred bullshit xD

[2:37:24] Rayman_1990: scumbag blood elfs rets have like 6% resist
[2:38:17] pharp123: paladins DansGame
[2:39:46] suxatheals: Have you noticed spells miss instead of resist into cloak?
[2:41:01] suxatheals: the tooltip says resist on cloak
[2:41:05] awesomeraff: tried mouseover instead of clicking frames?
[2:41:36] suxatheals: not a huge deal just more blizz things
[2:43:58] awesomeraff: fair
[2:44:30] sneakypeters: RBGs in wrath +? What changes to make them better
[2:44:32] Deadelegy: there's an addon that's called clique that allows you to bind abilities separate from the action bar and they all function as mouseover. it's good for raiding but i'm not a fan for pvp. you might be interested in it
[2:45:11] fr0ggy89: 5v5 in ab/wsg instead
[2:45:14] fr0ggy89: :D
[2:45:15] sneakypeters: wsg could probably actually be a game mode if blizz put like 10% effort into it
[2:45:38] fr0ggy89: but seems boring tbh
[2:45:50] fr0ggy89: arena is all you can ask for
