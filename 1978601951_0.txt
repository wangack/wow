[1:18:49] Natlum: Voljin OMEGALOL
[1:18:50] Atma23: Trolls always get disrespected in the Lore
[1:18:50] LosDuervo: Voljin got done bad.

[1:18:52] GrumlingGaming: Characters killed off by writers who never really understood them.

[1:46:00] eggcheezpotato: danDoor
[1:46:03] Wrenton: I hope SoS becomes something more and doesn't just "go away" leaving characters to be slingshotted to Retail or Classic Wrath NotLikeThis.
[1:46:07] ravingsanity: Druids have seal form for swimming too which is nice

[1:46:25] Wrenton: I hope SoD* becomes something more and doesn't just "go away" leaving characters to be slingshotted to Retail or Classic Wrath NotLikeThis.
[1:46:28] Xierany: @Zaince Depends if you get shit yourself or if you have viewers to give you gear, consums and gold
[1:46:29] zeitthemonke: if a seal mated w/ a druid while in seal form what baby

[1:47:55] Hav3nsblade: Bear pets = best pet
[1:48:05] ravingsanity: but in classic, you had to tame all kinds of pets to get abilites you could teach to your other pets
[1:48:35] SekretAznMan: danComfy
[1:48:35] ravingsanity: then there's also taming rares for funzies
[1:48:57] ravingsanity: mostly for the unique look
[1:49:22] CanadianUncleSam: I liked the White Lion from the Barrens I believe.
[1:49:26] CanadianUncleSam: Just for the look.
[1:49:31] Sunhammer756: isnt there a rare cat in stv that is really good
[1:49:36] Trazix52: Broken tooth fastest attack speed
[1:49:37] ravingsanity: mostly, yeah, but there was definitely the taming pets to collect their abilities

[1:51:05] OkayDroo: do they scale in hardcore?
[1:51:07] Demonmk2: The weirdest pet lupos that does shadow damage rather then physical
[1:51:20] Rellak: maybe you should gear your pet then. maybe owlbert would like a nice +7 coat
[1:51:34] Taid87: i think pets can trigger a buff on you, so fast attackspeed might be usefull for questing
[1:51:42] Manyfist: SoD is gonna scale the pets
[1:51:42] Taid87: eventually you spec into marks afaik
[1:51:48] ravingsanity: I think 'lock demons do inherit some stamina
[1:51:49] Wrenton: @okaydroo no
[1:51:55] Lithium24: I think the dinosaur pets have scaling tho
[1:52:03] Daret9056: the pets are more about utility
[1:52:11] GrumlingGaming: I miss the unique pets having unique stats. FeelsBadMan
[1:52:22] Atikk: Once finals are over ima play wow HypeAwww HypeAwww
[1:52:29] CanadianUncleSam: I liked when they made it so different pet families had different "roles" or things they were good at. Made each one feel more unique or special.

[1:53:23] the_undying1: i liked Cataclysm tbh

[1:54:18] TheyCallMeMrJJ: oh hey, hello secret strim peeps danCult
[1:54:24] ravingsanity: I respect those who liked Cata, but for me it fundamentally changed the base world so that it was more of a theme park rather than a world you could live in. It's still fun, but that was a huge shift.
[1:54:27] CanadianUncleSam: Why is the stream a secret?
[1:54:29] Ultracept: OK, thanks
[1:54:31] Natlum: @TheyCallMeMrJJ danHat

[1:55:50] Cakedonut: mind gobbler? danKappa
[1:55:52] hipsi85: finishing HC wow PogChamp
[1:56:22] Empac: here's something that has puzzled me. Why can't Warlocks tame other demons and train them like pets the same why hunters can do animals?
[1:56:23] worldbefree: I need to see the 2nd movie on mushrooms first
[1:56:26] authorized411: ubisoft already advertising battle pass for avatar
[1:56:31] Maniac187: are you gonna to play the new warhammer RTS?
[1:56:33] InsaneRuskiy: first ever wow dungeon run in deadmines and i got the cruel barb sword for my rogue.. WOO
[1:56:36] febig: everytime hunter shoots, me: Wokege
[1:56:37] ravingsanity: another thing to note for HC is, if you get really attached to your character and it dies, you can get a free move to a regular classic realm.
[1:56:39] CanadianUncleSam: @authorized411 Of course they did, would you expect anything less?
[1:56:51] Zaraji: cirD
[1:56:58] Slippage_: except with the succubus Dan LUL
[1:57:01] DrWraithjr: Warlocks are more BDSM

[1:57:05] CanadianUncleSam: Says you. My Succubus loves me.
[1:57:10] Toon11: well some demons want to help danBlush
[1:57:11] Smite_A_Moose: you dont know me and my demons
[1:57:13] trip_ma: danBlush maybe it's the demon's kink
[1:57:13] epiphany79: Warlocks sound like corporate America @DansGaming
[1:57:14] KunoVanOyten: danScoop hardcore strim in the wetlands
[1:57:22] DacePerado: @Empac I think it's because they come from another realm, summoned into this realm. So you can't tame one that's already been summoned by someone else danSmart
[1:57:23] Thorggrim83: How dare he assume to know what a demon wants danCult danCult
[1:57:23] pctr2142: Incubus is just like oh its you..
[1:57:25] Atikk: Hunter sux to lvl bc youre not a tank or a healer

[1:58:53] ElusiveOne_: @Cakedonut at least the snow isnt coming out of ur butt again danKEK2
[1:58:57] zac_who: @DansGaming I have a WoW lore question for you: In the WoW novel "The Shattering", it said that Falstad Wildhammer was going to be on the Council of Three Hammers, but in the beta it was Kurdran Wildhammer, and Falstad was not in the game at all. What happened to him?
[1:59:01] Wrenton: @atikk yeah,  your a DPS coxWat
[1:59:04] CanadianUncleSam: How's that Polearm working out, Dan?
[1:59:09] Thorggrim83: @ravingsanity  A classic prot warrior that didnt spec prot until Molten Core? LUL

[1:59:26] ElusiveOne_: @KrisMenace yesterday was AMOGUS danSnow2
[1:59:32] Empac: ok then let me ask it this way. Why cant warlocks enter into contracts with other demons in the game other then the ones given? like burning legion has sooooo many demons I would love to get into contract with
[1:59:32] Atikk: Tank HypeAwww HypeAwww

[1:59:52] ravingsanity: @thorggrim83 haha, not while leveling, no, but I did tank a ton of dungeons
[1:59:56] ElusiveOne_: im just demonstrating @SekretAznMan danRude

[1:59:58] KnoNock: Looked like Season of Discovery brings more melee options for hunters

[2:01:16] Manyfist: TBC fixed a lot and Wrath perfected it
[2:01:18] KodaiRyu: only dwarf hunter get gun ?
[2:01:24] MorgrimReaper: i think Paladins arte a good example. they didn't get a taunt.

[2:01:42] Zaraji: everything was pretty much viable in wrath
[2:01:44] StaleSavage: big elf danP
[2:02:03] ravingsanity: We did lose a little choice, though. With the old talent system, you could main one group and pick up a few points in another spec. Once they "fixed" it, variety kind of went out the window
[2:02:06] StaleSavage: danBlush
[2:02:06] KrisMenace: @drakduck7 The tids got in the way and they tripped danSad

[2:02:32] drakduck7: @krismenace or running too fast and they knocked her out danKEK2
[2:02:34] ElusiveOne_: danBush
[2:02:35] ravingsanity: but, at the end of the day, for end game stuff you had to spec a particular way anyway, so I guess it's moot
[2:03:29] Lithium24: @ravingsanity Yeah, most people just end up in a few cookie cutter specs anyhow
[2:03:44] SekretAznMan: NODDERS
[2:03:47] michaelm3333: danB
[2:03:47] Lithium24: tbh most of the time I can't be assed to make up my own specs in classic
[2:03:54] michaelm3333: danTifa danTifa
[2:03:56] Gogo04: hunters often have to kill their pets in raids as well
[2:03:58] Trazix52: Arms warrior best spec
[2:03:59] banadano: No being able to throw traps sucks too
[2:04:02] Vertex3: stupid math nerds
[2:04:06] ravingsanity: @Lithium24 if you want to do end game content with other people, then, yeah, you are "required" to be spec'ed a certain way.
[2:04:12] Crowskape: Well, you can spec like a donkey, but people will kick you
[2:04:13] Atikk: Wow is good but could use more graphic imo
[2:04:33] Atikk: Lineage was 20 years ago
[2:04:43] Maniac187: WC4 danSad
[2:04:44] Lithium24: @ravingsanity totally, your raid leaders are going to give you shit in classic if you have a crappy spec hampering your output
[2:04:48] ravingsanity: you have freedom while leveling, so there's that at least, but at end game, yeah, everyone ends up the same
[2:04:56] Toon11: I think warcraft introduced this cartoonish style
[2:04:57] Mastrshok: It needs to be able to run on potatoes so most people can play for that money
[2:05:00] Mescheen: danOld
[2:05:00] SekretAznMan: LULW true
[2:05:01] highiq93: and everyone did!

[2:10:13] Lithium24: I have a group of friends who still insist on using Ventrilo in 2023 because "blah blah audio quality"
[2:10:17] ravingsanity: Watching you and other streamers play this got me started on my own HC character, and I have to say it feels a lot like the game did at release.

[2:10:51] DrWraithjr: monkaS evil goggles
[2:11:23] ravingsanity: I've found there is a sense of community that hasn't existed in a while
[2:11:24] Lynn_Emilie: its essentially like a Roguelike now
[2:11:24] BoodyTV: classic as well as the retail features next year got me back after 3 years free lol
[2:11:31] sinful474: rogue 60
[2:11:38] DacePerado: The creator of the Hardcore WoW addon must be proud
[2:11:52] Mord_Vi: night elf rogue, made it to 60, and got bored of the end game at the time (pre dlc)

[2:12:45] DacePerado: @KrisMenace Especially after that famous quote of "You think you want it, but you don't" now it's popping off
[2:12:51] Empac: a boomstick
[2:12:56] CanadianUncleSam: A Rifle? No way!
[2:12:57] Gogo04: progression servers brought back a lot of everquest players as well. very few people play the new content now days. maybe 150 to 200 people
[2:13:04] KrisMenace: @DacePerado How wrong he was danKEK2
[2:13:20] ravingsanity: I do really wish, though, that they weren't bringing Cata to Classic. I would love it if they would give us an option to permanently freeze at WotLK.
[2:13:22] LooneyHouse: @Gogo04 Was thinking the exact same thing. People enjoy those progression servers too
[2:13:45] ravingsanity: or I guess I could just play raw classic
[2:13:49] Atikk: Wow 2004 memories
[2:13:52] Snabido: MoP classic just 1 expansion away Keepo
[2:13:53] Atma23: Didn't they say Cataclysm with changes
[2:13:59] Supported: !followage
[2:14:01] Crowskape: Classic wow is a great reminder that the journey matters
[2:14:06] zeitthemonke: imagine something with cat in the name being troublesome!
[2:14:13] Toon11: my guess is 1 less than before Bob!
[2:14:22] ravingsanity: the draw for classic for me is being able to inhabit the world, and cata changed it
[2:14:22] DrWraithjr: The underwater zone was good
[2:14:25] Eraste: i didnt like cata but a ton of people will paly it because it was so difficult
[2:14:27] DiggerDempsey: oh
[2:14:28] Atma23: @DansGaming they said they were going to change up what cataclysm was like

[2:14:38] Rellak: the thing i really remember people hating about cata was the personal responsibility requirement due to the restraints in healer mana

[2:15:10] Snabido: I imagine the pacing will be adjusted
[2:15:11] Mortuno: bobrossMeta burkePay
[2:15:15] Atma23: @DansGaming The event pre-cata where Deathwing would just blaze an entire zone and kill everyone was fun.

[2:15:41] Purplehamster: @Cerala @Snabido @Mortuno @ChieveMoe danHi
[2:15:46] Bi0_: Probably a melee hunter.  Kappa
[2:15:47] Lithium24: The death heat map for Dustwallow is pretty funny, all the low levels making the run to other starting zones
[2:15:56] brianite: They add wow token because there is a market for it. People are buying gold in hc classic
[2:16:02] KodaiRyu: is it just me or is death map broken @DansGaming ?
[2:16:09] ChieveMoe: @Purplehamster danBobble danHi

[2:16:24] ravingsanity: I like just feeling like I'm inhabiting the world in WoW. Like, I'll do quests for a bit, then maybe I'll go fishing, or just go sight seeing. It's just less on rails.

[2:17:38] ravingsanity: (raptor horns, anyone?)
[2:17:54] ravingsanity: maybe claws
[2:17:55] Eraste: i almost walked by a pvp flagged mob in ashenvale while there was a horde ?? next to me danS i could tell he wanted to one shot me if i accidentally flagged
[2:18:04] ravingsanity: it took foreeeeeeeever to get those drops
[2:18:11] Rellak: @drakduck7 ohh yeah, that was a buttclencher. good thing it leashed relatively quickly
[2:18:11] a__penguin__: i nearly ran into stitches while alt tabbed... yikes
[2:18:24] DrWraithjr: rhino horn is on the nose
[2:18:26] Entropystachio: If humans can have horn raptors can too
[2:18:27] drakduck7: @rellak agreed, he got lucky
[2:18:47] SekretAznMan: danKEK2
[2:18:49] ravingsanity: I think because this game was originally created by some EQ vets, they built in the need to "grind".
[2:18:51] tinyangrygnome: me too danDespair
[2:18:53] bob_3002: He can quit whenever he wants danUgh

[2:20:22] CyorZ3: diablo 4 players - quest? what quest?
[2:20:23] ravingsanity: and a lot of beasts drop stuff/junk that sells for a pretty decent chunk of change
[2:20:25] Empac: one as a goal at the end, the other is just grinding
[2:20:30] WASHED_UP_TWITCHVIEWER: danNice
[2:20:36] nolraizer24: danLurk
[2:20:41] drakduck7: Yeah. If you're gonna grind may as well grind and bang out a quest at the same time
[2:20:44] DacePerado: Damn that name is long
[2:20:51] Atikk: Wc3 was a great game wow was a good adaptation idk if they included its original community in its massive sucess
[2:21:22] drakduck7: Gargalondeeznuts died, nooooo
[2:21:38] Atikk: But fck wc3  ight
[2:21:45] ravingsanity: before WoW originally released, I know a lot of my friends who were into the mainline Warcraft games were really looking forward to it.
[2:21:50] kingsliee: danBrain
[2:22:06] ravingsanity: they all got really into WoW when it released
[2:22:07] Purplehamster: @Atikk It's a shame the resmasterd wc3 was bad, I've never played a wc game before and wanted to try it
[2:22:09] slotshot13: danF Gargleondeez
[2:22:14] DacePerado: danBased
[2:22:49] Gogo04: the first mmo was in 1995 i believe
[2:22:52] ravingsanity: at the time this came out, the only other really big MMO that had existed before this was EQ
[2:23:01] neuroxin: warcraft 3 spawned both WoW and indirectly League of Legends
[2:23:01] killinseason187: I reset my follow time by mistake NotLikeThis
[2:23:09] kooshy_j: EQ was too sweaty, WoW made MMOs approachable
[2:23:14] Purplehamster: @killinseason187 Oh no! danD
[2:23:20] Atikk: Not worth looking forward to wc4 and sc3
[2:23:23] SekretAznMan: it was definitely my first NODDERS

[2:23:23] ravingsanity: this was my first MMO

[2:23:55] ravingsanity: also had Metzen and others who worked on original EQ
[2:23:56] kooshy_j: I played Ragnarok Online first and had no idea what I was doing even though I loved it LUL

[2:24:00] Gogo04: diablo 1 as well 1995
[2:24:01] Toon11: the genius behind wow is its userfriendlyness
[2:24:02] Lithium24: @Gogo04 Come on, now you're just pulling my leg
[2:24:12] LukeitsScoot: other games expected you to know how to walk in an mmo, wow taught you how to walk and then built off that
[2:24:13] TheNotoriousLion: swg was great danNodders
[2:24:13] neuroxin: i was playing final fantasy 11 when WoW came out and WoW was such a relief because FFXI was so hard
