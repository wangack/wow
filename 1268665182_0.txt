[0:17:43] TraeF: @IamBananasBruh confirmed?
[0:17:59] TraeF: woaw
[0:19:32] TraeF: 63 billion us dollars? kinda expensive for how they treated their games and community ^^
[0:19:35] gotmygoodelf: gotta be good for blizz employees
[0:19:41] Dr_Kronen: @IamBananasBruh I agree with preach on this... there are worse companies that could have bought them out (cough EA cough). If it makes any changes though time will tell - specifically when deal is complete in 2023.
[0:19:49] Sephirothxz: If 9.2 is good and 10.0 announcement strictly after 9.2 launch it will create a huge hype around wow
[0:20:51] Sephirothxz: @traef what does that mean? So a company price is based on that? Its based on the value of the company. Wow alone is one of the most profitable game out there.
[0:21:12] ZakuzaGB: greeting
[0:21:16] ZakuzaGB: s
[0:21:21] ZakuzaGB: :)
[0:22:16] Dr_Kronen: @IamBananasBruh I think the worry now is how much they do hands off or on... i.e. will they start to remove certain problematic individuals AND will they actually keep pushing WoW as an entity... some rumours saying it could come to game pass which would be interesting LUL
[0:23:10] TraeF: @rektariz its more a personal opinion because  the most money goes exactly to that douche´s that driven the comp into that shithole :/
[0:23:55] ZakuzaGB: i just want my video games to be good make it happen microblizz haha
[0:24:31] Sephirothxz: @traef and i repeat marketing wise what does that mean? Do you think microsoft gives a shit about it? They bought a company that will make them probably way more money and that is all that matter for them
[0:24:33] TraeF: wow included in gamepass pls Kappa

[0:25:28] Dr_Kronen: @TraeF to be fair, if that happened, you'd get a LOT of new players quickly... but I think there would be loads more items in the store on top of what's already there... gotta make that dollar dollar yo
[0:26:30] Sephirothxz: @dr_kronen honestly who cares the game can survive some items in the store as long as its not player power
[0:26:42] Dr_Kronen: @rektariz 100%
[0:26:50] Sephirothxz: @dr_kronen character power*
[0:26:51] mmrghost7: the worst part of this deal is to remove wowtoken
[0:27:42] varrdragon: wow token I not going anywhere. they make too much off it
[0:27:44] ZakuzaGB: wait where did you read they are removing wow token?
[0:28:09] Sephirothxz: If they put a mog on the blizzard store and someone buy it i have no problem with. To me that transmog have 0 value and that is what matter in wow.
[0:28:49] Sephirothxz: As long as they keep developing good gameplay nice content etc
[0:29:10] ahies28: people are guessing we no idea whats going to happen mind you it will be 18 months til the deal has gone through
[0:29:32] ZakuzaGB: yeah lol
[0:29:42] ZakuzaGB: people saying 11.0 will be the new era
[0:30:00] ZakuzaGB: but im still holding out what little hope i have left for 10.0
[0:30:02] ZakuzaGB: haha
[0:30:11] Sephirothxz: 11.0 will be in what? 4 years? Honestly who cares ahah
[0:30:28] varrdragon: right ppl are acting like Microsoft starts now. will be at least a year by anything goes down
[0:30:33] ZakuzaGB: yeah because 11.0 will be under the new microblizz and changes might have been made by that point
[0:30:53] ahies28: wow makes more than billion a year l cant see too much changing maybe the wow tram gets bigger but not much else will change

[0:33:33] ahies28: or wowtoken going away
[0:33:36] Sephirothxz: @ahies28 tell me one game nowdays that doesnt have it?
[0:33:51] ahies28: thats my point
[0:34:00] Sephirothxz: @ahies28 obviously online game
[0:34:00] valianya: Blizzsoft sounds better than Microblizz...  But jokes aside, Microsoft has a very different business model for the games studios they own than Activision has.  I think they're going to push to make the emphasis on good gaming experience over just pushing metrics for the shareholders to hide player numbers loss.  Look at the other games Microsoft owned studios have been putting out.

[0:38:46] Sephirothxz: @traef the problem is that they are trying to get their spot in the mmo genere but wow and ff14 are such huge games that is hard for the to take that little spot. People invested too much in those games to think about permanently switching
[0:39:24] varrdragon: towBeer
[0:39:25] valianya: But I also think we'll be seeing better marketing too, likely eventually Twitch drops for WoW and other external marketing campaigns for expansion releases or even major/final raid patches.  We might even see lore spoilers hidden on ptr and some internal quality control outside of ptr testing
[0:39:43] ahies28: @zakuzagb l have 5 more legion class mount to go and they are the full quest line which will be fun
[0:39:44] TraeF: @ZakuzaGB xD i like the player driven content so much with the area´s, changing metas and diplomacy that i cant stop till today but i see many people leave and never come back :/

[0:48:36] pixxelina: could be cool but not so WoWish
[0:49:01] dustypawsie: Oh...so Microsoft really took over Activision Blizz....that's kinda good news. Tencent would've just milked the company dry and then disposed of it anyways. I think Microsoft could bring a bright future to WoW. :)
[0:49:08] ZakuzaGB: i dont mean similar style of music though, a WoW style unique track for the boss
[0:49:11] kandor01: finally, hammerman is online
[0:49:26] ZakuzaGB: more a boss theme than fight music

[0:52:24] valianya: Pretty sure there is background music in boss fights and raids already, its just not loud and gets drowned out by effect sounds, and a lot of sounds are important as signifiers of abilities in wow raid fights

[1:02:04] Shaele: without microsoft acquiring them, Blizzard would have slowly wilted off in the next 2-3 years of constant issues. The brains have long since left the company
[1:02:09] mmo_kenna_: Microsoft made sure that loot box items could be earned in game for ESO when they took over

[1:13:48] Mazkon: GamePass ultimate bout to pop the fuck off next year
[1:13:49] Frantixx: Biggest deal for Microsoft EVER
[1:13:49] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf no but they might make is so only time spend in game uses the token time since that wouldbe better chance
[1:13:52] Brad_The_Newfie: Unless someone buys EA
[1:13:55] EASanDiego: i'm sure we will
[1:13:58] valianya: Nah, Warcraft developed into a tv series, the next Game of Thrones contender
[1:14:07] Xsilentghost: The new elder scrolls game though will be a big deal, Going back to single player potentially co-op skyrim type of game with be a huge miss for sony etc.
[1:14:08] BenEaton: Sony will definitely make a move and acquire something soon to compete I would imagine
[1:14:13] Alegnowar: EA has 37Bn market cap, ATVI is worth way more than EA
[1:14:13] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: xqcJuice
[1:14:14] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf insted of passivly time ticking diwn playing or not imagine if the token was only going down when people was playing
[1:14:15] LoseAlotLuke: any juicers
[1:14:15] Chiraakitteh: Next highest was a DELL-ENT(or some arrangement of letters, lol) for like 17
[1:14:33] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf that way the token might cost 1 million gold but it would be so much better
[1:14:49] luckfore: now its worth 2.3 trillion :D
[1:14:55] lucasgriffinduke: im trying to figure out what class to play as a dps any ideas anyone?
[1:14:56] Mazkon: last year was also before the bobby fiasco
[1:14:57] SaitamaTheDalaiLama: going to be subbing to Xbox game pass that's for sure
[1:15:00] Markaveli007: fifa
[1:15:00] Alegnowar: i don't get it either
[1:15:09] Dinermoe: what does EA have? LUL
[1:15:15] Frantixx: And if u can grasp that this really is the biggest deal for Microsoft all categorys, that is kinda ballers tbh. Gaming on top guys zbtvPOG
[1:15:17] Dinermoe: oh damn yeees
[1:15:22] LoseAlotLuke: that guy who bought Activision out of bankruptcy for 500k back in 1993 sheesh
[1:15:28] tedol: @Dinermoe fifa
[1:15:32] quinraylo: wonder if blizzard headquarter will move to WA
[1:15:47] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf instead of removing the token or going to 50 k gold make it so only goes down when in game the time ticks when in game players are doing something :)
[1:15:49] MrGattz: i hope EA gets bought out by literally anyone. apply buying EA would even be a relief at this point
[1:15:51] sinjordan: too big of a monopoly, MS is gonna get hit with investigations over this deal @Towelliee
[1:15:52] BrutalHermit: I dont think Disney had to do that. And they own freakin everything now lol
[1:15:57] LoseAlotLuke: is there any form of financial fair play in this industry lol
[1:16:22] Funderik: no way blizzard move, all those amazing statues outside, it wouldn't be the same.
[1:16:25] Alegnowar: maybe microsoft will revitalize MLG
[1:16:32] pakamov: Do you think this will change the way Blizzcon is held ? Maybe Microsoft would like announcements under their events @Towelliee
[1:16:33] bakurathewolf: @RunningOutOfRAM ya that sound right  hopefully Microsoft being in charge well make ppl come back and bring in some new player
[1:16:35] Dinermoe: i hope everyone gets treated and payed equally, we get great games and everyone enjoys blizzard again in the future
[1:16:36] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf that is my take on the WOW token ofc it will be like a million for 1 token but it would last literally 5-6 mothns of play time for the avrage joe
[1:16:57] Persephonae: people saying that dont really understand what a monopoly is lol
[1:17:01] tedol: Nintendo and Sony still there
[1:17:08] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf that way isnted of focusing on subscribers they will focus on game player
[1:17:16] Alegnowar: they keep forgetting how much Tencent has
[1:17:20] kandor01: There is no competition for gaming imo. Making games is art, you cant copy it.
[1:17:24] Blackhaxx: i was here, when the mount dropped
[1:17:33] alextheory_: the money they have doesnt come from gaming anyways so people complaining their too big is nonsense
[1:17:39] valianya: News article said this deal might face issues with anti monopoly depends if its considered a Technology acquisition or an Entertainment acquisition
[1:17:41] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf for example today players 20 million hours of WOW insted of having lets say 200 k subs
[1:17:48] sinjordan: Tencent owns shares, they arent the parent company for all of those though @Alegnowar
[1:17:55] Mazkon: First changes will come in 2023, if any
[1:18:10] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf that way focusing on playing the game insted of subbing to the game would be much better for me
[1:18:11] tedol: @Mazkon second half of 2023
[1:18:13] Kriven: this stuff takes years to process
[1:18:39] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf but wow should never go Free To Play
[1:18:40] Moobot: Who wins? https://strawpoll.com/cz3q7xfco
[1:18:41] sinjordan: WoW on console
[1:18:43] Chiraakitteh: I’d guess that the deal buys out all of tencent, they’re paying cash instead of trading stock
[1:18:44] Mazkon: @Mazkon doesnt change what i said
[1:18:48] Kriven: @Fendrick123 well activision already does that so lets see if its for teh better
[1:18:54] sinjordan: !?!? is FF can be on console why cant WoW
[1:18:58] Shapelessdnb: Lost Ark campaign? Like in-game or do you mean promo?
[1:19:22] Chiraakitteh: I mean all of Tencent's shares
[1:19:25] lalelusa: so exited for LA - I even took some time off work :) it's been a while since I did that
[1:19:28] bakurathewolf: @RunningOutOfRAM that's why I'm happy Microsoft balt out blizard
[1:19:30] SaitamaTheDalaiLama: if the government blocks Microsoft acquisition then you best believe they better be blocking Take Two acquisition of Zynga too
[1:19:38] bob12550: @shapelessdnb it's Amazon game so probably promo like new world
[1:19:41] itsapaul: D:
[1:19:50] kandor01: nightfae arms warrior is nuts
[1:19:55] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee the only face I miss from blizzard is Chris Metzen, that dude had energy and ...everything
[1:20:09] RunningOutOfRAM: @bakurathewolf will see what happens can't tell the future but I hope it is for the better
[1:20:09] tedol: @SaitamaTheDalaiLama what I saw, they shouldn't
[1:20:10] Shapelessdnb: Alright alright. Could be sick
[1:20:12] warrenny: Wish necro pala was better
[1:20:15] bob12550: hopefully lost ark is better than new world

[1:21:09] RunningOutOfRAM: @Towelliee what do you think about WOW token not Expiring 30 days after purchase but expiries onl when people (stay) play in game ?
[1:21:10] tedol: 3 more weeks, right? Is it the 14 or 16 of February?

[1:23:32] valianya: Government didn't block Disney picking up Marvel, or FOX, or Star Wars, so if Activision Blizzard is considered Entertainment acquisition then shouldn't be blocked by government either
[1:23:46] Alegnowar: ye man he's irrelevant already
[1:23:51] Funderik: an ex-dev obviously with more leaks about a leak that got leaked being leaked

[1:32:31] pacificmc1: celestial map?? there was that celestial armor promotion recently too
[1:32:34] Funderik: there's no varients to them, just recolour, is blizzard really that lazy to just recolour each aspect for a new expansion? maybe..i don't want to believe so tho

[1:39:19] valianya: There's a npc ghost in BC in Bloodmyst Isles that was the last of the Dragonriders of Loreth'Aran, a kaldorei settlement, and rode green dragons given them by Ysera.  he tells the story ingame.  Prince Toreth is his name

[1:45:11] funKShun: TRUE and REAL
[1:45:14] eakiller: well monopoly behavior
[1:45:18] NickLeonhearth: They will take their time with 10.0 now, not only because it's 10.0 but because microsoft is not associated with it, and it will be a HUGE event
[1:45:20] rbayduden: well, vista was shit
[1:45:30] KaisenSiru: Good
[1:45:36] lalelusa: MS might not be able to improve WoW as a game, but they sure can improve the infrastructure surrounding the game
[1:45:36] Zettabyte: Vista? pepeMeltdown
[1:45:38] Shapelessdnb: Didn't Phil do an interview on banning / toxicity across platforms? Could this be them cleaning Acti-Blizz of bobby?
[1:45:39] Chiraakitteh: MS has a real Human Resources department!

[1:45:48] Alienfromger: with all the issues i quess it was a deal for microsoft
[1:45:55] Keyastaron_: i hope CoD wont be an xbox exclusive
[1:45:56] k3ntizZ: Hey Didi you know Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard for 68.7 billion dollars?
[1:46:04] Darwoo: nah we didnt know
[1:46:05] valianya: Azshara is a free agent now, Xalatath is too.  There's also planets out there with totally unknown Old Gods that could come to Azeroth, because the Void Lords scattered Old Gods across the cosmos.
[1:46:19] Dinermoe: in the power of X
[1:46:20] MaaQ: similar thing happen with mojang , microsoft did not force mojang to do any major changes till couple of years later
[1:46:21] pakamov: Activision would sack 15 devs instead LUL
[1:46:22] Zettabyte: Mixer Kappa
[1:46:23] ralecgos: @k3ntizZ are you trolling? read the title
[1:46:25] funKShun: @keyastaron_ they can't make COD exclusive, they will miss a lot of money if they do that
[1:46:33] madein90ss: yeah activision was just making the most with least effort .. cutting any extra costs ...cringe
[1:46:38] Torse9: Microsoft has a long term plan, it can afford to have far reaching goals
[1:46:39] warrenny: @keyastaron_ Dude.... no chance same as es 6
[1:46:43] k3ntizZ: @ralecgos Kappa
[1:47:07] ralecgos: @k3ntizZ thank god
[1:47:08] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee We just need people who talk to the community to be more transparent and open minded to suggestions to make the expansion work
[1:47:22] miser_o: Maybe now Blizz will be strong enough to pull out sword form azeroth :)
[1:47:34] Dinermoe: theyre woke af Kappa

[1:47:50] psyranx: innovate

[1:48:32] Torse9: PhD in game development
[1:48:34] rbayduden: they are
[1:48:35] Rygothx: Microsoft is only spending 3% of it's total money.  It won't pressure Blizz cut corners to get more dollars in their pocket, MS would has long term goals for the game for sure.
[1:48:36] TheHardcorian: Microsoft will give blizzard hope, fairly happy about this transition as a consumer
[1:48:41] MaaQ: dice is EA
[1:48:43] TheRukis: so what do we call it n0w Microsoft Activision-blizzard?
[1:48:43] rbayduden: i said, IF they where :D

[1:49:34] Twe4ky: Microvision
[1:49:34] joshizaurus: MS Blizzard sounds like a new writing program
[1:49:36] warrenny: Dont see why ppl care it looks good and is resolved
[1:49:45] dustypawsie: Actisoft and Microblizzard
[1:49:45] GreenOut17: its just Microsoft, blizzard is just one of their 30 studios lol
[1:49:46] xxcujozxx: new wow mini game, show off your skills in ms paint
[1:49:46] at1c: Its not a merger. Will work the same as EA and then game studio below/after
[1:49:47] Alegnowar: since they're under the Gaming department at MS it's prob gonna be MS gaming Blizz
[1:49:50] moonshinebilly: As if Microsoft will change
[1:49:53] moonshinebilly: its name
[1:49:59] MrKhanes: Its will just be Microsoft and its sub divions Activions Blizzard, this isnt a merge.
[1:50:01] KaisenSiru: <Microsoft Limit>
[1:50:12] uglymonkey80812: I miss playing with you, always pop in once in a while just to see how ya doing ❤️❤️
[1:50:14] Darwoo: WoW 2.0
[1:50:24] warrenny: Are treyarch and infinity ward affect much by activision or is it just then working on cods?
[1:50:25] Hallwack: i mean without the scandals and lawsuits the share price would have been at 90 dollars, and usually you get a little bit more per share. so definetly would have cost more
[1:50:25] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I hope Ion can log into the game in peace now, poor guy hasn't logged in 5 months
[1:50:27] Dinermoe: mahlunaPanic
[1:50:30] valianya: @towelliee Not like he could have gotten them all.  Azeroth wasn't last living planet in universe.  And nothing stopping Void Lords from sending more directly to Azeroth since they lost the last active one on the planet
[1:50:30] Dempsterr: I expect them to not use Activision
[1:50:34] mageador: When do you think the world of warcraf will come to the game pass?
[1:50:41] TheRukis: dude don't get anyone hopes up.
[1:50:42] dubshotz: i just hope MS doesn't come in here and slash out the classic stuff...i want my WOLK classic
[1:50:51] Jokervenom1978: Hopefully this means a much healthier workplace for all the employees.
[1:51:03] k3ntizZ: The name "Blizzard" will be lost soon...
[1:51:08] Beet4: Conquest!
[1:51:08] Dinermoe: Azerite Kappa
[1:51:11] sigilla_: @jokervenom1978 I hope so too
[1:51:26] Beet4: This time we can be the baddies and invade other worlds
[1:51:36] GRIZZIKK: Interesting to think if there will be any cross-over between Blizzard and Bethesda games, or eastereggs.  Warcraft estereggs in Elder Scrolls, maybe Starcraft easter eggs in Starfield.
[1:51:42] at1c: Microsoft Game studios presents.  Blizzard Entertainment.  (insert game news)
[1:51:45] xxcujozxx: biggest thing tho, we need to fix our own planet and then go to another planet and take their oil kekw coxKappa
[1:51:45] k3ntizZ: This is the end. It was fun while it lasted.
[1:51:46] Redoake: @Towelliee Do you think they will do something similar to blizzcon going forward? Sorry if ur asked this already
[1:51:47] MaaQ: Champion!!!! THE SOUL OF OUR WORLD NEED YA
[1:51:53] seanb4games: To allow the horde and alliance to exist seperately on different planets they take another one they think is empty. But it used to be inhabited and you awake the old old gods of that planet!
[1:52:07] seanb4games: That easy
[1:52:13] valianya: Meteor Old God invasion from space.  We gotta go to Black Empire planet to stop invasion from space.
[1:52:22] madein90ss: lmao new SPORE pog :D
[1:52:33] Autoexeq: Everybody out here thinking this merge is the same as Disney, i.e. putting Mickey Mouse in Star Wars etc. We ain't gonna se WoW in ESO or vice versa
[1:52:37] MaaQ: magni gonna have a day with us
[1:52:47] MaaQ: Magni need to be killed
[1:52:56] sniffsc: Bethesda is also still bethesda under ms
[1:52:58] TheHardcorian: @towelliee did you see the jailer model? I feel a massive let down cinematic on the horizon
[1:53:01] ralecgos: will it still be activision-blizzard or just blizzard now
[1:53:02] Twe4ky: I just hope they won't do something similar to the Eternals movie
[1:53:07] Persephonae: its like how arbys owns bww
[1:53:15] Zettabyte: Microcon? qneLUL

[1:54:46] RenoVR: master chief vs arthus
[1:54:46] yokai_5: me too PepeHands
[1:54:48] Densetsu_: Preach, bring HotS competitive back please!
[1:54:48] valianya: Activision and Blizzard might be more officially separated as individual studio management trees , both reporting separately to Phil
[1:54:52] porowozek: omg please yes. Give HOTS some money and devs
[1:54:54] joshizaurus: Imagine getting a Warthog mount in WoW

[1:56:37] NickFPV: They would have to restructure wow monetization if they put it on game pass. Like WoW might have to do more micro transactions or put in a battlepass
[1:56:45] Torse9: When will Microsoft buy EA
[1:56:46] the_general01: they made that money back before they felt bad losing it

[1:58:18] Beet4: You barely notice that MS owns Bethesda when you play eso
[1:58:26] balanira: wow token to buy fallout 76 rum Kappa
[1:58:43] Persephonae: it makes the most sense to leave blizzard as is, like let them live in their little bubble

[1:59:13] joshizaurus: Asmon was surprised
[1:59:16] Valestrus: @mmo_kenna_ crownstore items can now be looted in game?
[1:59:17] RenoVR: asmon was optmistic
[1:59:20] Warpiercer: I dont think Microsoft will tell developers what to do on the game, Alotugh im sure they'll give them a nice, comfy and safe working enviroment and insurance to Blizzard developers.
[1:59:21] Milanesa_De_Pollo: New PTR this week?
[1:59:25] chrslp: Some douchebag was kicking mirrors off of cars outside my apartment building and he sees me call the cops and ran off. His dumbass pulled back up right as the cops came and I pointed him out and that mf RAN LUL

[2:00:54] sniffsc: invite chat!
[2:01:01] piratechris: As a player of blizzard games I don't think it will be noticeable that Microsoft has bought Blizzard. I think most of the changes will affect the ppl who work for Blizzard tbh. As a consumer we may notice that Blizzard games start running on Microsoft services like Azure etc withe caveats of that.
[2:01:03] mmo_kenna_: @valestrus Microsoft made them change crown crates (Loot Boxes) so you can do daily/weeklys to earn them

[2:02:07] mmo_kenna_: I played ESO for the last year on Series X, it's fantastic but not big on Twitch
[2:02:14] Warpiercer: Xbox Game Pass has regional pricing also, If they include wow sub in it it might be nice for some players around the world
[2:02:17] balanira: yeah
[2:02:24] George2001k: Anyone knows if we will get more followers in the next patch for the mission table?
[2:03:00] 메피스토벤: I hope they won't nerf brew 4 set, its op

[2:07:02] Korupcija_: but 15 on both weeks is 2k score..
[2:07:03] Warpiercer: They wont do cata classic for sure. Classic means ''old azeroth'' in a way before the game rework. Cata isnt old azeroth.
[2:07:07] 1law_chroniclaw357: cataclysm wasnt bad.. Loved the first raids and all. reasonable is Dragon soul raid. but rest all was super including pvp

[2:17:07] xxcujozxx: they could just disable them for crossfaction content, then they won't have to do anything
[2:17:09] Sandisy: just make it a class bonus instead of race based
[2:17:21] Scoodles91: or just a dps racial/ tank racial/ heal racial
[2:17:32] Autoexeq: Cross Faction will handle racials as if you played the "corresponding" race on the other faction. Orc becomes Dwarf. Blood Elf becomes Night Elf racials etc. etc.
[2:17:34] Poprostu: isnt racials like 1%dps?
[2:17:41] Leruxia: It just dawned on me Microsoft now has 2 MMORPGS to look after, they "own" ESO don't they?
[2:17:45] ralecgos: So would Horde and Alliance players be able to join the same Guild? I assume Horde for example wouldn't be able to go into Stormwind right?
[2:17:45] Rudric_Ice: just buff some alliance racials
[2:17:53] swordart_19: no one cares for them outside of e sport players lul

[2:20:01] NickFPV: 9.who
[2:20:04] dalvynthedrunk: I can wait lol, plenty of things going on already in gamin

[2:21:05] xxcujozxx: ok... what addon/weakaura plays the john cena music when bron comes out, i need it
[2:21:08] richgambit: patches just feel too long
[2:21:14] Korupcija_: I thought stacking one stat was boring
[2:21:15] sniffsc: Patch looks good tbh, many classes will be fun
[2:21:18] assman_ny: I always like them near the end
[2:21:23] khazroi: Microsoft Blizzard
[2:21:25] sniffsc: but all those legendaries wil be expensive af
[2:21:40] khazroi: or is it Microsoft Activision Blizzard now?
[2:21:40] iambunta: Dragon isles seems like a cool way to make player characters evil now unless I’m remembering Black dragon lore wrong
[2:21:51] richgambit: XD
[2:21:54] swordart_19: easy to get
[2:21:57] NewWorldReign: sell by date @Towelliee meaning theres no point to the expansion anymore
[2:22:08] JackHealMe: the rune carving gear are going up in price atm
[2:22:11] Korupcija_: just make 235 legendary for alts
[2:22:12] Kelsillium: gold cost on AH
[2:22:14] ThePunishment187: Sup everyone
[2:22:17] Korupcija_: you only need effect
[2:22:19] ImpalerV: the ending to SL is also meaningless for what's coming probably...
[2:22:37] swordart_19: @ImpalerV so clueless OMEGALUL
[2:22:49] khazroi: it doesnt make you wanna play it though
[2:22:51] Kelsillium: if you have a new alt you want to try out with 9.2, thats about 120k gold for the legendaries alone xD
[2:22:54] ralecgos: and we're still in 9.1 lol
[2:23:02] ImpalerV: @swordart_19 right... putting " OMEGALUL " makes you right KEKW
[2:23:10] dalvynthedrunk: Why do yall NEED a 10.0 announcement before 9.2 instead of after lol, xpac will take just as long regardless
[2:23:25] swordart_19: i buy 210 legos EZ
[2:23:33] swordart_19: stop tying to get most expensive ones noobs

[2:23:48] idlethghts: Microsoft deal still needs the go a head from US gov.  especially in a time when said agency is harsher than ever
[2:23:49] swordart_19: @ImpalerV yes pretty much
[2:23:50] Kelsillium: 262 is about 60k per piece
[2:23:53] Uppercutz: sponsored by capitol one

[2:52:27] Vosy1984: Just_Jaybles that I didn't knew, but I know I made the quest in BFA

Chances are though, he'll hold those and sell quarterly. At the same time, most millionaires holding that much in stock keep it and live off the capital gains versus dump it for a quick cash grab

[2:54:52] dugarg_: I do have a few tcg things myself, and yeah it costs quite a bit for sure, the game is really nice even if the expansion is not as good you can always go back and complete things
[2:54:52] whiph: @Towelliee what are u doing in garrison?
[2:55:02] ArkusTV: I have been hard farming mounts since WOD. I helped boost your viewers through curve on alliance EU in HFC and since then I have been farming every mount I can. Currently I am at 627/705 on simple armory
[2:55:04] lookItsJB: @Quakezilla69 There's a shitload to do, the problem is that it's repetitive AF. Dailies/Weeklys/Xmog/Progression/M+ then it comes down to a "hurry up and wait for reset"
[2:56:34] dugarg_: dugarg_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:56:53] lookItsJB: @ugwizard To be honest; I think MSFT bought it to compete with Amazon in the gaming space, versus shutting to down entirely

The suspension was horseshit. I was active 99% of those BGs and a GM told me that I was inactive for "at least a few". So the suspension ended yesterday and I logged back in to find all my honor was taken away.

[3:02:10] RealMelorandor: Cheer200 you acquired something special and it was my heart. Also, Smoky Direwolf was my first Garrison Invasion mount back in WoD it was awesom

[3:09:38] xXSiebzehnXx: Bigger than Disney deals is a big deal
[3:09:40] luckfore: i got them all on 1st try after 9.1.5

[3:09:53] dugarg_: they did increase it by quite a lot
[3:10:07] raiwist: legion was a great expansion

[3:10:23] ralecgos: The worst part of the class mount thing is waiting for the Mission Table ughhh
[3:10:26] loragheta: yeah the bad luck protection for legion paragon mounts is retroactive btw. they increased it with 9.1.5 by a fuckton for each box you had turn/ed in.
[3:10:27] athalon: hunter and DK class mount quests were prob my fav
[3:10:40] iuraotv: hope they actualy do the cross faction thing

[3:11:28] xXSiebzehnXx: I liked the garrison form of recruiting and followers for some reason. Made them feel more alive
[3:11:31] RealWhiski: When will next expansion release? Any clues?
[3:11:39] joontet: Will it be a nightmare to get the new covenant flying mounts as a returning player? Stopped playing at the old renown cap
[3:11:47] Mazkon: Also, easiest as its jsut one mob
[3:11:57] Vosy1984: the gold quests in Legion would give you dailly around 15k at least

[3:24:53] lookItsJB: @Invictus_trax True, but they'd have to release to both XB and PS and I don't see MSFT supporting PS. They'd alienate a huge market just to flex, and lose even more subs as a result (I feel)
[3:24:56] CatliviaTheZombieKitten: @TacoVendor93 To be fair, League doesn't have a lot of established lore for players to read so they need to build it up through a series. WoW has plenty of available lore they can use for movies.

[4:31:13] Thoreya: also is everyone ready for survival to be meta for m+
[4:31:27] Aquadriel: if you dont see the depth in wow, you prolly only do lfr
[4:31:29] frostwolf_86: You've never heard of Ultima Online?
[4:31:44] Rudric_Ice: fuck time to lvl a shaman
[4:31:46] JackHealMe: Enhance has been good all expansion it's just the weird agro pull off their burst
[4:31:57] ClipCraft: i think you're onjly suppose to click those once :P
[4:32:24] frostwolf_86: Oh gotcha

[4:32:53] Vani11aFace: what is the program that manages all addons for wow?
[4:32:58] frostwolf_86: I played Ultima Online in 1999-2004, pretty much all I did was pvp, there were no raids.

[4:34:36] balanira: its starnge there isa no world pvp mount in SL like legion and bfa
[4:34:40] balanira: not even a recolor
[4:34:42] Herzenliegen: Or like in tdc where you tried to poison the Aldor soup,lol
[4:34:46] mmo_kenna_: WoW mount races...race your favourite mounts against other players around tracks with power ups
[4:34:49] Zenfar_: BFA did a lot for world pvp as well
[4:34:50] dyslexican1: The only people who really like outdoor pvp is Rouges and Druids that stealth and gank people then run away and stealth again.
[4:34:51] Herzenliegen: TBC
[4:34:53] volkov_lol: It feels somehow that every expansion the bad guy's power level is increased vastly like dragon ball z kinda thing
[4:35:02] Herzenliegen: No
[4:35:09] Herzenliegen: it was a quest line
[4:35:12] TheUnknowing: was just a quest
[4:35:43] Herzenliegen: Would have been funny if had been players though.
[4:35:56] mmo_kenna_: I couldn't get anything done in BFA because world PVP was so fun
[4:36:23] volkov_lol: I'd love to see the Tinker Class or ssomething like a tank caster idk

[4:37:49] Redpandalol: Let’s be real wpvp is dead and trash. It’s never gonna be fair so no one likes it imo
[4:37:53] Herzenliegen: @zodd_amhai in classic it was all people did in stv,lol
[4:37:56] fat_european0: The supply drops in Nazjatar caused a lot of world pvp
[4:38:17] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Warden tower PVP was great in Legion imo
[4:38:18] Pigbottom: I don't know. personaly there is no reward that would make me pvp
[4:38:19] volkov_lol: Nazjatar pvp was pretty dope
[4:38:26] mmo_kenna_: Nazj constantly had battles from horde base to alliance base too

[4:38:57] mmo_kenna_: I havnt done any PvP in SL, BFA I did a shit load
[4:38:58] Simmo_rs: Korthia had some but not a heap
[4:39:07] Herzenliegen: As I got older no reward really made me want to pvp
[4:39:11] azzurrin: Legion PvP world towers were the best!
[4:39:11] fat_european0: They have a giant colosseum in Maldraxxus and didn't make any cool pvp event around it
[4:39:18] mrniceguy817: Last time I had fun in pvp was legion world quest that little arena where that turned free for all haha that was fun
[4:39:27] mortepheus: they need to structure a reward system and then do away with war mode
[4:39:27] volkov_lol: Maybe increase the amount of honor or even gain conquest by just killing people outdoors?
[4:39:29] mmo_kenna_: I queued up for arathi blizzard the other day, couldn't get a group
[4:39:30] Fortuon: If they add more pvp stuff better upgrade the servers also :/
[4:39:55] swanny85: Hope they're not wetter near the servers! #shocking
[4:39:57] fat_european0: Just regular instanced pvp has low participation. World pvp has even less
[4:40:07] Aquadriel: @Towelliee then again most pvpers only want to log in and queue for bgs/arenas... so why do world pvp/activities when pvpers hate that.
[4:40:10] Milanesa_De_Pollo: We need solo queue rbgs
[4:40:12] fat_european0: Classic proved to lots of people that world pvp just sucks
[4:40:23] datcreepa: and griefing is just boring
[4:40:37] andybakes: any links for your UI bro
[4:40:46] volkov_lol: World pvp back in the day was amazing
[4:40:48] zodd_amhai: PVP while leveling was the most fun in STV was glorious
[4:40:49] fat_european0: I have ptsd from playing Alliance during phase 2
[4:40:52] Screamnsteam: World pvp owns because theres no rules
[4:41:01] mmo_kenna_: BFA proved that world PvP can be amazing
[4:41:09] dutchie76: boy i miss the Southshore/Tarren mills dayz
[4:41:35] volkov_lol: @Towelliee do you think just "removing" or doing factions a different way might get more people?
[4:41:37] milorgpvp: true peak of mmos was wildstar - changemymind, so sad the servers are off :(
[4:41:41] dutchie76: came home from work and the war was still going on
[4:41:52] fat_european0: People just took it to the extreme this time though. Took hours to get our raid into MC because of the perma ganking
[4:42:12] Velashen: competitive pvpers tend to play other genres instead
[4:42:13] piratechris: Yeah but the MMO PvPers get louder and louder even as their numbers decrease.
[4:42:15] Kinghorn: ok I just woke up did sony buy ubisoft or are we safe
[4:42:25] dutchie76: @fat_european0 should of seen the Blackwing Lair ganking

[4:42:39] reverbsoul1: PvP problem has PvP solution
[4:42:50] Kinghorn: imagine playing on a pvp server FeelsWeirdMan
[4:42:54] fat_european0: @dutchie76 We had some guy go around multiboxing loads of mages just wiping teams with Arcane Explosion spams
[4:43:01] fat_european0: was awful LUL
[4:43:03] dutchie76: lol
[4:43:06] onybear: Classic was a pita with getting ganked
[4:43:14] dutchie76: i miss 3 day Alterac Valley
[4:43:18] milorgpvp: The thing that really put me off classic, esp after hitting 60, was the whole world buff thing. I dont know why people wanna spend hours getting buffs to raid for 15 minutes, instead of just raiding for 1-2 hours

[4:43:50] Coldlight1: trueeeee
[4:44:00] fat_european0: Yeah true. If I was a PvP oriented player i'd play a different game if i'm honest
[4:44:07] fat_european0: Eventho I enjoy wow arenas
[4:44:47] Thoreya: wow arenas is unique to any other pvp system thats why arenas will always have a niche community
[4:44:54] dutchie76: a lot of Survival games nowadays too
[4:44:57] Cthulian: Agree
[4:45:03] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Rift monkaS
[4:45:08] Thoreya: i know personally a lot of people that would hop into wow arena again if the barrier of entry wasnt so steep
[4:45:08] Coldlight1: i wish i enjoyed WoWs pvp, but the raiding is great if you have a guild to play with. Im so excited for Lost Ark though.
[4:45:13] Tuna_Bucket: Daoc!
[4:45:14] dutchie76: dont forget Archeage LUL

[4:45:39] Tuna_Bucket: dark age of camelot
[4:45:40] Alepouditsa: i was playing maple story
[4:45:46] DaKevin10: RuneScape
[4:45:48] Just_Jaybles: you gonna play legacy of the sith towel?
[4:45:50] Coldlight1: Aion, Lineage 2, WoW, EverQuest
[4:45:52] EASanDiego: FF11
[4:45:55] QQuirashi: gimme a warhammer 40k mmo and im gucci forever
[4:45:58] dutchie76: i liked wildstar
[4:46:00] Coldlight1: ff11 woops
[4:46:02] pankeysz: Albion Online GOAT
[4:46:03] swanny85: Yeah I got into MMO's with Everquest but went to WoW around WoTLK and enjoyed it.
[4:46:04] reverbsoul1: Warcraft made MMORPGs accessible.
[4:46:04] Kinghorn: oh yeah ff11
[4:46:06] Coldlight1: wildstar was fun for a bit
[4:46:08] Kinghorn: grinding crabs
[4:46:12] Kinghorn: in the dunes
[4:46:13] dutchie76: rift was eh
[4:46:13] Thoreya: i played a lot of OSRS and maple story
[4:46:18] dutchie76: guild wars was good
[4:46:19] Kriven: dark and light, horizons, darkfall, shadowbane LUL
[4:46:19] Thoreya: and then halo/cod
[4:46:21] Sevaar87: EQ is the Goat tbf. With how many xpacs it has.
[4:46:33] Thoreya: xbox live took over wow for me :(
[4:46:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: i mean they had chuck norris advertising their game, how do you top that?
[4:46:39] fat_european0: I don't think any other MMO has gotten close to wow's peak either
[4:46:43] KingsandClubs: I was playing shadow lands LUL
[4:46:44] dutchie76: Wrath expac is still my favorite
[4:46:55] JackHealMe: Wish i wasnt a child at that time
[4:46:58] dutchie76: always will be
[4:47:03] fat_european0: I think it was last year lots of people were talking about the article that supposedly showed wow vs FF14 numbers. All I could think of was how crazy it was that wow used to have 12 mill before
[4:47:11] balanira: on that time i was playing dota 1 on warcraft 3 client
[4:47:18] Rudric_Ice: New World could've been so good but at least they are improving it
[4:47:19] mmo_kenna_: Wrath was my peak, dunno if it'll be the same going back tho I like new stuff
[4:47:22] Thoreya: bless up
[4:47:47] Milanesa_De_Pollo: How is Rift still alive?
[4:47:48] dutchie76: i just liked Northrend
[4:47:57] at1c: Legion is my peak of wow. Wrath had good ideas and some really bad ideas.
[4:47:58] Razzalghuul: Towelliee the GOAT
[4:47:59] dutchie76: one of the best continents imo
[4:48:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: and if it goes to gamepass it will technically shatter their record Kappa
[4:48:28] KingsandClubs: frozen throne battle.net for the win
[4:48:29] Sicknessqt: Need another legion
[4:48:29] fat_european0: @mmo_kenna_ MoP was peak wow for me, I hope Blizzard releases a Classic version for it as well and doesn't stop after Wrath
[4:48:38] Rudric_Ice: LOTR came out with a new expansion
[4:48:46] Sabopotamus: when i started playin in bc, terrin mill and south shore werent about honor really, world pvp was about revenge for ganking someomes alt :D @Towelliee
[4:48:48] Razzalghuul: feel like that was more of a sheep
[4:48:53] Screamnsteam: monkaS
[4:48:58] belfastcl: mmos don't need all that much people to stay around, lotro had 100k monthly average users and 41k subs, and they still churn out expansions (daybreak-eg7 quarterly data 2019)
[4:49:00] Kinghorn: flying round in circles
[4:49:00] volkov_lol: Imagine the sheer amount of people if they reduce the sub price to idk 10 bucks at least
[4:49:08] dutchie76: i think they are stopping at classic wrath imo
[4:49:08] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Best case scenario, is 11.0 being included in game pass, similar to ESO expansions.
[4:49:09] Shoebacca28: Its silly to say it wont go to game pass. MSoft will do it its guaranteed
[4:49:11] PokerFaceMoose: I can see it in your eyes, I can feel it in your touch
[4:49:13] Shoebacca28: they want everyone on gamepass
[4:49:23] MagikMerlin: only way its coming to gamepass is its going to be a dated version of WoW (past expansions)
[4:49:37] MagikMerlin: + they would increase the pass cost
[4:49:43] Viracityz: ^
[4:49:45] mortepheus: SHEEP
[4:49:54] mortepheus: NPCs
[4:49:59] Shoebacca28: look at the money they lost on Age 4 by putting it on the game pass.... None, they probably made more from it being there lol
[4:50:00] Silverwards: lol fuck them, make new firends
[4:50:13] fat_european0: I do wonder why wow has so many haters though. I understand quitting & wanting to play what's hip, but spending so much time & energy hating on wow is so weird to me
[4:50:16] BackwardsCompatible: I used to be afraid that the time I sunk into a non popular mmo would be wasted if they killed the game
[4:50:22] reverbsoul1: Lowering the cost to get more people only makessense if you make more money. To lower they price 30% they would have to grow the audience 50% to make it worthwhile
[4:50:31] Alepouditsa: btw do we need 80 renown for 9.2 coz i am moving server and still lvling alts so i only have it at 50+
[4:50:40] wrckingball: @fat_european0 people want their choices validated
[4:50:44] dutchie76: Lost Ark is going to keep people busy for a longggggggggggg time
[4:51:02] belfastcl: small pvp communities in mmos are crazy, some people in there have had grudged with each other for years

[5:33:34] pavepawns: would boomer blast instead of having very lively colors just be plain grey to promote boomer power?
[5:33:35] cabalish: buy a egg for green protodrake chance
[5:33:43] cstone94: Cata was so fun
[5:33:46] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: 3
[5:33:49] Ordicos: 3
[5:33:51] mavericks312: cata raiding was so good imo
[5:33:53] pacificmc1: cata is underrated
[5:34:00] TheCliffyShow: 4 if you include Baradin Hold.
[5:34:00] Aquadriel: baradin hold bosses too
[5:34:14] pronkk_: chogall was in BoT
[5:34:16] r0b928: Tol borad
[5:34:20] ashwing_: you had Cho Gall as well in Cata
[5:34:32] TheCliffyShow: Toweldorei I think.
[5:34:33] Dalsonson: BoT had ChoGall
[5:34:38] Elff11: We had so many epic bosses in catac,  Ragnaros Deathwing Sinestra Al'Akir Nefarian
[5:34:41] Acidwalk: What is your total /played?
[5:34:50] Aravarth: I fucking LOVED Firelands
[5:34:53] DallTV_: me 2
[5:34:55] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I liked dragon soul
[5:35:00] Plague_GG: Sinestra was the first Heroic only boss right?
[5:35:01] pacificmc1: I liked DS too
[5:35:05] PadidinJones: Spine is a pain in the ass
[5:35:07] pavepawns: would you even consider throne a proper raid? i personally always find al akir so depressing
[5:35:08] mavericks312: DS was cool
[5:35:10] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: best raid of the expansion
[5:35:10] iuraotv: dragon soul was the start of LFR wasnt it? maybe cause of it
[5:35:12] Elff11: I still got PTSD of progessing Spine of Deathwing on 25 HC xD
[5:35:13] Aquadriel: people just hate on cataclysm because of LFR lmao
[5:35:18] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee I think Dragon Soul gets a lot of hate nowadays because it is shit to farm because of spine
[5:35:20] pixxelina: fuck spine
[5:35:22] MrFck36: spine is so ass
[5:35:37] MrFck36: even now it sucks lmao
[5:35:42] gdtomii: monkaS
[5:35:43] CmacLOL: I remember the Vodka vs BL dragon soul race.
[5:35:44] pacificmc1: spine wasn't that bad
[5:35:45] Plague_GG: If Madness would've lived up to the hype then people would love Cataclysm
[5:35:45] dyslexican1: Spine was a guild killer. In just MHO. My guild at the time broke up cus of it.
[5:35:46] cahoots82: I've only done spine solo, I feel like that fight would be torture in actual raid
[5:35:49] cabalish: that fight is a real team effort
[5:35:50] Acidwalk: Spine just required so much coordination and was super frustrating
[5:35:55] xxcujozxx: spine could die in a fire
[5:36:14] Dalsonson: You snapped at Sparty??
[5:36:18] pavepawns: i personally didnt like spine and the battleship fights. else i didnt mind dragon soul
[5:36:22] kerrekerra: gonna name my new wow char frappofucko
[5:36:24] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: spine you had to stack rogues and mages

[5:36:37] falldrgn: DS was great.. the last 2 sucked
[5:36:45] TheCliffyShow: I liked Cataclysm. I quit during that expansion but there's was a lot of factors to that.
[5:36:52] Contravert: @Towelliee which expansion had the best raids?
[5:36:53] szble: i missed early cata :/
[5:36:58] fat_european0: I dislike all the pop culture references, but overall it was pretty fun
[5:37:01] lalelusa: it also tied in with the lore
[5:37:09] Aquadriel: @Towelliee guild perks were the shit too, mass summon Kreygasm
[5:37:09] falldrgn: Vengance.. lol
[5:37:11] szble: blood dks monkaW
[5:37:11] dugarg_: especially warriors on aoe

[5:37:15] Acidwalk: Cata was great expansion, returning to azeroth was awesome. Hopefully they do something like that again.
[5:37:19] dugarg_: that shit was crazy
[5:37:26] pacificmc1: Cataclysm was good except Deepholm, fuck that zone :D

[5:38:06] pavepawns: im still sad overall wod went as it did. cause it had my favorite raids in it
[5:38:08] Aravarth: I mean, yeah... they had to redesign Azeroth entirely
[5:38:14] TheCliffyShow: Man, I wish I came back for Legion. I tried but money issues.

[5:39:37] mmrghost7: @geros2013 u mean maintaining threat ?
[5:39:37] geros2013: everyone
[5:39:41] brewsuadeshoes: 3 raids to start in Cata was awesome, imo. Really enjoyed those
[5:39:42] OhNoNotAgain: we were talking about Tahanto

[5:40:29] pronkk_: no Sabriel
[5:40:32] Aquadriel: tahonta needs lvl 3 stitchyard
[5:40:36] thetorque162: Tahonta is 1/250 drop rate
[5:40:48] TheCliffyShow: I was disappointed when 9.0 wasn't Dragon Isles. In hindsight, I'm glad it wasn't now.
[5:41:04] volkov_lol: Towel where's a good place (exp) to get a lot of toys quick?
[5:41:18] brewsuadeshoes: I do too
[5:41:23] mmrghost7: hmm
[5:41:35] pacificmc1: I wish they would also just re-use assets more... PAtch 3.3 brought 3 new dungeons, same assets sure, but it was sick instead of getting 1 new dungeon every expansion at best
[5:41:40] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: mop had 16 total
[5:41:51] mmrghost7: yeah i guess its good for the eye
[5:42:03] EASanDiego: wish we got abyssal maw in cata
[5:42:04] Kratosjr1: Kratosjr1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 62 months! hey
[5:42:17] Aravarth: Yeah, I agree. Not mini-raids, but like Medium Raids, and have 3 of them. Same amount of bosses as a "Big Raid", but gives people a change of scenery.
[5:42:30] evillocks: I hope they bring back Artifact weapons if we ever face off with the Void

[5:43:23] drmabusee: the level zones are great
[5:43:25] TheCliffyShow: @kronosIII I agree with you. I rather be on Azeroth to. Reason I'm glad it was Shadowlands instead of Dragon Isles is because all the shit like Covid and lawsuits, hurt Shadowlands and not Dragon Isles.
[5:43:27] pacificmc1: I want a new zone like STV

[5:46:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: degen it
[5:46:50] TheCliffyShow: @kronosIII I liked the general gameplay of Shadowlands, but they fucked the lore up pretty good. And, the Jailer sucks so much as a villian. Also, it reveals to much about the inner workings of the world. Mystery is good to have in a fantasy world.
[5:47:04] pacificmc1: @Towelliee https://imgur.com/a/SJb3TWc did you ever see these btw? They are in 9.1s files... Hinting to a world revamp, or at the very least, graphics update in the old world?
[5:47:28] Plague_GG: Do you think it would be possible to have multiple raids, but still only have one last boss? Like all 3 raids end at one boss. @towelliee

[5:48:47] MrFck36: I cant wait for Blazing drake to drop so i never need to do DS again.
[5:48:56] TheCliffyShow: @kronosIII They did her arc so bad. Also, when the first raid's final boss is vastly more interesting then the big bad of the whole expansion, you have a problem.
[5:48:57] swordart_19: @joontet early 2023

[5:50:05] Korupcija_: I can't believe they wont give us 80 renown token

[6:42:34] SickduckTTV: @Towelliee  do you remember the quest from legion goddess watch over you? where wee have to get the tear of elune in val'shara

[6:44:12] Aquadriel: hope housing is through the new mobile game, i just wanna see the world burn @Towelliee
[6:44:15] Mecabeast: I'd like to see maybe guild housing but not player it'd be really rough on servers I think
[6:44:17] bruhSit_farmer: true
[6:44:18] notdustinx: Ability to level and craft all professions
[6:44:22] tebbix: @SickduckTTV isn't the tear of elune given to you after a dungeion when you free Malfurion
[6:44:29] Narkuwar: the housing was a part of blizzard hame from the begining like warcraft  3 starcraft its contreyctions gamers
[6:44:30] ijuki: @hjo1992 Are you Swedish by any chance?
[6:44:34] ChimmyNeutron: WoW tokens have severely hurt professions.
[6:44:45] Aidler: any profession
[6:44:46] comp1: change fishing to something like new world
[6:44:47] digital_mallrat: how much of a mixup is M$ buying Blizzard even going to be? don't they tend to take a hands off approach, but help with financing
[6:44:48] bruhSit_farmer: @ijuki nope australian :P
[6:44:57] TheGiant99: Make WoW professions like New World professions
[6:45:00] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @hjo1992 crikey
[6:45:01] Rudric_Ice: i don't care about housing but we can renew city hubs like Gilneas and other cities that they forgot about
[6:45:10] Scoodles91: they were semi relevant last expansion when you could have crafted bis item
[6:45:11] EdgyMemeBear: If they did player housing they could make professions able to craft stuff for it?
[6:45:14] LawrenceDreamer: Did you do the Endwalker msq?
[6:45:16] junkquip: which mount is it for?
[6:45:17] ijuki: @hjo1992 Your nickname is the name of the "town" I was born in, that's why :)
[6:45:19] Narkuwar: someone can tell what his farming?
[6:45:38] bruhSit_farmer: @ijuki oh thats nice :D
[6:45:40] onybear: It would be nice if professions were relevant again….and you could craft things like gear that were good for longer like they did back in the day
[6:45:43] DMordak: I do hope they try and keep Crash and Spyro alive.
[6:45:45] Narkuwar: @junkquip same question
[6:45:49] assman_ny: And give a little extra time if needed
[6:45:56] Kriven: man this rasp iced tea gfuel is great.

[6:46:24] DBMambo: good thing they didnt do that with Halo Kappa
[6:46:28] garamis82: You mean how Blizzard used to operate?
[6:46:28] bladdes_00: whip the employees !!! :P
[6:46:31] HopeThePriest: I dont know about that
[6:46:34] magiccanvashands: @Towelliee if you think Microsoft does not have deadlines they keep your mistaken
[6:46:38] mavericks312: probably being the keyword
[6:46:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: COPIUM OD
[6:46:44] glory_toon: @Towelliee any idea who will be filling the shoes of bobby (is it phill?) or do they have someone else coming in to sit below him ?
[6:46:45] Mecabeast: I mean it took 6yrs to dev halo infinite since halo 5 release
[6:46:48] Sikkbass: Copium
[6:46:49] Kyletyldesley: I hope thats how it works
[6:46:49] Kriven: ybarra and phil go way back anyways so i see it as a good think for blizzard
[6:46:50] cordawg: Ion H. needs to go.  dont talk about him.
[6:46:53] thetorque162: thetorque162 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Hybridsteve! 
[6:46:54] pixxelina: LUL
[6:46:55] Eran_21: thats so ideal
[6:46:55] Angusito: blizzard has 1 year and half before be in microsoft
[6:46:56] Kriven: thing*
[6:46:58] Fortunato_22: Throw out a store mount too!
[6:46:59] enux337: add a store mount to help pay for it then lol
[6:47:00] Karnivor___: 40 million for what? hiring more pregnant ladies?
[6:47:02] TheFamousManiac: LOL that last scenario sounded so accurate
[6:47:03] Rudric_Ice: New class Carpentry, Spec Woodcutting
[6:47:03] Roaringkittylol: Ion def needs to go
[6:47:12] tebbix: Yeah the Ybarra and Phil relationship gives me hope
[6:47:14] Moodiir: i dont think itll be like that.. but itll be close to it
[6:47:24] SirDoder: i disagree. blizzard  needs a rebuild. wow alone so many game systems are broken or underdeveloped and get minor fixes maybe once per xpac. coming from a major dev team, what blizz shows for wow is amateur hour
[6:47:26] unresolved_broccoli: no
[6:47:27] mikejames01: not till next year
[6:47:30] OmgItsEdizzle: OmgItsEdizzle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[6:47:30] MILESkg21: probably not
[6:47:30] Sambhur: Takeover 2023
[6:47:30] dugarg_: not yet
[6:47:31] 無職提督: not yet
[6:47:33] Kriven: not till it clears
[6:47:33] HbcMomo: how many mounts are you up to?
[6:47:37] Kavieonn: People keep saying call of duty not going to be on playstation anymore, is that legit?
[6:47:37] Fraggo10: I don't think so, not until the deal is complete
[6:47:38] pixxelina: not yet they need to finalize
[6:47:39] DMordak: Not until like June I heard.
[6:47:40] mikejames01: june 2023
[6:47:41] lalelusa: it's a shame so many offices all over the world had to close. at least there's a slither of hope that MS might reopen some
[6:47:41] Suligane: not unless it's signed yeah
[6:47:42] legendesi: 2023
[6:47:46] AltChillUP_: why not?
[6:47:48] Ivan_all_Good: Crazy to think bungie separated  themselves from Activision. Now this happens
[6:47:48] thenormalbeast: Hum, I think Ian and the team already made plenty of mistakes, I don't think Microsoft will allow more than 1 blunder.
[6:47:49] JackHealMe: Not until the money is settled
[6:47:52] dugarg_: not until the contract is finished
[6:47:54] cstone94: Sure they can!
[6:47:56] 2naDlisch: They can give suggestions
[6:47:59] Shaele: @Towelliee officially they are not allowed, but in reality they already have a say
[6:48:03] Roaringkittylol: They need to gut the game design team on WoW and bring in some fresh blood. Maybe leave 1 or two just for the experience but that's about it.
[6:48:09] Korupcija_: I love that song
[6:48:10] FiftykBolt: @Towelliee Were you gonna do that massive grind for the infinite timereaver now with Wrath TW?
[6:48:14] eyeztea: they can but it will be donation and they get no profits yet
[6:48:19] anon_mir: why wouldnt they give money to company that eventually will be theirs?
[6:48:26] Sikkbass: They will most likely still give Activision the autonomy to carry on itself, it's just an acquisition so is done to take a bigger share of the market.  Stuff rarely changes unless something is really broken
[6:48:26] MeisterPetze: 10.0 leak... the creeper islands
[6:48:28] Ldysansa: That is not true. It depends on what was out lined in the negotiation
[6:48:30] Mazeltough: @Towelliee fiscal year 2023 starts July 1, 2022 so the deal could go down any time after that
[6:48:31] ChimmyNeutron: Microsoft: Ion give the people want they want... More interviews.
[6:48:37] mavericks312: i mean the seperation basically saved D2
[6:48:39] Mecabeast: I mean bungie worked hard to get away from Microsoft at the cost of losing the halo ip
[6:48:43] pacificmc1: on it
[6:48:46] cordawg: !leaks
[6:48:46] Suligane: they don't lol they love being on their own

[6:48:49] MILESkg21: KEKW
[6:48:51] Aidler: they can give suggestions that are not really only suggestions and they can of course gift blizzard money
[6:48:52] Roaringkittylol: Ion and his interviewws are funny
[6:48:56] Kavieonn: Is it true that Diablo 4 is coming to Xbox Gamepass? @Towelliee
[6:48:57] MeisterPetze: the milk expension?
[6:48:57] instant_savage: 10.0 rise of the masterchief
[6:49:02] CaptainJoeyNY: New Masterchief Tinkerer heritage Armor

[6:49:15] lalelusa: 10.0 leak: Fall of the Trade Prince
[6:49:21] 3663Sharad: Amazon released a traielr for the LotR Series (Title Announcement)
[6:49:24] 3663Sharad: POGGERS
[6:49:28] Roaringkittylol: They need to implement the Master Chief class
[6:49:41] MeisterPetze: World of Warcraft: The Milk of the Slaves
[6:49:47] Tegger37: Been involved in mergers in the past.  They would be hands off until closed.
[6:49:54] Ldysansa: Yes they could have a say in how game design and published
[6:49:55] SirDoder: if i was microsoft and what blizz has delivered the past years, i'd keep my hands off of everything and not get burned for no reason at all
[6:49:57] EdgyMemeBear: Master Chief transmog toy Kappa
[6:49:58] Tegger37: cause it might not close
[6:49:59] relios898: The merger could theoretically be completed sooner than June 2023 but a year and a half is already pretty tight
[6:49:59] Zerksyera: in past transactions simular to the purchase of activision blizzard. Microsoft hasnt interfereed
[6:50:00] Sikkbass: Microsoft is going to prioritise their portfolio, Blizzard is pretty low down but COD will win heavy from this as it's the most popular
[6:50:15] slyduck0: IF microsoft take Blizzard, I'll start playing again
[6:50:20] Roaringkittylol: World of Warcraft: The Breastmilk Brotherhood
[6:50:21] CaptainJoeyNY: Imagine a little Grunt companion that yells "Theyre everywhere"
[6:50:27] Kavieonn: If you are subscribed to gamepass does that let with play wow without a subscription?
[6:50:38] Big_Wanshan: what happened to new world lol
[6:50:38] CaptainJoeyNY: Wow on Xbox gamepass would be sick
[6:50:43] senseofpurpose90: @Towelliee how much will be the boeing 787 max mount in wow? will it crash with your guild in it? will it happen?  too soon?
[6:50:43] 3663Sharad: @Kavieonn Nobody knows
[6:50:48] DMordak: I do hate they've let Banjo just rot in the back.
[6:50:49] CaptainJoeyNY: only have to pay one $14 sub
[6:50:57] dugarg_: @slyduck0 why if, it's already happening, better sub already :D
[6:51:03] mikejames01: wow om gamepass ultimate
[6:51:06] mikejames01: On
[6:51:07] OathXP: which achievement is this?
[6:51:07] HbcMomo: how many mounts do you have now?
[6:51:17] cabalish: it is 29 days total
[6:51:23] Aquadriel: molten front was such a fun daily hub
[6:51:24] mavericks312: @DMordak yea its a shame xbox is never gonna touch banjo anymore
[6:51:33] yadungoofed101: the only way they'd put it on gamepass is with an additional subscription like they do with ESO
[6:51:44] onybear: What mounts did get today?
[6:51:56] Blah206: Even if Microsoft doesn't directly interfere. I'd say just the change in leadership is a boost in morale for most devs. And Mike's relationship with Phil is probably a win.
[6:52:14] Mecabeast: @mavericks312 so many memories playing Kazooie and tooie
[6:52:16] Lexi__Marie: back again with the have you checked for halaa tokens reminder
[6:52:19] instant_savage: did u get the heyna yet from the middle of mal
[6:52:22] totallykile: wow vanilla classic should be ftp if they include anything with gamepass that goes with wow
[6:52:26] slyduck0: @dugarg_ I ignored WoW since the last horrible happenings. This is my first WoW stream I've enetered in months and months. Are they actually taking blizz?
[6:52:26] Aidler: they will make a mount that can transport all 609 mounts of Towelliee in it
[6:52:40] senseofpurpose90: @Towelliee squareenix already rejected several buyout offers, will they concede and join sony?
[6:52:44] balancedlight: once upon a time it was considered Huge
[6:52:45] lalelusa: in comparison to modern zones, yes, but back then, they seemed big
[6:52:48] mavericks312: @Mecabeast unfortunetly rare wont be able to work on anything outside of sea of thieves
[6:52:59] xxcujozxx: it was a really small daily zone but it was really good for a daily hub imo
[6:53:01] dugarg_: @slyduck0 yes they are buying blizzard, it will take time to see the changes, but things are looking promising with Microsoft :)
[6:53:03] Angusito: they can add different ways to pay wow subscription incluid xbox pass, i pretty sure the token going to die
[6:53:22] westelan_: any fresh thoughts on the buyout
[6:53:26] ijuki: @mavericks312 I think Rare is working on a Perfect Dark game though
[6:53:40] TheGiant99: I like collecting mounts but when I start I realize I won't even use them then stop
[6:53:43] Screamnsteam: New map in CoD, it will be Bill Gates Epstien island LUL
[6:53:51] H0bbitK1ng: i dont think the token matters if the sub is part of gamepass
[6:54:04] slyduck0: @dugarg_ That's amazing news. Hopefully all existing management will be fired. Until then I'm gonna stick to my studies.
[6:54:07] yadungoofed101: the sub isnt going to be part of gamepass...
[6:54:10] ijuki: Well, I got a Playstation 5 Kappa
[6:54:10] Aidler: microsoft will create MS-Crypto to replace the tokens
[6:54:11] TakeThatBack: The article I read said this buy will go on for another 18 months?
[6:54:15] senseofpurpose90: @Towelliee plot twist, microsoft closes everything expect candy crush based on economic analytics
[6:54:18] hypexsauce_: micro transactions of always killed games
[6:54:19] Seymourbutts989: Hello
[6:54:20] mavericks312: if anyone buys SE its will be sony cause of the asia fanbase
[6:54:20] lalelusa: maybe the next big deal won't be a buy out but a merger
[6:54:24] MILESkg21: then just delete the tokoen SeemsGood
[6:54:26] sinlesssinner: warcraft 4 INC
[6:54:29] MILESkg21: token*
[6:54:37] yadungoofed101: exactly
[6:54:45] Muaytitus: think this means no more BlizzCon? @Towelliee
[6:54:46] anon_mir: but bethesda hasnt done shit after bought by microsoft
[6:54:48] totallykile: wows business model has been working just fine on the making money side
[6:54:50] dugarg_: @slyduck0 most of the management is already gone due to the scandals, but yeah study is important
[6:54:57] mikejames01: they got bethesda last year
[6:54:57] totallykile: i doubt theyd change anything
[6:54:58] Ldysansa: If it isn't broken don't fix it
[6:55:07] mavericks312: @arya_fart te almighty starfield is coming though lol
[6:55:09] Mecabeast: token will be Microsoft points, expansion on game pass and sub still 15 a month or increase to xbox live gold is my prediction
[6:55:17] theszoti: @arya_fart didn't they just released an xpac for eso?
[6:55:27] S1appadabass: gamepass is the tits
[6:55:34] Strayer_J: 2-3 years?? its been like 1 year since bethesda buyout closeout
[6:55:34] H0bbitK1ng: i tend to agree, the community is set on this gamepass thing
[6:55:35] Karnivor___: most ppl just play one game
[6:55:36] magiccanvashands: @Towelliee why are you all of a sudden on the xbox train?
[6:55:36] anon_mir: @arya_fart yes but i was thinking like actually new games
[6:55:40] mikejames01: @arya_fart they do a expac every year ..last year was one this year will be a new one
[6:55:42] Kavieonn: True
[6:55:47] Kavieonn: Microsoft gotta make that money
[6:55:48] MILESkg21: cuz why spend 20 when you can spend 10 ?
[6:55:51] Blah206: If it's not directly on gamepass, it might be a game pass perk
[6:55:52] luckfore: alot of ppl who already have game pass will have the possibilty to try out wow
[6:55:56] Shearkahn: I thiunk you flip it/   if you are subbed to WOW then you get the game pass
[6:55:59] dugarg_: Pretty sure they will lower the wow subscription if you have game pass, orrrr they will increase the wow sub and give you free game pass

[6:56:31] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: wow doesnt make money. they bought it for cod most likely

[6:56:59] yadungoofed101: @stealth2100 lol this acquisition had nothing to even do with wow.... this is about candy crush and some of the other IPs they bought
[6:57:07] Calphurnious: Millions of WoW subscribers having access to hundreds of other games, they might pay for things in the other games they're trying
[6:57:13] ijuki: Mobile prints money in Asia

[7:19:45] chrslp: Bully sticks are best for dogs that slowly chew. It softens as it gets wet with slobber. If your dog just tries to chomp through them, might not be best

[7:25:29] arturiuss44: They said the same thing about Brady when comparing him to Manning early on in their careers so we will need to wait and see.

[7:27:21] lalelusa: barkbox OR pupjoy - wouldn't wanna spoil her too much
[7:27:22] xhale2nhale: I enjoyed it from a fantasy viewer pov

[7:28:08] RetiredNavyVet: @Towelliee rereading the series again; TV series is nothing like the books; I mean, so much is happening in the books it would be near impossible to do on TV.  I enjoy the series even though it kinda frustrates me when things are different than the books.
[7:28:15] JStevenson: but overall a good show
[7:28:19] ne0rmatrix: I have read all the books in the wheel of time. TV show diverged a lot but I liked it.
[7:28:23] bladdes_00: amazon lotr will be the story before
[7:28:28] elfenaka: before that
[7:28:30] wimpswork: that sounds like events from Silmarillion

[7:28:38] Aldasaris: The Last Alliance of Elves and Men
[7:28:38] valianya: The kids are a lot younger in the books
[7:28:39] JackHealMe: Full drama, a friend of mine was lined up to DIT it when it was supposed to be in Scotland but New Zealand talked them into coming back
[7:28:40] lalelusa: even before that - when the rings were forged and handed out
[7:28:41] 3663Sharad: so more the making if the rings prolly
[7:28:45] Acidwalk: Second age
[7:28:46] Brodih_: yes the First age and the 2nd age... the movies are at the end of the 3rd age
[7:28:48] Rudric_Ice: I heard they were adding sex scenes i hope its not too much what  GOT  did where it adds nothing to the story
[7:28:53] antphilosophy: everyone wants to replicate GoT
[7:28:59] koska666: creation of the ring
[7:29:01] LunarbladeDK: @arturiuss44 indeed, me neither i'm looking forward to it
[7:29:02] bladdes_00: is going to be BETWEEN   The Hobbit and LotR
[7:29:03] Armdel: when Aragorn and Legolas had an affair
[7:29:18] PToastman: Elrond will hang dong, confirmed

[7:29:32] lalelusa: I'm just looking forward to Vkings Valhalla and The Boys S3
[7:29:35] mavericks312: short season meta
[7:29:41] LUKA_THIM: good show
[7:29:44] xhale2nhale: 8-13 episode

[7:30:12] chuckiethegreat: no it takes place many many years after vikings
[7:30:17] snackbacon: I feel like if you have 20 episodes, you're going to have something like the old DBZ when Goku took an entire episode to power up a spirit bomb
[7:30:19] lalelusa: yeah. the trailer is on Netflix. It's about 100 years or so after Vikings
[7:30:20] xhale2nhale: nah it takes place after the Original Viking TV series
[7:30:26] Blah206: Vikings Valhala Feb.25
[7:30:29] Rudric_Ice: im hyped for WOLVES season 2
[7:30:34] Blah206: It's a diff writer
[7:30:40] Brodih_: if you are a LOTR nerd like me, check Nerds of the Ring channel on YT, its amazing
[7:30:41] narvahh_: Its kinda weird they are making a historical figure a black woman for some reason
[7:30:43] Blah206: @Rudi_Ice Same!

[7:31:04] chuckiethegreat: another good show is the last kingdom u should check it if u havent already
[7:31:07] michaisn: I like Vikings because you can't tell it's a low budget show, from the optics it's really good
[7:31:13] KaisenSiru: thatir8Gossippopcorndino

[7:31:26] xhale2nhale: Last Kingdom is great
[7:31:36] Grunton: ozark s3 on the 21st
[7:31:37] vattuboi: its underrated show
[7:31:39] Screamnsteam: last kingdom better the vikings imo, and half the budget lmao
[7:31:40] arturiuss44: Moon Knight will be interesting not expecting much but like Oscar Issac
[7:31:46] tebbix: monkaS
[7:31:47] Rudric_Ice: did you watch WOLVES @Towelliee
[7:31:50] PhysicsX: Utred of bebbenberg

[7:32:00] Mecabeast: one of my favorite lower budget shows was Hercules on syfy channel
[7:32:03] EdgyMemeBear: Wtf, so much torghast spam monkaS
[7:32:05] michaisn: There is a Vikings sequel coming called Vikings: Valhalla
[7:32:08] Screamnsteam: Utred son of Utred EZ
[7:32:12] JackHealMe: tbh man Renown farming in thorgast is so good right now, just a good group and it's 5 minutes if not less a run
[7:32:16] Aervyper: @Towelliee i still think game pass + wow sub is just a massive potential. Add to that maybe WoW coming to Xbox all wishful thinking . I hope the blizz employwee's find some happiness in this
[7:32:16] lalelusa: I wanted to start with Archive81, but I can only watch that shit during the day/when there's lights on XD
[7:32:17] Jomuse92: I like Torghast but that would drive me insane
[7:32:22] Pikipoo: @Towelliee What is the current state of the game?
[7:32:25] SPIKEe34: Makes me appreciate just being a WF spectator :D
[7:32:27] EdgyMemeBear: I really want a 80 renown token

[7:32:57] Rizec: if they just enable the catch up till 80 its np
[7:32:58] swordart_19: You get it by passively playing, only clowsn farm it and burn out
[7:33:07] Eran_21: have you seen the venruky vid about new players experience?
[7:33:11] smokingcactus: i got my shaman fresh 60 to 80 renown in like 6 hrs it aint hard with the token but if you dont have an 80 already might take a couple days i would say
[7:33:14] EthicalHermit: I started working on getting all Cov's to 80 when 9.1.5 came out, so thankfully I am done already
[7:33:39] swordart_19: @eran_21 that dude is biased and has 0 idea he is not even guide just mad people don't pvp
[7:33:44] lalelusa: this Friday is Anduin testing, right?
[7:33:44] geros2013: I mean the way Sloot put it if its not 0% chance it wont be used I have to do it

[7:34:38] xhale2nhale: I hope they leave Jailor as a surprise for all
[7:34:46] swordart_19: @eran_21 true be guide there are new players everywhere play the game.
[7:35:02] Rizec: @xhale2nhale they confirmed that
[7:35:05] Eran_21: @swordart_19 ok dude stop
[7:35:09] SPIKEe34: I'm struggling to figure out how WF is going to work with 2 "end bosses" being released.
[7:35:10] Rizec: @xhale2nhale last 3 bosses unknown 100%
[7:35:15] theDirtyon3: @swordart_19 its ok to have bad takes my man
[7:35:35] JackHealMe: I will be so happy if they don't test the last 3 bosses I think it makes RWF much more exciting because then it's the race to see who figures it out first even before a secret phase
[7:35:37] swordart_19: @eran_21 too much logic for you?By guide and you see who is new.
[7:35:39] xhale2nhale: oh that's awesome
[7:36:09] basicknight79: when does 9.2 go live?
[7:36:10] smokingcactus: DH wont be used this tier for pushing if they smart lol
[7:36:14] tebbix: that's crazy the amount of preparation
[7:36:20] Eran_21: @swordart_19 pls man stop
[7:36:24] swordart_19: @basicknight79 Feb 22-march something
[7:36:28] smokingcactus: unless they change something
[7:36:32] Dcarter: lol wut
[7:36:34] JackHealMe: RWF prep is mental, fair play to them
[7:36:38] introvertnation: I'd say they are pretty smart, they are a RWF guild lol
[7:36:42] swordart_19: @eran_21 be sheep then.
[7:36:50] Rizec: there will be 1 dh atleast :)
[7:36:51] basicknight79: @swordart_19 thanks
[7:36:58] theDirtyon3: lol LUL sheep
[7:37:02] smokingcactus: the set bonus is terrible for single target and our survivability will be the lowest
[7:37:05] Eran_21: @swordart_19 thanks for insulting
[7:37:19] SPIKEe34: It's also important to remember that these are the top .01% of players. The average raider should play whatever they like best and will be fine.
[7:37:26] theDirtyon3: Max is already on full on prep mode
[7:37:30] Stall1: RWF is so exciting to watch
[7:37:54] macrophages: If I started playing WoW today, could I be in a top RWF guild within 2 months?
[7:37:56] sifer007: LUL
[7:37:57] tebbix: Yeah in WoW we have to deal with a lot of systems
[7:38:07] swordart_19: @macrophages yes if you are good
[7:38:21] braszky: and if you play for 24hours a day
[7:38:21] xhale2nhale: @macrophages  anything is possible
[7:38:28] jacooners: hunter or bust
[7:38:40] smokingcactus: Oh i will still be playing my VDH for my heroic mostly guild
[7:38:41] Wcvechten: anything is clearable with anything, but the top does set impressions that people like to follow
[7:38:59] SPIKEe34: For sure. Easy to say, hard to do
[7:39:11] H0bbitK1ng: most of the classes they play are only that good because the best people play them. too challenging for the average player
[7:39:26] H0bbitK1ng: healers as a prime example
[7:39:32] Jomuse92: I may be the only one that cares. I'm currently looking for what class feels right to me. The covenants skew it a bit though
[7:39:39] shriiiike: I just love how all the big streamers just hated on wow and left for catgirl anime and new world. And now they are all crawling back 😂 allways the same. If only ppl knew that streamers gets paid to play these games
[7:39:56] swordart_19: @jomuse92 you should play what you like simple as that
[7:39:57] Sacura_Shadow: deb is gonna be packed

[7:42:08] swordart_19: They got no reason you all will play LUL
[7:42:18] braszky: Can you imagine how pissed off people would have been if MS bought Actiblizz a couple years ago? Pitchforks everywhere! But not with all the shit this year they swooped in and nobody even knows if its a bad thing
[7:42:26] FireflyHI: i did not know that
[7:42:27] braszky: now*
[7:42:32] srze94: wow just doesnt need paid promotion
[7:42:32] geros2013: For wow I mean above

[7:42:34] Rizec: that makes sense tho
[7:42:35] LUKA_THIM: cos you are gonna play anyways KEKW
[7:42:36] Acidwalk: Why pay you when do it for free?
[7:42:49] SinicalDev: I think the only similar things were Preach did some cooking videos sponsored
[7:42:50] michaisn: maby because wow is too big, they don't need streamers
[7:42:55] swordart_19: You stream for free EZ
[7:42:58] noah16hallmark: i think nobbel has only ever had 1 youtube video sponsored by blizzard
[7:43:01] xxcujozxx: i have wartusk up right now @Towelliee
[7:43:03] swordart_19: Doubt about new world KEKW
[7:43:14] miztertea1: I took a hiatus from WoW back in July.  What should I be doing to catch up and be raid ready?
[7:43:21] FireflyHI: it's definitely possible
[7:43:22] SPIKEe34: They trust their PR department a bit too much maybe lol
[7:43:23] flebbooo: Mount Drops POGGERS
[7:43:24] Grunton: prime mounts
[7:43:26] Mecabeast: would lulas cooking from wow cookbook count?
[7:43:26] swordart_19: New World was paid heavily with repeated drops to hard carry section
[7:43:28] tebbix: that would be dope
[7:43:29] H0bbitK1ng: the content is far too gated to make it worth paying a non player to pick it up for 2 hours
[7:43:30] 24sevn: bobby kotcik should send you a fat check for promoting wow for so many years
[7:43:31] stryngs_: @Towelliee can you do a youtube video on all the cool shit behind you?

[7:43:51] HahnAndOnly: what
[7:43:53] Excy: Do you think things like mage tower being time locked will change? It feels like a marketing decision that could change with Microsoft

[7:44:24] xxcujozxx: cause i have it up now
[7:44:27] PrimalRain: maybe microsoft will fix wc3 reforged FeelsBadMan
[7:44:35] swordart_19: @michaisn nonsense steam is so small
[7:44:48] Aervyper: do you think 2025 that battle.net is still the launcher?
[7:44:56] SinicalDev: ESO Base PC and ESO+ both arent on gamepass
[7:45:17] xhale2nhale: it's not that they might not put money in competitve WoW, most folks just find it boring and seems to ignore Arena n MDI, but love RFW
[7:45:20] VeLocity1g: no point in putting wow on steam. dont see the need for going through 2 launchers. just get it on bnet and be done with it
[7:45:24] tebbix: I just want that 10.0 come out to start from 0 with WoW, now it is to much that I have to learn to comeback
[7:45:25] RedHeadNurse: console wow!!!???
[7:45:27] Vch001: oh god imagine battlenet coming installed with windows
[7:45:50] DaProfit: you think they will ever remove the subscription and add to game pass?
[7:45:57] Molvonos: New Windows Default background is the rolling hills image with Thrall and Anduin holding hands, skipping down the hill.
[7:46:10] swordart_19: @xhale2nhale arena and MDI are boring,great push and rwf are Pog
[7:46:11] Bobby_Bananas_: I think they will give people a free month to try WoW on gamepass, if anything
[7:46:15] SinicalDev: theyd make sweeping changes to a potential WoW2, WoWs been going for 17 years they wont change the model now
[7:46:16] jacooners: less breast milk
[7:46:20] Thoreya: big ass budget and devs
[7:46:22] SPIKEe34: @tebbix For sure! Not to mention all of the stacking systems nowadays
[7:46:30] xhale2nhale: I doubt Microsoft will  mess with Battlenet, that App is one of the best ones now
[7:46:50] swordart_19: KEKW no one would pay for FFXIV starting experience
[7:47:07] swordart_19: I did it ,it is below classic quality
[7:47:09] smokingcactus: I think the only time you should have to pay a sub is if you play the current expansion. previous expansions should be free but that is me
[7:47:11] mojusk: just have the sub be part of game pass
[7:47:17] bladdes_00: there aren't any entirely NEW players to wow.... EVERYONE played wow in some point to the past :P
[7:47:20] EdgyMemeBear: Up to level 50 would be great for trial
[7:47:20] Mecabeast: 1-50 no auction house could probably work
[7:47:21] RagingPunk: def would get allot more players :)
[7:47:24] averyv123: think they will ever bring back TCG?
[7:47:27] hSuneater: wow starting experience is shit too lol
[7:47:30] tebbix: @SPIKEe34  Exactly, I would love to comeback now,  but I would be so behind
[7:47:36] tejastres: FFXIV has 100+ hours easy of free to play. Its crazy
[7:47:37] swordart_19: You can try chars at 45 trials to test.
[7:47:40] AltChillUP_: ff14 beginning is way better than WoW
[7:47:43] Sticky_Arms: wow 2
[7:47:44] Dinosew: Does Sam Didier still work for Blizzard?
[7:47:53] Jomuse92: They could find a way to get new players to get into the game without having to deal with the compound systems. Venruki had a vid on how a new guy quit just based off of that
[7:47:55] asmo_daios: Does anyone know where i can find real info on blizzard being sold to microsoft? I really don't want to lose my account and fear of them shutting the game down
[7:47:57] swordart_19: @notunitedd you didn't played wow starting then LUL
[7:48:15] AltChillUP_: ya I mean right now
[7:48:17] death_cam_: they should make trials play up to 50 or 60 if max lvl is 70 next xpac
[7:48:27] swordart_19: @tolandverse what are you talking about even
[7:48:38] xhale2nhale: @notunitedd idk man WoW was very easy for.me but FF made me stop a few times
[7:48:41] Jomuse92: oh that's fair
[7:48:43] Caramel_Aran: Everything that the base game and Heavensward has to offer is available to a free trial player. Literally 200+ hours of content for free
[7:48:44] Eran_21: @swordart_19 bro your oponions are shouting im a wow andy and im here to shit on everyone who is not
[7:49:01] 3663Sharad: Venrukis story on the new player that just refused to do legendarys, conduits, and all thee other SL stuff was just mind blowing honest to me
[7:49:04] royster0590: last year i started wow and i just found myself confused and no idea waht was going on but i like ff its easy to get into i find. Wow has alot of history to try and catch up on
[7:49:04] mojusk: monkaS
[7:49:11] asmo_daios: @swordart_19 I started about 6 months back but heard the company sold to microsoft, tried to ask blizzard support and they told me to google the news lol
[7:49:16] SPIKEe34: I've been playing since Cata and still don't understand the Chromie time shit lol
[7:49:18] Aervyper: @Towelliee Do you see Battle.net expanding then with other microsoft games?
[7:49:18] geokouts: WoW free till 50. but no use of AH and limits on trading
[7:49:18] LunarbladeDK: at level 20 you haven't really had a taste of the game yet
[7:49:28] swordart_19: @3663sharad if you don't like game you should not play it.
[7:49:52] Wcvechten: imagine forcing new players through hellfire
[7:49:54] 3663Sharad: @swordart_19 NotLikeThis
[7:49:56] divegeeky: At this point, literally all Microsoft has to do is fire Kotik and let Blizzard be and they will make money lol.
[7:49:56] Kinghorn: arent new players forced to do BFA?
[7:49:59] asmo_daios: WoW is a great game, I hope it continues is all.
[7:50:03] Caramel_Aran: I feel Chromie time is only for experienced players. To let you do what you want while leveling.
[7:50:19] Wcvechten: ye, first time you have to do BFA
[7:50:22] AltChillUP_: @xhale2nhale  for real ? for me when I started playing was during TBC and I felt like WoW was not very beginner friendly
[7:50:23] Kinghorn: I thought you need to have leveld through BFA once to unlock chromie time
[7:50:24] futomara01: @Towelliee  you think theyll make chars 50  again  and   you  have to level to 60?
[7:50:24] KaisenSiru: PridePog

[7:50:25] mojusk: id like to see a story recap lvl mode
[7:50:25] xhale2nhale: @tolandverse why would you lose ur account, WoW not changing cause Microsoft owns
[7:50:31] Jomuse92: hell yeah
[7:50:32] king_julian_96: Towelliee do you think now Microsoft is buying blizzard wow is saved cause I think it will be
[7:50:40] Kinghorn: mentor chat swordart_19
[7:50:45] asmo_daios: ahh ok thanks @xhale2nhale i was confused by the news
[7:51:09] xhale2nhale: @notunitedd I came in with a friend but I guess as a teen it was easier for me
[7:51:11] Mecabeast: I think I got war tusks after like 50 kills or so
[7:51:12] tebbix: I don't want the same amount of cutscenes that FF have for WoW, I enjoyed the FF journey but with WoW is different
[7:51:30] Thoreya: accountwide shit needs to be added to new expansions asap now
[7:51:36] Thoreya: no more 6 months for account wide shit
[7:51:38] w1ckedclownz: LOTR Trailer is out

[7:51:44] duncon: best way to have alts leveled, have you teenage son start some characters on your account :D
[7:51:45] asmo_daios: I quit 7 years of ffxiv and have been enjoying wow.
[7:51:50] SPIKEe34: I think 10.0 is when we will see the  real state of wow, if they listen to tester feedbac, etc.
[7:51:51] futomara01: swtor?
[7:52:04] tebbix: KEKW yep
[7:52:06] AltChillUP_: Ff14 is a RPG before a MMO
[7:52:07] asmo_daios: ffxiv is pure story lmao all cutscenes
[7:52:08] Kinghorn: 100%
[7:52:08] swordart_19: Does not liar
[7:52:09] LUKA_THIM: but its all anime trash
[7:52:16] Grunton: i hate the 1 hour ones at the end of expantions
[7:52:22] braszky: FF14 has too many turn and nod cutscene holy shit lol
[7:52:24] happybooger: what about swotr?
[7:52:24] vulkankragon: majority of the cutscenes in ffxiv are useless
[7:52:33] asmo_daios: true
[7:52:39] Naturalbeef: That makes FF so obnoxious
[7:52:45] Eran_21: and also you literally cant skip some of them
[7:52:49] Mecabeast: I dislike mid raid cutscenes cause guildies always had us skip
[7:52:50] MetaChar: swtor maybe
[7:52:51] Kinghorn: coxNod
[7:53:00] Thoreya: just give me a good gameplay/combat mmo please. ill stick to wow. idc about mmo story
[7:53:01] VeLocity1g: swtor cut scenes are not that long
[7:53:12] king_julian_96: I’m currently up to 4.1 in stormblood and I’m must say so far I have enjoyed the story of ffxiv
[7:53:14] tebbix: yes 2 different games and both great, simple
[7:53:19] Kinghorn: swtor has the most voiced lines for sure, dunno about most cutscenes
[7:53:26] AltChillUP_: @metachar SWTOR is a nice balance in my opinion
[7:53:29] asmo_daios: I got bored with newworld after around 100 hours lol
[7:53:30] Human_Variant: you can always skip the cut scenes and dialog in ff14
[7:53:48] Mecabeast: kinda like how mynameisbyf does lore videos for destiny
[7:53:51] CodyKane: Yah New world has a shit ton of lore, its actually kinda surprising
[7:54:03] Eran_21: @JonMcMillan no bro you cant always do that
[7:54:07] futomara01: 50/50
[7:54:07] stryngs_: i read two wow books that were very good they cinematics kinda pay fan service to them as well
[7:54:08] geros2013: I mean 100hours for a non sub game is value for money though @TolandVerse
[7:54:12] asmo_daios: wow is just massive, i got bored with my main and have found it enjoyable lvling new classes and races
[7:54:22] SPIKEe34: After playing WoW, I find myself always trying to change UI, etc to mimick my WoW UI
[7:54:26] divegeeky: New World had so much potential.....I wish its endgame was better.
[7:54:27] tebbix: is very subjective yeah
[7:54:30] SPIKEe34: in other gagmes

[7:56:04] divegeeky: Honestly not having to make multiple characters may be why New World was so boring without an end-game.

[8:26:22] Rudric_Ice: he didnt even kill he just injured someone
[8:26:32] theDirtyon3: i gotta agree with someone in chat illidan's eye beam to kill Xera was the best
[8:26:35] Felrane: He hasn't killed anyone yet
[8:26:36] rensdeamo: Men have 20,000 words in them per day - Women have 50,000 - do you have any left for the misses ;)

[8:26:42] Scoodles91: he's going to cry, for sure :D
[8:26:47] Eran_21: maybe no one does?
[8:26:56] KingsandClubs: Varian appearence wouls be amazing
[8:27:08] Felrane: Varian is disenchanted
[8:27:09] Dinosew: It will be Gamon
[8:27:10] dyslexican1: But guards arnt people... if they were. we are all multi million time murderers!
[8:27:17] onybear: Flesh wounds

[8:27:46] Mellohype: but like, WoW on gamepass?
[8:27:53] Maydie6066: but the big question @Towelliee is does he get keep the sweet loot he got from the Jailer?
[8:27:54] KingsandClubs: One flew over the cucko’s nest Anduin LUL
[8:27:58] kyr_slowbro: Probably has some soul damage is how I'd spin it
[8:27:59] seslok: whats your opinion on the acquisition?
[8:28:11] sweetiepiles: loot council bor
[8:28:13] sweetiepiles: bro
[8:28:31] arlog111: probably that sword went to a hunter
[8:28:32] kyr_slowbro: Jailor is RL and get's all the loot
[8:28:35] Dinosew: Clippy will snap him out of it
[8:28:42] N3llee: Maybe once we kill the Jailor the corruption fades from the sword
[8:28:51] Bayne77: shamalamadingdong is fucked up now
[8:28:53] Maydie6066: WoW 11.0: Anduin wtf did you do to my sword - Varian
[8:28:55] CullenPrime: He probably wouldn't want any of it because it would remind him of the evil he did
[8:29:01] KingsandClubs: He doesn’t deserve that sword to be honest
[8:29:07] Siddyy: i can hear asmon saying "yo canni get that"
[8:29:10] Nokterian: Magni will be appearing in Microsoftt Word "Champion do ya need any help?"
[8:29:16] spainard15: Valen, Greymane and that Black Dragonfight guys has been teaching Anduin for years
[8:29:19] reaprwolf: yea it went to a hunter
[8:29:30] Vuruca: Wait there video of after anduin fight
[8:29:34] Yzuthoth: Turyalon will be the new king
[8:29:35] Jahknowme: you ready for the love rocket grind again?
[8:29:35] Moobot: Towelliee booted up his YouTube channel again! Check out the latest YouTube video HERE || Towelliee Reacts to 10.0 Leaks!! youtu.be/RMF7zwsjYGU
[8:29:37] KingsandClubs: He won’t be the king anymore for sure
[8:29:43] flebbooo: oh no for sure, its gonna be Turalyon from now on
[8:29:45] Eran_21: that would be weird
[8:29:46] abracka_: WotLK 2.0: Wrath of Anduin
[8:29:49] OathXP: Turalyon bout to lead an inquisition I'm calling it
[8:29:52] reinhardtdog: Turalyon is the King now!
[8:29:52] unholyagony: Anduin gonna have to kill that old fooka
[8:29:55] SmuttBudgie: hell go do a thrall and go off and sulk for a bit
[8:29:57] Celestia6: I can see Turalyon going all light crazy
[8:30:04] KingsandClubs: Turalyon is much of an egoistic character to give him the throne back
[8:30:18] SpoofAvatar: sit against a wall like Baine for the xpac
[8:30:21] EdgyMemeBear: Go on a journey to find himself again FeelsGoodMan
[8:30:23] valianya: Thats in one of the leaks
[8:30:30] KingsandClubs: Turalyon exiles anduin and the boy tries to find his manhood
[8:30:33] balancedlight: I dont think next expansion will have anything to do with the Dragon Isles. I think the next one will be a complete Light invasion to cleanse the desecration of death magic from azeroth. Anduin will be a good segway to understanding that there is no real difference between the light domination and what the jailer did to him.
[8:30:38] Yzuthoth: We know he's void-touched from the Before the Storm book... maybe they'll do something with that
[8:30:44] bantuatha: @Towelliee What's left for 10.0? there is almost entirely no left to discover new lands on Azrorth
[8:30:48] callmestray: 100% mount this time
[8:30:53] bantuatha: the only hope left is dragon isle
[8:31:00] N3llee: thank you btw for the gifted sub team. mighty nice of you.
[8:31:00] im_n0t_jezus: a few from alliance and hord will split and create 3rd bih faction
[8:31:01] arcaniia007: yes u can
[8:31:11] EdgyMemeBear: You can stack it
[8:31:11] death_cam_: there is the undermine aswell as the other side of azeroth
[8:31:16] CushyPop: Turalyon is unfit for trying to off Illidan
[8:31:19] jasperboy: im here, it drops now
[8:31:19] HaloS23: @Towelliee I think its going to switch focus to Thrall and Baine / Horde side focus for 10.0. Been a couple expacs of Alliance focus so now Hordes turn
[8:31:23] jasperboy: shit
[8:31:31] Fruity_Pebbles2018: how powerful is Turalyon?
[8:31:36] Wildsuit_: jinxed it
[8:31:38] cryft: @HaloS23 uh sylvanas hello
[8:31:49] HaloS23: good point
[8:32:14] Ziddrax: new race : azeroth children
[8:32:19] Ziddrax: or faction
[8:32:20] unholyagony: i really hope they bring the factions together. being appart is pointless now
[8:32:20] HaloS23: @cryft fair point. kinda forgot bout her
[8:32:22] Wildsuit_: i prefer the alliance vs horde hatred
[8:32:23] N3llee: Its kinda about time. The last few xpacs have been about uniting both forces to overcome the evil.
[8:32:26] Maydie6066: Alliance horde combined story i fear means more BS with Thrall and Jaina, both who have been super powerful but are now super cucks
[8:32:27] Kittastrophe: for sure
[8:32:27] shattermeister: bro Illidan 1h blocked him mid reeeee
[8:32:29] flebbooo: I mean Illdian just grabbed his sword with his bare hands KEKW
[8:32:30] abracka_: illidan just stopped turalyons sword mid swing
[8:32:35] randomgeneratedchad: Tirion was a GIGACHAD
[8:32:35] abracka_: bare handed
[8:32:39] reinhardtdog: We forget Turalyon has been at war for YEARS
[8:32:39] randomgeneratedchad: you dont fuck with tiron
[8:32:41] Noiseeater: void lords next
[8:32:45] KingsandClubs: I mean the jackpot is a light vs void expansion and mid patch dragon isles are introduces what ya think towlz @towelliee
[8:32:55] dyslexican1: Thats cus Illidan is a chad.
[8:32:55] Kittastrophe: to be fair it's illidan
[8:32:58] theDirtyon3: Illidan made Turaliyan his bitch
[8:33:17] Mecabeast: he scares me into thinking what happened on alt draenor during the maghar allied race story will happen on azeroth
[8:33:21] Ziddrax: 10 k
[8:33:22] SinicalDev: I guess factioned MMOs outside of PvP and maybe economy are dead
[8:33:22] Archiee: he was in the hyperbolic time chamber
[8:33:23] valianya: Time dilation 10000 years
[8:33:25] balancedlight: Uhhh Illidan is one of the strongest beings in the universe... lol
[8:33:32] im_n0t_jezus: yeah he know how to gfight
[8:33:38] shattermeister: Illidan chosen one tho. but ya thousands of years across the cosmos slaying demons
[8:33:38] KingsandClubs: I mean the jackpot is a light vs void expansion and mid patch dragon isles are introduces what ya think towlz? @towelliee
[8:33:46] NickLeonhearth: 10 000 years fight, and that bastard still couldn't win, more like 10k years hiding
[8:33:48] Wildsuit_: 10k years and you come to face me..."YOU ARE NOT PREPARED"
[8:33:54] abracka_: illidan just turned around and nuked a naaru in one eye beam
[8:33:59] Will_est: Will_est subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! SHEEEEESH
[8:34:01] abracka_: after turaylon
[8:34:01] Felrane: Seems the Jailer might not be killable
[8:34:02] balancedlight: he is offbrand jesus
[8:34:13] CptFruitBear: Towlie is that the TFV18 tank?
[8:34:32] Felrane: Illidan/Malfurion the most powerful mortals on Azeroth since Azshara left
[8:34:36] Bayne77: Illidan is one of the two strongest beings with the last name of Stormrage
[8:34:43] MasterZzzzZzzz: I mean Illidan is just as gold tho being an elf that survived the sunndering so does it really matter how long Turaylon was fighting demons when Illidan was doing the same sorta?
[8:35:01] xarivh: we use his own power against him i guess
[8:35:05] Wcvechten: just use a gun and shoot him
[8:35:05] KingsandClubs: Turalyon is like og uther strenght
[8:35:08] Molvonos: Jailer Prototype is his death animation.  He naruto-logged the players and ran away like a bitch, you heard it here first.
[8:35:10] Rudric_Ice: Malfurion is stronger than illidan
[8:35:13] shattermeister: imo 8f the arbiter got popped he's on the list
[8:35:18] shattermeister: if
[8:35:26] balancedlight: Malfurion used to be legit he fell the f off like 10 years ago
[8:35:29] Ziddrax: oh that would be cool tho
[8:35:31] skoll135: heh no
[8:35:32] Felrane: He infects Azeroth?
[8:35:40] Wildsuit_: i bet Jailer gets sealed away like how The Master did @Towelliee
[8:35:40] Dinermoe: wait what
[8:35:45] Felrane: that could be cool
[8:35:50] Ziddrax: what if he's soul  wakes azeroth?
[8:36:00] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @KingsandClubs (warning)
[8:36:15] reinhardtdog: Well... if he becomes Azeroth then I guess we are going back in time...  how else would we deal with that?
[8:36:18] balancedlight: when is the last time Malfurion did ANYTHING worth a damn
[8:36:18] blascotwitch: !leaks

[8:36:49] N3llee: hmm.. in theory that could fit with the leaks about Azeroth being like the mind of a child. What if his essence attempt to corrupt the world soul but the world spits out Azeroth baby prematurely.
[8:36:55] Wildsuit_: im just suprised Azeroth didnt wake up when you had a sword plunged in your butt @Towelliee
[8:36:56] KingsandClubs: Let’s not forget that there is a huge fucking sword plundered into azeroth
[8:37:06] Felrane: haha
[8:37:08] unholyagony: xD
[8:37:12] KingsandClubs: @wildsuit_ exactly
[8:37:14] Venkxx: we might even have to heal the woons again :D
[8:37:20] Wildsuit_: right
[8:37:25] H0bbitK1ng: theyve been building to the battle with the void the whole time
[8:37:29] H0bbitK1ng: its probably that
[8:37:36] JediNeo99999: Is emerald dream still a thing after the raid? I don't know much lore
[8:37:42] balancedlight: Read my previous theory pleas i just posted it in your chat a minute ago. I just wanna know what you think
[8:37:50] reinhardtdog: @JediNeo99999 Yeah it still is
[8:37:53] KingsandClubs: I want a light vs void exp with an implementition of dragon isles mid patch
[8:37:53] ninedraft317: He takes over the earth soul and khadgar teleport us to a new planet
[8:37:58] Rudric_Ice: lets bring back Li shen he was a cool guy
[8:38:04] Rudric_Ice: lei*
[8:38:11] ninedraft317: Where there are dragons
[8:38:19] nozcystic: who takes over the amw then?
[8:38:24] nozcystic: maw
[8:38:37] NinjaGlovz: towOof
[8:38:38] Exodeo_: lets just pretend the maw never existed :p
[8:38:38] Felrane: The Maw was just the Tower before the Jailer was put there
[8:39:08] balancedlight: I dont think next expansion will have anything to do with the Dragon Isles. I think the next one will be a complete Light invasion to cleanse the desecration of death magic from azeroth. Anduin will be a good segway to understanding that there is no real difference between the light domination and what the jailer did to him.
[8:39:08] Rudric_Ice: why tho ?
[8:39:12] lalelusa: the maw was a chaotic wasteland. Immortan Joe would've loved it
[8:39:16] KingsandClubs: Can we send bobby in the maw?
[8:39:24] randomgeneratedchad: new stormwind on a new planet @Towelliee  WoW 2.0
[8:39:38] balancedlight: yes
[8:39:40] Felrane: I could see the Light being the ones behind the Domination magic
[8:39:41] Celestia6: I agree that is likely to happen
[8:39:43] lawles_walrus: Is there a scenerio where he tries to corrupt azeroth but azeroth then corrupts him instead and we find out that azeroth is actually evil and deathwing was actually trying to save us from the corruption
[8:39:49] lawles_walrus: i dunno that sounds dumb now honestly
[8:39:50] lalelusa: in the next one, we won't go up to the Dragon Isles, but down to Azeroth's core
[8:39:52] SpoofAvatar: Purged by the light
[8:40:00] vHectiKv: we need the Scarlet Crusade to come back and hunt down Sylvanas

[8:40:18] Felrane: Poor planet needs a break. Last one lasted 10,000 years atleast
[8:40:18] balancedlight: Thats why they put the light invasion in Revendreth.
[8:40:26] cryft: like a cataclysm PogChamp
[8:40:28] Wildsuit_: @Towelliee i had thought we were going to go more down the Void path because if i remeber right Blizzard said that the Alliance's leadership is going to go a bit dark
[8:40:41] Rudric_Ice: 21 savage better
[8:40:45] RageerPLZ: I believe in Draenor continued story that the light takes over and the dranei chick kills Hellscream.
[8:40:46] SpoofAvatar: call the Eternals and put her back to sleep
[8:40:47] Blackhaxx: aslong as shes not a karen

[8:41:35] Felrane: I liked the leak about using the Emerald dream to overlay the physical realm to repair Azeroth
[8:41:38] inj0shwetrust: cause she has the iq of Gilbert Grape
[8:41:43] Wildside1177: @NoSelfJustice lol
[8:41:44] Todmeister9000: is Magni involved?
[8:41:45] Lorunex: I just hope the next expansion has lots of dragons, and a followup to the Algalon like beings :D
[8:41:57] JohnLeMay: Afternoon, yall

[8:42:14] vtech310: Or as Scarlett Johannsen as Lucy
[8:42:15] JLmorten: Wakes up and dies of Covid19
[8:42:20] balancedlight: Imagine returning to Azeroth and All of Kalimdor has been completely taken by the armies of light.
[8:42:27] Wildsuit_: oh god are they gonna bring back Azerite @Towelliee
[8:42:28] FergusCreative: if she wakes up though doesnt our world get destroyed? Look at Argus place is fucked
[8:42:36] inj0shwetrust: Ill take Reaping Flames back though ngl
[8:42:36] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallen renown 0 and how far behind? depends on what you want to do. Compete? pretty behind.  Casual play? just play the game
[8:42:44] dyslexican1: If Azeroth wakes up as Cortana? Does that mean Master chief comes in to help us save her? Is that the Halo cross over we all didn't know we wanted?
[8:42:45] PieceOfPanic: Haven't you seen eternals? DON'T WAKE IT UP LUL
[8:42:45] CullenPrime: According to that latest leak she will be waking up.Not that it's true
[8:42:46] KingsandClubs: I swear at the end it’s gonna be like something so random like battle for galaxy expansion LUL
[8:42:57] Ziddrax: i still believe they gonna make azeroth wake up like a celestial from the eternals
[8:43:00] Blackhaxx: about time

[8:44:01] shmasherd: I wouldnt mind if Azeroth woke up and was super pissed. WTF have you all been doing to me while I was sleeping. Goes apeshit
[8:44:06] Felrane: @FergusCreative The planet should be fine even if she wakes up. Argus was pilliaged by the Legion. When he woke up and we fought him the planet was fine in the background still.
[8:44:07] Todmeister9000: he's dead, I killed him with my necklace beam
[8:44:09] Rudric_Ice: can malfurion be badass for one expansion pls
[8:44:10] DannyG757: Nzoth was cool
[8:44:10] vanillahobbit: old gods dont die interviews hint at that too
[8:44:11] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallen the doesnt take that long. A couple of weeks and you're cought up. Also depend on how much time you have. Everything is relative, there is no correct answer

[8:45:21] onybear: This is all a dream and the child-boy aduin wakes up….and it starts all over again
[8:45:23] aimassistallen: @sidecarshrimp Can I ask you one more question. Would you go Dh or warrior for melee?
[8:45:25] digitoxity: sylvannas never burned the tree it was nztoth
[8:45:27] TheGaoSora: We killed his older brothers, that little twerp is no different please just accept this LUL
[8:45:31] CptFruitBear: The matrix Isles lol
[8:45:32] Felrane: Id like N'zoth to become our friend against the Void lords.
[8:45:35] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallen took me 2 weeks of casual play after i have not beem playing for a year to get to 230ish
[8:45:39] Mellohype: The opening cinematic fades from a black screen, you are in the back of a wagon in the forest...

[8:45:50] sifoo01: Daddy Microsoft will fix everything
[8:45:52] HaxzorJimDuggan: wasn't the first fight against wrathion a complete illusion no reason why the last fight or all the fights were the same
[8:46:01] PenguMancer: we wake up in a chamber all of warcraft was not real and we segway into World of Starcraft
[8:46:03] havenbirch: Hey you... finally awake?
[8:46:03] balancedlight: Ya Sargeras's return would be most excellent as well. there is no closure there either.
[8:46:05] OhNoNotAgain: Long as the Guy from Antman gets to tell us what happened while we were gone.
[8:46:06] vanillahobbit: sageras gonna help out not nzoth :D
[8:46:11] lalelusa: 1 fish, 2 fish, red pill, blue pill
[8:46:16] Rudric_Ice: isn't the undead ravaging the whole azeroth currently
[8:46:17] Yzuthoth: Old gods don't align with anyone ever
[8:46:18] dyslexican1: I can't wait till the real bad guy Sargaras comes back. Cus he aint dead.
[8:46:20] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallen well, you have to decide for your own. What do you like the most? they are pretty different from each other
[8:46:22] tebbix: monkaS
[8:46:23] TheGaoSora: danCopium
[8:46:30] zerkx1: inb4 all of your adventures in WoW thus far have been a Dream. Woooo
[8:46:33] kyr_slowbro: I bet it's in the book
[8:46:35] RageerPLZ: I am okay with that bring back corruption
[8:46:41] aimassistallen: @sidecarshrimp I like melee dps.
[8:46:42] Molvonos: Yooooo.  Cutscene to N'zoth waking us up, but instead, it's in a cart leading us to our execution before a dragon attacks.
[8:46:44] RageerPLZ: or a form of it
[8:46:47] TheGaoSora: WORLD OF ALLCRAFT!
[8:46:54] balancedlight: Also what about the Final Voidlord we freed from the shadow priest weapon.
[8:46:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: Phil is going to fix it!
[8:47:02] Molvonos: World of Skyrim.
[8:47:02] Felrane: N'zoth could pull starcraft overmind move. Free himself from the old gods and go to war against them!
[8:47:03] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallen both are good for m+
[8:47:06] NoSelfJustice: do you reckon they will try and make out, Sylv was under the Jailer's influence for all the "bad" she did? to try and compensate here not dying?
[8:47:07] tebbix: I have never played starcraft but the cinematics are sick af
[8:47:09] gibby23: The “it was just a dream” better not be their way out. That’s SO weak

[8:47:35] ThaOriginalGamester: The azshara raid
[8:47:43] unholyagony: N'zoth could of
[8:47:44] ThaOriginalGamester: when they released him
[8:47:46] jacooners: in our sleep
[8:47:51] Silverwards: when Sargeras stabbed the planet
[8:47:53] im_n0t_jezus: ICC
[8:47:54] Silverwards: we go boom
[8:47:56] Felrane: When Nyalotha realm was destroy we were deposited on the Dragon Islands
[8:47:58] vonswarley: ICC
[8:48:02] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallenbut you should play whatever you find fun, not decide what others say or think is good
[8:48:11] balancedlight: how about when we all officially died during the Argus fight
[8:48:14] lawles_walrus: we tech died in ICC
[8:48:18] SidecarShrimp: @aimassistallen for example, i play enh shaman because i like it
[8:48:21] Wcvechten: I mean, N'zoth's eyes themselves shot the laser beams in the Azshara fight, no reason not to think his body is still there instead of Ny'alotha
[8:48:23] vtech310: Maybe wow is like the matrix. our chars are hooked up like nzoth batteries in dragon isles and we are in the matrix of the shadowlands/azeroth
[8:48:23] yoloswaglols: we wake up and have to start over with vanilla again
[8:48:27] bumpstock75: Should we be dead just to be in the SL
[8:48:29] TheGaoSora: It was actually SE that bought ActiBlizz PowerUpL danEvil PowerUpR
[8:48:30] Silverwards: did we though?
[8:48:31] Zip13: Azshara raid as an achievement where the last person alive needs to get a buff and kill her with it
[8:48:32] ninedraft317: When he gave us his gift
[8:48:34] lawles_walrus: did we though
[8:48:36] balancedlight: according to nzoth we did
[8:48:37] Scoodles91: but did we >?
[8:48:38] FergusCreative: It was all a dream, used to read barrens chat up in the limousine
[8:48:40] AlphasaurusRexx: when we died fighting the pelicans in barrens back in tbc
[8:48:44] potnudel: but did we
[8:48:45] lalelusa: I died during those 3 hours questline for the cloak
[8:48:48] Rudric_Ice: i just  want tentacle mommy to come back Kreygasm Squid2 Squid4
[8:48:48] Ziddrax: and what we killed was a fake
[8:48:52] NoSelfJustice: Harry Potter gives us his resurrection stone
[8:48:53] Blackhaxx: we must go deeper into the matrix
[8:48:55] Felrane: We just want Shadowlands retconned so lets make it happen!
[8:48:56] ThaOriginalGamester: @AlphasaurusRexx 😭
[8:48:58] havenbirch: All the Old Gods are alive, we only killed their avatars
[8:49:02] Kisswani: why not all the old gods are alive ? D:
[8:49:06] Katrikan: @Towelliee maybe his essence got infused into the blade nefarian stabbed him with?
[8:49:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are always meta choices, but many of those are just a fraction of a percent better....yeah, play what you like...they try to balance it all
[8:49:10] unholyagony: his tentacles are inside our titan world soul. inside her
[8:49:10] AndrewShifuVA: an extension into the titans world would be cool
[8:49:11] KingsandClubs: Nzoth and the chamber of secrets LUL
[8:49:16] gibby23: Hanging out with biggie and Tupac
[8:49:18] balancedlight: How many Voidlords are officially still alive?
[8:49:18] dyslexican1: Thatsa good point @havenbirch
[8:49:22] Wcvechten: I mean, N'zoth also traded Xal'ataht's freedom for the Dagger she was in, and we know it contain an old god. Remember Wrathioon stabbed him with the dagger, so maybe he's chilling inside the dagger @Towelliee
[8:49:28] Schloshed: What is dead may never die
[8:49:33] PatchesMcPatch: is cthun alive or dead?
[8:49:37] bioreducto: If nzoth is alive does that mean we are getting corruption back sometime in the future
[8:49:54] SidecarShrimp: @bioreducto oh god plz no
[8:49:59] jacooners: lich king and illdan fuse together
[8:49:59] Rudric_Ice: so y'shaarj stll alive
[8:49:59] lalelusa: N'zoth is around while Xalatath is still around
[8:50:03] vanillahobbit: @patchesmcpatch alive only ysaharsh is ded if we go by interviews etc
[8:50:04] KingsandClubs: I mean the old gods can manifest themselves as the light aswell right?
[8:50:09] Theduskflyer: @towelliee a little off topic, how many cartel coins you have on SWTOR? Still over 100k lol
[8:50:10] Felrane: @Wcvechten I like the idea that like Titans they can soul split. So he put part of himself in the Dagger just incase. Then tried to take over Azeroth which failed
[8:50:33] havenbirch: I mean if we get an Emerald Dream / Dragon isles expac, it'd be perfect to encounter N'zoth and other Old Gods in the Dream
[8:51:04] lalelusa: the keepers were also able to create a new "old" god: G'huun. so there's always a chance
[8:51:16] TheGaoSora: Does this mean that G'huun is still alive? D:
[8:51:20] valianya: @towelliee  what if when we kill the Jailor, the 'dead' Old Gods we 'killed' escape from the Maw and return to Azeroth
[8:51:43] ninedraft317: It when he we got n’zoths gift that’s when it became a dream/death
[8:51:44] Drenakys: It was all just a dream, caused by Nzoth? I would love to see that all those SL systems were just a dream.
[8:51:45] kyr_slowbro: Gotta destroy world to eradicate old gods?
[8:51:47] havenbirch: Maybe theres a 5th Old God, or an Ultimate Old God
[8:51:48] Molvonos: You mean like the Reorigination Beam that killed N'Zoth??
[8:51:56] Kisswani: yo , what if Algalon comes back to help after the Jailer does some shit ? D;
[8:52:00] Molvonos: Just sayin
[8:52:05] vanillahobbit: ye the others can only be killed in their plane at least if we look on hints/interviews other cosmic entities
[8:52:05] TheGaoSora: @valianya old gods don't go to the maw
[8:52:06] Theduskflyer: Agalon 2.0!?!
[8:52:14] Rudric_Ice: yogg was the best old god he was  a lunatic
[8:52:17] xFevers: Imagine looking at past Lore with where the game is today
[8:52:18] kyr_slowbro: I WAS HERE
[8:52:21] Silverwards: Y'Shaarj still fucked us up, even dead
[8:52:33] lawles_walrus: but she's super hot

[8:52:50] Kisswani: that would be great
[8:52:50] Molvonos: @lawles_walrus brizziHmm
[8:52:55] lalelusa: Like void dragons?
[8:52:57] TheGaoSora: Just sitting there playing poker KEKW
[8:52:58] Wcvechten: just chilling, drinking some tea, talk about the time they spent sealed away, a family reunion
[8:53:04] Arcmourn: dragon isles = old content rework maybe?
[8:53:11] Felrane: Their bodies are rotting and creating problems like the Sha.
[8:53:12] balancedlight: Cthun can make a return
[8:53:14] Kisswani: first tier end boss : the Old God Pantheon
[8:53:21] MeisterPetze: want to fight against ragi again
[8:53:21] bioreducto: A raid where you face all the old gods
[8:53:22] Maego1: they are chillin in the corridor
[8:53:45] vudhu89: Hey Towelliee, how you doing man ?
[8:53:51] Felrane: N'zoth chilling in the Dagger
[8:53:56] FergusCreative: They all join together to from an old god megazord
[8:54:04] Kisswani: danHmm
[8:54:04] pilltillkill: Is such a thing even possible? Yes. Yes it is
[8:54:09] balancedlight: Dont the old gods have the ability to ressurect themselves in the voidworld?
[8:54:10] havenbirch: N'zoth the Arbiter xD
[8:54:16] arlog111: well didn't a lot of players decide to keep nzoths gift on their heads?
[8:54:18] balancedlight: kind of like the burning legion
[8:54:19] Jarlan23: its possible. anything is possible as long as the writers want it to be

[8:54:35] vudhu89: Its all just a dream
[8:54:36] Drenakys: He could slip into the ED, so yes… he could.
[8:54:38] Kisswani: kinda like what the devourers are doing ?
[8:54:38] MeisterPetze: shadowlands is a dream of nzoth
[8:54:49] Rudric_Ice: in WoW nobody dies permanently
[8:54:49] h00rayforstuff: Nzoth gonna use the forge to bring back Sogg and the boys
[8:54:53] Molvonos: Old God deathzone is likely far and removed from the Shadowlands, kinda like most demonic/Burning Crusade mobs.
[8:54:55] balancedlight: ya they ressurect in the void
[8:55:00] vudhu89: Void lands
[8:55:01] smokingcactus: damn i have her up but on HORDE

[8:55:13] Kisswani: KEKW
[8:55:14] vanillahobbit: id love that
[8:55:14] Felrane: N'zoth was in the realm of life so him infecting Death/Arcane/Fel/Light could happen
[8:55:16] vudhu89: haha can you imagine KEK
[8:55:17] lalelusa: old gods don't have souls, I think
[8:55:21] vudhu89: Pure outrage lol
[8:55:23] MeisterPetze: we are all corrupted of nzoth and the shadowlands is just a bad dream
[8:55:25] Molvonos: World of Warcraft: DAHKness

[8:55:27] jinghol2: wow the void no land
[8:55:29] Freddye: id be so disapoint
[8:55:31] Bazsidiver: lots of tenticles
[8:55:33] JQ47: void lands more like aVOID this expac!
[8:55:36] Girm87: has this expansion not been a big void?
[8:55:38] KingsandClubs: Old god Heaven called Elwyn fforrest
[8:55:42] spainard15: They go to the Void or Twisting Nether?
[8:55:44] griffdog125: Void Lands beyound Thunderdome
[8:55:45] lalelusa: World of Warcraft: into the Void
[8:55:46] Arcmourn: dragon isles (BFA) Voidlands (shadowlands)
[8:55:47] H0bbitK1ng: i mean its almost certainly a void centric expac
[8:55:53] h00rayforstuff: void is legit the coolest big bad of wow
[8:56:01] unholyagony: she becomes preggo
[8:56:06] vimie: they will prob use Arthas somehow to bridge to the new xpack
[8:56:07] Freddye: Corrupted stuff ResidentSleeper

[8:56:13] balancedlight: World of Warcraft: Lights Void!!!!
[8:56:13] dyslexican1: Has anyone else noticed ther eis zero mention of Valerein in this Xpac? So, is he not dead? Cus I think he isnt actually dead
[8:56:14] MeisterPetze: firelands !
[8:56:20] FergusCreative: Phil spencer announces it, "Look guys I know it sucks but we had nothing to do it. It was all Bobbys idea"
[8:56:21] Theduskflyer: Did we get allied races this xpac??
[8:56:21] vudhu89: Nzoth did say, only he can save us from whats to come
[8:56:24] H0bbitK1ng: theyve been building for a light vs void the whole time
[8:56:26] timmythegamertv: exactly..
[8:56:26] ThumbzPro: Enjoying all this theory crafting. 😅
[8:56:27] tebbix: I wonder what would happen, right now Turalyon is chilling in the throne of Stormwind
[8:56:28] Drenakys: I can see a Yrel coming back for sure.
[8:56:28] Rudric_Ice: lets bring back the FEL
[8:56:36] bluevexlo: Titans are the hidden villains imo
[8:56:39] Wcvechten: They did update the Ethereals for new models, And they haven't really used them for alot yet, so 🤔
[8:56:43] Felrane: Azeroth is likely corrupted by all forces. We saw here being corrupted by Fel and Void in Legion when we fought her Nightmares
[8:56:43] GivTater: we theory crafting again?
[8:57:02] Blackhaxx: Nzoth=Phil Spencer ?
[8:57:04] h00rayforstuff: sure we do. listen to the Thousand Years of War short story and Alleria's experience with the void

[8:57:15] 3663Sharad: CrreamAwk
[8:57:15] lalelusa: he wasn't corrupted by the void, though. He got mad from experiencing all those souls' lives and decided life was broken due to all the shit happening
[8:57:15] vudhu89: Mine too lol, he tested us, told us he can save us .. we nuked him kek
[8:57:17] Arcmourn: LUL

[8:57:25] ShaunsterTheMonster: For Microsoft!
[8:57:26] Motraxtv: Still hope for a light expansion. Turalyon invited the light and the naaru KEKW
[8:57:27] vudhu89: lol
[8:57:28] havenbirch: Maybe N'zoth used the 'vision' to train us, with Shadowlands as the training ground
[8:57:30] sgtsreym: ok i got chills
[8:57:31] kyr_slowbro: AngelThump
[8:57:34] aleck1776: Finally the Anduin we always wanted.

[8:57:43] Molvonos: towNot
[8:57:44] PenguMancer: Just give me Night ELF mowhawk Class already!!
[8:57:51] Felrane: Thats why I like the Idea of N'zoth using the Dagger to free himself from the Void Lords like Xal'atath. Making him litterally the only one that can save us from the Void Lords
[8:57:52] smashwow: i'm telling ya. it's all a fever dream
[8:57:53] Drenakys: Shadow Priest Anduin
[8:57:54] FireEmblemLord: EMBRACE THE VOID
[8:57:54] SidecarShrimp: ålz @Towelliee be the new voice actor for anduin
[8:57:56] Templexx: we need a new unburned tree lmao
[8:58:02] MeisterPetze: nzoth IS the jailor
[8:58:03] GivTater: Shadowlands is our hyperbolic time chamber?
[8:58:05] unholyagony: hes the lesser of the 2 evils to come
[8:58:08] Bayne77: N'Zoth Knows!
[8:58:08] xo_navi: Planned since WC3
[8:58:09] Freddye: !leaks

[8:58:14] dan_monk: Maybe N'zoth knew about a future Microsoft acquisition and ran!
[8:58:15] h00rayforstuff: that's just the Lich King plot lol
[8:58:18] wanderlust81: @towelliee i thought there was a theory that actually the light is the evil force
[8:58:18] KingsandClubs: I forgot who stayed in azeroth from major character aside from turalyon
[8:58:25] vudhu89: Yeah, think about it.. He trained us because if death gets out and the universe gets reoriginated, they would potentially cease to exist.
[8:58:27] Tia214: i mean oden did  he had us fight him
[8:58:29] Felrane: He did test us all of BFA
[8:58:33] dyslexican1: But why would N'Zoth save us from the void lords?
[8:58:34] valianya: Maybe the true danger is Xalatath
[8:58:34] Wildsuit_: n zoth turned good guy good god no
[8:58:36] Rudric_Ice: Then xal'atath marries anduin and have void babies
[8:58:37] MeisterPetze: PRANGD YA
[8:58:42] Molvonos: Bitches always be testing us.  Lich King tested us and got stomped.
[8:58:44] SicDogg: @Towelliee will u be playing lostark ?
[8:58:44] spainard15: He knows the DreadLords are coming
[8:58:48] spainard15: or Void lords
[8:58:50] Bayne77: yeah we got Odyn'ed by N'Zoth
[8:58:51] Wildsuit_: more chances of Deathwing turning good if he was still alive
[8:58:51] timmythegamertv: I'm waiting for the N'Zoth redemption arc! LUL
[8:58:59] FreeguyDH: We have been in the WoW matrix the entire xpac
[8:59:07] smashwow: you really think we beat n'zoth that easily?
[8:59:08] Templexx: man i just wana help out at the farms and do simple stuff haha
[8:59:08] tebbix: Pog
[8:59:16] Wcvechten: Locus-walker did say the void only tells Half Truth, so they're like 50/50
[8:59:18] unholyagony: well he can see into the future. he might see we are inevitable to win
[8:59:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lost Ark is just weeks away!
[8:59:18] KingsandClubs: My head hurts i can’t think this much LUL
[8:59:20] Felrane: Id make him more grey. He would kill you if you dont do what he wants but our goals line up
[8:59:20] bonkyouded: He is a bad guy... but he isn't "The Bad" guy
[8:59:21] Arcmourn: Nzoth the emet selch you didn't know you had lol
[8:59:24] vtech310: I can seee it. He wont be a hero but a anti-hero thats popular right now
[8:59:25] xo_navi: wasn't the horrific vision his actual plans for what he wanted to do? LUL
[8:59:33] h00rayforstuff: yes
[8:59:33] timmythegamertv: That we know of...
[8:59:35] StreamElements: Use code POG-TOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorBot #ad
[8:59:35] balancedlight: I have noticed a recurring theme by wow. Not everything that we once thought was evil is evil and the same goes for the things we think are good. (examples... - Warlocks, DK's, Demon hunters.... all have redemption arcs.)
[8:59:38] Molvonos: Nah.  Yogg did too.
[8:59:38] havenbirch: He could save us, but use us
[8:59:39] Felrane: Yogg was freed by the Infinte flight
[8:59:43] Molvonos: And took over the area
[8:59:46] Drenakys: Even Sargeras had higher chances of becoming good. LUL
[8:59:46] bigbearjackson: enemy of my enemy thing

[9:00:13] h00rayforstuff: questionable if xal is a true old god like N'Zoth yogg and ysarj
[9:00:29] Wildsuit_: ewww petting his tentacles and eyes
[9:00:33] Bayne77: N'zoth is her precious
[9:00:39] Dinosew: Is N’zoth supposed to be the most powerful old god
[9:00:51] dyslexican1: There HAS to be a picture of that on rule34....
[9:00:58] sumppitupa: thanks for streaming all these years. sometimes you just want to hear sincere wow talk, and this is the best place for it.
[9:01:02] h00rayforstuff: N'zoth is supposed to be the weakest but the smartest and most cunning of the old gods
[9:01:03] Bayne77: n'zoth was supposed to be the weakest
[9:01:05] smashwow: @Dinosew the most cunning of them. not most raw power though.
[9:01:08] valianya: Maybe Nzoth meant he's the one to save us from Light's domination.  It's Nzoth that gave the Curse of Flesh that evolved most races from constructs
[9:01:10] Dinosew: Oh

[9:01:58] bioreducto: She a side bitch

[9:02:36] ThaOriginalGamester: LUL
[9:02:37] Vivelli: gotta keep them lore strings in the back pocket for later
[9:02:38] Wcvechten: Still think Uu'nat fight's one of my favourites of BFA, as a sidenote
[9:02:39] balancedlight: she called Elune " that upstart goddess"
[9:02:40] h00rayforstuff: could be a ton of loose ends tied up with the dragon isles
[9:02:54] viraal2784: ppl can change:D
[9:02:57] barefax: WoW doesn't do story,  getting it confused with another game
[9:02:59] Bayne77: deuces!
[9:02:59] Scoodles91: she wasnt in the boss list, why would we bother :D
[9:03:00] FirasG93: @h00rayforstuff is that confirmed?

[9:03:46] 3663Sharad: Azshara will help us with the Dargon Isles with her Naga forces 5Head
[9:03:46] Rudric_Ice: azshara can choke me Kreygasm
[9:03:47] rivera9: towStop towIt
[9:03:55] Joneeeez: We will probably see where the nagas are hiding in the next expansion, nazjatar maybe is only a fraction no idea really xD

[9:04:16] dyslexican1: You know I would like to see us have less expansions and more of a focus on patches instead. where we work on a ever advancing story. Not these loose ends that each expansion leaves us.
[9:04:19] balancedlight: Elune's power encompases all the other realms and Xalatath called her an upstart.
[9:04:23] Blackhaxx: heal her wounds !
[9:04:33] RetiredNavyVet: yeah! Welcome to WoW 2.0!!!!!!!!
[9:04:33] Rudric_Ice: HEAL DA WOONS AGAIN CHAMPION

[9:05:22] 3663Sharad: @youzeon not directly, but the portal was a voidish one and here cryptic sayings implies something like this
[9:05:23] joontet: For the Horiance!
[9:05:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, the goblins could do it
[9:05:36] lalelusa: if it turns out that Azshara was manipulated by the Jailer like Sylvanas, I'll flip a table!

[9:06:31] jacooners: whats crazy about cata is firelands is one of my fav raids
[9:06:31] vHectiKv: tell that to Menethil Harbor
[9:06:31] GivTater: I don't think azeroth is technologically advanced for that. we would have to use portals.

[9:07:31] Felrane: Making portals to other planets isn't the same as using leylines to create portals on azeroth
