[1:05:50] KCYON: classic n64 experience LUL
[1:05:56] xyxWAVExyx: requires a special cable
[1:05:58] Atomized: n64'S are REALLY finicky with modern LCD's if you're using composite cables
[1:06:02] daijahaden: Did you guys have that Jurassic Park arcade game where you sat in a booth and shot at a screen, in the states? That was the shit

[1:07:15] donkeebrainz: 100 kills, not even 100 guilds what
[1:07:16] castle_milk: Of that 100, most were same guilds
[1:07:33] AceOfFlame: Pepega mythic clearly shows actual players who play retail Pepega
[1:07:33] mrwasdead: blizz just makes the last raid bosses too hard in retail
[1:07:39] SpaceGhost8: 1000%

[1:07:56] SpaceGhost8: YEP 99% of player base doesnt care about this shit
[1:07:57] Deomas11: Yes
[1:07:59] castle_milk: They make content for 3-5 guilds...
[1:08:00] Snaketrap: YEP more time for whales
[1:08:00] KCYON: depends on who spends the most
[1:08:01] iknowido: do both
[1:08:01] Garythewop93: 100% retail sucks now
[1:08:02] myboyZach: they have to fight with weakaura playing the game for them
[1:08:03] TLBacon: in other news zack is takin a girl out to dinner rn
[1:08:03] dj_clerik: all the dad gamers are playing classic because retail is too hard now
[1:08:04] mrwasdead: just make the hardest content as hard as firelands heroic
[1:08:06] AceOfFlame: They dont seem like they care as much since their focus this entire xpac is improving the casual playerbase
[1:08:10] DuoX: thats why retail is losing steam, elite raiding guilds get better gear than heroic raiders and that makes heroic raiders not wnat to play
[1:08:13] iBanEvader: @StaysafeTV they also care way too much about lore and cinematics

[1:13:08] musicalfarts: still pump but....
[1:13:09] AceOfFlame: @KCYON Retail is easier then classic, the content is just harder at higher lvl but low mythic lvl is literally easier then doing sod bfd
[1:13:10] Tinman_VF: I feel
[1:13:12] andyjamesgames: ya dude, im in my 30s now. with the kido now, theres just no time for games like there used to be

[1:25:41] The_Original_Badman: peepoWave
[1:25:54] NutterCircus: I bet on AVG, sod players have 3 characters.
[1:25:56] iknowido: is that just first boss kills for retail?
[1:26:03] eshonxv: wrath and sod are padded by alts hard
[1:26:04] Aldeeer: I run bfd on 7 chars a reset dont think people do that on retail

[1:27:18] teblol: How do these numbers reflect the 3 day resets? Is one week numbers from 7 days?
[1:27:24] emedde: what is the average time to hit max lvl in retail? like 1-25 in sod?
[1:27:37] SaitekiTV: also, how many of those characters that did normal also did heroic?

[1:28:29] iBanEvader: raiding and pvp

[1:28:39] Aldeeer: Retail def has more overall players but sod/clasdic has way more raiders since its so accessible
[1:28:41] KCYON: (231100 + 411675 + 472264)/420 = 6.9
[1:28:42] eshonxv: those ppl still raid normal to collect the latest sets

[1:32:24] cjadude: lol
[1:32:27] iknowido: classic players yes
[1:32:34] Atomized: no difficulties
[1:32:35] KCYON: @zhuki Stare
[1:32:38] DuoX: level a character in a day and clear teh normal raid 2 days later
[1:32:40] RaveDadGabe: they need to go back to one difficulty
[1:32:41] SaitekiTV: we should totally just start at level 1 with like 20 of us
[1:32:41] Atomized: difficulties are cringe
[1:32:43] limburgse: normal is easy AF
[1:32:48] iBanEvader: mythic dungeon gear from retail is very good
[1:32:54] KCYON: lol
[1:32:56] iBanEvader: you can level to max in 1-2 days
[1:33:00] iknowido: crix is doing zero to hero right now
[1:33:03] NutterCircus: It would be nice if the game was skill based and not all gear based hamster wheeels.
[1:33:04] ScarfaceCEO: Perfect
[1:33:04] coolcrazyguy72: you can do end game dungeons and let your npc team do all the work and you get 420 lvl gear
[1:33:06] Atomized: ah, ok
[1:33:08] KKonaStevieG: true
[1:33:08] betacocos: Shit take, mythic is the only fun thing for people who like a challenge
[1:33:09] slachi: No. That means we have to raid 3 times
[1:33:11] carlos_dang3r: BASEDCIGAR
[1:33:12] KCYON: middlest
[1:33:14] Roundhere_: maybe 30 instead of 40
[1:33:14] eshonxv: multiple difficulties are fkn cringe
[1:33:15] AceOfFlame: but 40 mans are trash
[1:33:17] tsetse2fly: stay hard
[1:33:29] iBanEvader: @betacocos heroic can also be challenging
[1:33:29] Atomized: lol retail andies mad in chat
[1:33:39] Zefior: 40 is zerg raid NOPERS
[1:33:48] RaveDadGabe: they should just nerf it as time goes on. everyone working on the same difficulty builds a community. all the difficulty and gears makes it fractured.
[1:33:55] Lionkingler1: YEP asmon is just a casual

[1:34:21] KCYON: i dont really enjoy 30+
[1:34:22] brentosxd: His opinion changed so much, used to watch his elitism videos back in the day
[1:34:25] iBanEvader: HC revival when?
[1:34:29] Lionkingler1: asmon hates classic leveling KEKW
[1:34:34] slachi: Vanilla ends with Deadmines. Everthing else is postgame
[1:34:36] AceOfFlame: I love HC since people have to actually play the game and not jerk off to their 2nd monitor using their auto attacks 4Head
[1:34:39] fuguelah: 20-30 is the best
[1:34:52] betacocos: Last 1 or 2 bosses in heroic can be challenging some tiers but if you're playing with a guild it will not last you very long
[1:34:52] iBanEvader: the HC servers are so dead atm lol
[1:34:52] NutterCircus: The game is too unreliable to think HC is a good game.
[1:35:01] Lionkingler1: to beat hard content you need to be focused? very shoking take
[1:35:03] Lunights: this dude beat himself recently for sucking in prince of persia lmao
[1:35:12] KCYON: thats why souls games are seasonal too
[1:35:18] Luuuie: hc has at least 50% tism

[1:36:51] iknowido: its what an adult should think lol
[1:36:51] tondo22: tldr asmon hates retail

[2:00:59] jak_gaming: the fuck is a mile
[2:01:00] dodgydad33: SHooter

[2:01:16] jimmythegents: I've walked 20 miles before and f****** Pittsburgh on Christmas Eve
[2:01:16] QuestFor420: you gotta understand the workup to it tho
[2:01:18] starvis89: Your in gamer shape
[2:01:20] LemonWarrior93: you gotta condition your feet @staysafetv or else they’ll for sure get fucked up @staysafetv
[2:01:25] Nonnpoint: just remember your injury is not service related
[2:01:26] dj_clerik: you have dad strength now though
[2:01:27] Qworalmarker: in 10 feet of snow
[2:01:31] 1Horsepower: with no elevation gain that would be a long day for an untrained person, with elevation gain you will die or quite for sure
[2:01:42] ajunta__: we used to do that once every 3 months shit sucked wasnt a good time cause the whole group goes on the same pace
[2:01:42] Dabtronaut: my coworker goes on hikes/marches like that all the time, she was in the army! @StaysafeTV
[2:01:47] Humansoup: 123
[2:01:54] dj_clerik: No mail in the raid KEKW
[2:02:14] KKonaStevieG: Just load your ruck with pillows and pretend it's heavy

[2:02:40] KKonaStevieG: Ye break those boots in
[2:02:40] EarSlug: boots and a good bag is a must
[2:02:47] LemonWarrior93: get an Alice pack @staysafetv
[2:02:50] Roundhere_: ooo what kind
[2:02:50] donkeebrainz: i think in the marines we went at like 3.5 mph and took a short break every hr or so
[2:03:01] yuckil: weighted vest vs backpack?
[2:03:04] daijahaden: Do you have a panzerkampfwagen vi königstiger?
[2:03:09] Roundhere_: nice, i have 6

[2:03:40] donkeebrainz: backpack is very important
[2:03:44] donkeebrainz: fuck up your back real quick
[2:03:48] 1Horsepower: dont use boots, classic noob mistake, use trail runners
[2:04:05] puddug: timbs and a yankee fitted w the brim
[2:04:12] LeStone21: ^ seconded trail runners bis
[2:04:23] Humansoup: True
[2:04:24] chaos_terrain: definitely
[2:04:26] yuckil: terrain matters lol

[2:05:10] QuestFor420: hahahahahhaha
[2:05:12] donkeebrainz: need to see trebbies dps on every boss
[2:05:14] TyrDraco: and this is why we cant ahve nice things
[2:05:15] LeStone21: not true, have terrible ankles and roll them less without tall hiking boots.  you pay more attention to them, plus you feel the ground better in trail runners
[2:05:22] DuoX: typical horde
[2:05:23] 1Horsepower: boots do not prevent that - they just move the problem to your knees, anyone who does gnarly stuff in the mountains regularly isnt using boots (but obviously you need time out there training)
[2:05:31] DeltaBased: that was self defense
[2:05:32] yuckil: thats an hk EZ
[2:05:47] dj_clerik: 1 tank, no windfury, no mail KEKW

[2:07:46] seymourmoney: You go a little bit accross some boarders and the swiss love their guns
[2:07:49] 1Horsepower: My German coworker visited and shot one of my guns, was grinning for 3 hours afterwards, super psyched on it
[2:07:57] dj_clerik: it's been fucked here the last week with all the snow tbf
[2:08:23] aoe_enjoyer: any demons in this raid? KEKW
[2:08:42] Synbrah: sstvDUMB
[2:08:47] 1Horsepower: hes young though probably anyone that grew up playing FPS games that hasn't shot a real gun is going to love doing it
[2:08:52] zhuki: Are You There God, It's Me Margaret
[2:09:13] charlemagne_ix: I also have a volkswagen atlas, love it

[2:10:04] jak_gaming: it has only taken 25 years to upgrade 4x4 FFS
[2:10:13] donkeebrainz: @sigilfish you better not touch my wheels bitch
[2:10:17] 1Horsepower: @zhuki no 4wd cars have a transfer case that sends 50/50 split front to rear, AWD have a differential that is active all the time and can spit power unevenly generally
[2:10:21] DeltaBased: LUL
[2:10:24] Tinman_VF: fire pot
[2:10:25] Kielen: fake exhaust thou !!!!
