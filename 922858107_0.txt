[0:26:59] Frank4LuLz: blizz dev haters killed titan because of wow
[0:27:07] Stahlram: I always imagine every manager/boss as the guy from office space KEKW
[0:27:10] Aervyper: Valheim was my wow killer LOL
[0:27:39] EnragedSushi: How? You typically cant return to things once they're killed
[0:27:41] MrGattz: valheim is so great but i almost want to stop playing it just becuase i know only 50% of the game is actually in the game atm
[0:27:42] EnragedSushi: :)
[0:27:50] blucifer1320: If anything kills wow it’s going to be riot
[0:27:51] RocketvanPersie: mmos dont have to be wow killers and i think thats been the issue with mmos

[0:29:41] EnragedSushi: WoW is too just... A THING to be killed.
[0:29:42] Stahlram: yea I believe Riot can make a great mmo with ghostcrawler in the lead
[0:29:44] MuttonChopins: it is ghostccrwaler confirmed it @TweakT

[0:30:31] Aervyper: @EnragedSushi and looking at Blizzard right now they doing a fine job of killing WoW
[0:30:36] EnragedSushi: @udrisyay nailed it
[0:30:49] HDrx: 100% share KEKW
[0:30:49] EnragedSushi: WoW is completely fine right now haha

[0:32:38] PotbellyGoat: what do you think of Immortal trying to have some MMO aspects?
[0:32:40] EnragedSushi: Sell more transmogs
[0:32:42] TweakT: make every piece of clothing a micro transaction
[0:32:44] TweakT: mountain of money
[0:32:49] EnragedSushi: Blizzard always 50% adapts to that stuff.
[0:33:08] Masqerader: they will probably POE everyone for stash space too

[0:56:36] Vaeyra_Max: zangarmarsh <3
[0:56:38] Masqerader: Nagrand/SMV were my favorite
[0:56:38] wisperuna: @Towelliee Zangramsh was hte most chilll zones
[0:56:42] TheUnknowing: Blades Edge I feel like is the only zone I didnt like

[0:57:26] Masqerader: Ogri'la and simon says lol
[0:57:29] TweakT: Nagrand was grand for its time
[0:57:39] TweakT: it's literally in the name
[0:57:40] InTheDM: TBC zones were amazing compared to anything else at the time haha
[0:57:41] Seerated: Netherstorm had alot of great tanking-items while questing, love that place
[0:57:43] TheCliffyShow: Nagrand was pretty. Although, the Hemingwary quests can fuck off.
[0:58:01] Masqerader: u mean the shatari skayguard?
[0:58:09] colpit: as a skimmer the hemingwary quest were the best
[0:58:10] blucifer1320: The crappy prt of being on a normal vs pvp server is you can’t take control of the elemental plateau
[0:58:15] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I dont understand, are they going to offer lvl 60/58 boosts?
[0:58:17] 2chest_1head: I did Shatari Skyguard wxalted twice, before the shared achieves

[0:59:01] blucifer1320: Should lvl one and then boost one
[0:59:04] Stahlram: not monetising tbc classic would be such a mistake, business wise
[0:59:06] iceproxx: you have to pay for boost
[0:59:07] AirmVn: I think they did not think about it because they expected it to fail
[0:59:07] blucifer1320: Get 2 70s easy

[0:59:53] blucifer1320: I’m thinking mage/priest but idk
[0:59:56] zPossum: you dont take many mages in raids tho
[0:59:59] hooliggan: @Towelliee glad I finally got the 194 hymnal
[1:00:00] peinen: @bluebeast33 What was the drums meta?
[1:00:04] Kelmor: there was a trick in 5mans for prot warriors, Ciderhelm came up with it, we used the pet that would damage us (turn green) to get threat/rage once unhittable.. Go get that pet $$ ;)
[1:00:05] zPossum: except in the last raid
[1:00:07] blucifer1320: You have to have a mage for gruul

[1:13:28] Renzir: today and tmr @PadidinJones
[1:13:35] TheUnknowing: I think the beta will be out before 9.1 but I think TBC would be around july / august which i think would be fine
[1:13:55] GRVPHX: ohh beta yes
[1:14:05] k0nvick_: the thing is actvi wants a big boost before earnings. TBC would supply that big cash boost 9.1 wouldnt. Thats why you saw so much info on tbc and all retail got was some crumbs
[1:14:16] peinen: August feels like right
[1:14:16] BlueBeast33: 9.1 will definitely be first
[1:14:24] EnragedSushi: TBC is free
[1:14:26] zPossum: i feel like theyll give the people to level max 2 weeks
[1:14:29] EnragedSushi: With a sub
[1:14:38] ritiredgamer: @Towelliee I flipped with the coin son of galleon sadle today :D i had about 300 kills
[1:14:38] belfastcl: i hope they give us like a month to level draeneis and blood elves
[1:14:43] TheUnknowing: I think a month to 2 months would be a good for prepatch
[1:14:49] MuttonChopins: 2 weeks is way little time to level to max
[1:15:07] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee wasn't the idea of classic before blizz got involved was people playing servers , then maxing out , and then they start it all over again. how will those players like all this
[1:15:11] zPossum: paladin leveling is so bad solo
