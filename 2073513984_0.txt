[0:13:19] lord_konstantine: One advantage of having a shit time when young is that you dont reminisce with nostalgia about those days xdd
[0:13:58] Taroux10: Arguably, healing in WoW has the highest skill cap, especially in dungeons, because you‚Äôre trying to min-max active hps with active dps. Whereas tanking is maxmizing group survivability and dps is just staying alive and maximizing dps
[0:13:58] 0_0memes: have you do a video on hero talent things ?

[1:12:53] guineverenol: the ui now. you used to have to get a bartender or elv or smthing
[1:13:08] boluqt: ban weakauras and boss mods 95% of this games problems are solved
[1:13:25] thargonian: they don't have to. If they just had a set difficulty it would eventualy settle down
[1:13:26] LightdarkGaming: if the addons didnt exist, it would have even less playerbase
[1:13:28] AvalenaTV: like echo of neltharion, the perfect no weakaura boss Kappa
[1:13:43] bear_lifter: If you want no addons go play FF14
[1:13:52] criselbart: isnt it just that things that are solved by addons are inherently bad forms of difficulty?
[1:14:00] LuiBMHunter: people want retail to be like classic? ammo for hunters  reagents to do load sof spells? - are they nuts?
[1:14:04] LightdarkGaming: all raid bosses would be the same, without possibility of WA, u can do only as many mechanics to be different
[1:14:05] ShaggySummers: @LightdarkGaming or way more because blizz would make an actually readable game
[1:14:07] TerraTuned: @yumytv i play retail with minimal ads, blizz UI and bigwigs/lilwigs + details and its fun to me and looks pretty, 3.4rio healer

[1:37:59] bingo_roswell: How do some Americans play with EU players? don‚Äôt they get omega high ping?
[1:37:59] Ajatus: @HaveYouSeenMikey theres also a difference where thats actually a backwards preventing wall not a forward progress preventing wall
[1:38:02] Craftthu: Wonder if you can use warlock port to replace/assist if need be
[1:38:09] Ajatus: which is the same deal with the volkal wall
[1:38:09] IAttackYou: Pauck wtf

[1:41:23] bear_lifter: It's incredibly squishy and dependent on 2m cooldowns, plus Aug exists, yeah

[1:45:05] vellocets: did jake lionman get KOed?
[1:45:12] MimiBear21: they didn't put the key on 0 when /pull 10 ended xdd
[1:45:14] bingo_roswell: the fishing net mog is awesome
[1:45:28] Ajatus: no he went 1-2 but i think had the tiebreaker to not be last @vellocets
[1:45:50] numenusty: What is the CD of inferno?
[1:45:58] blacklight_____: @numenusty 3
[1:46:02] Razdruid: by holding it hes lost 2 infernals
[1:46:16] Razdruid: one on the last pack
[1:46:17] guineverenol: its bc yarrgi is using the masystine bug net tech
[1:46:18] Razdruid: one of this boss
[1:46:22] Ajatus: key timer isnt long enough to have lost 2 uses yet
[1:46:24] Razdruid: it might be a ui bug
[1:46:33] toseguri: toseguri subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:47:05] yctnm: deja vu
[1:47:12] Slaitz: Inferno used now
[1:47:18] Razdruid: so not a UI bug
[1:47:30] guineverenol: didn't a different team send the gate up from the bottom yesterday?
[1:47:30] Ajatus: they swapped to a safer  but less good gate the 2nd run they did yesterday
[1:48:08] epilepticunicorn_: no shot you need infernal to 1phase
[1:48:30] IAmSolari: say how this route reminds you of P2 raszageth
[1:48:34] darkshad0w808: mandatory PI'ing warlock without infernal
[1:48:47] roberterino19: @darkshad0w808 hes not gonna use it till last boss
[1:48:49] Ajatus: @darkshad0w808 its the better target still
[1:48:57] riiirn: isnt there an argument to just play demo if you hold infernal that hard
[1:49:08] huo_junzhang: maystine is missin a whole ass infernal, how is that worth lol
[1:49:32] Niroggo: xdd
[1:49:39] epilepticunicorn_: people are putting way too much value about infernal. its not even close to as good as other cds

[1:50:03] yungbooma: @riiirn the whole reason destro is picked over demo rn is that it has funnel/prio damage in mass pulls

[1:55:25] marcofellipe69: 1-16
[1:55:44] marcofellipe69: even if it's easier, not missing easy kicks in big pulls
[1:55:52] Boossterr: their doing something right because this mdi is arguably the most entertaining, I like the key level we‚Äôre still seeing wipes just bigger pulls
[1:56:06] gfvaris: WHAT A TAKE
[1:56:16] gfvaris: a game is more interesting if its close omg
[1:56:20] gfvaris: SO SMART

[1:57:09] shultsy: what if it was like TGP but like set key lvl and just time
[1:57:11] bingo_roswell: seems like most guys prefer the TGP format
[1:57:14] IAmSolari: this MDI has been really interesting idk
[1:57:15] shultsy: so i guess what jb is saying
[1:57:21] Ajatus: @shultsy thats what last stand was

[1:58:59] simplepathwow: BASEG
[1:59:02] marcofellipe69: A mix of hard dungeons and easy dungeons does seem to be the goal, leaning towards mostly easily. But they do 24 fortified bolstered keys, which does make the dungeon linear in a different way
[1:59:03] Boossterr: worst take, i deplete everyone‚Äôs keys
[1:59:06] Scarrboros: Cooking
[1:59:07] shultsy: that would be so toxic, but low key fun

[1:59:29] reppap: thats not a significant improvement over the current system
[1:59:29] thargonian: Please
[1:59:30] stormz_wow: how about when we deplete a key, liquid should lose a game to echo
[1:59:31] Nuublet: pug depleting my key
[1:59:35] smashi_tv: LETHIMPLINK
[1:59:40] marcofellipe69: In easy dungeons the pulls are at least crazy and have the chance making something go wrong
[1:59:41] Niroggo: WHOLETHIMCOOK
[1:59:44] bingo_roswell: If growl is plink i am plonk of them
[1:59:48] danaxvx: only one person gets the reward too
[1:59:48] Adrang: i never run my key anyways, doesnt bother me
[1:59:58] danaxvx: people gotta get rewarded too if there's a group punishment
[2:00:00] ConchubarOD: max only one had a leaver??
[2:00:00] Kraave: oh lets just make depleting a key feel that much better
[2:00:00] shultsy: leavers are so aids
[2:00:04] nightbreeze93: max has only ever has 1 leaver ever? what?
[2:00:05] bingo_roswell: leavers got very bad in DF
[2:00:06] ConchubarOD: mans disconnected af
[2:00:06] yctnm: I want to play in max's version of the game
[2:00:09] teddyg55: using your own key is only something DPS need to do
[2:00:09] gloomygl: I'll leave if the key looks dead not gonna lie
[2:00:10] thargonian: We don't need the system to be even more punnishing than it is WHOLETHIMCOOK
[2:00:17] hulkadiggah: Must be nice
[2:00:21] marcofellipe69: I think the potential in easy dungeon allow for some crazy fun shit, harder dungeons limit stuff like throne and wayrest
[2:00:24] bingo_roswell: this is an omega cooked take by max
[2:00:33] unodapally: Bring onezeroth to talk about leavers in keys
[2:00:36] Nuublet: i had 2 of those this season
[2:00:36] talkley: if u leave a key jsut give them an hour dungeon deserter :)
[2:00:37] Droodensteinburg: leavers are 100% a problem in low keys
[2:00:41] thargonian: But I would be for if you leave you depleate
[2:01:00] Nuublet: ive had it twice in semi high keys
[2:01:07] Nuublet: where someone didnt want the deplete
[2:01:19] AyeLoud: It's mainly weird when you're at the level where some people are playing for IO and others just want to complete. Over 25 is most chill
[2:01:19] Boossterr: well If blizzard follows through with that my weekly key will be a -20 every week
[2:01:37] Scarrboros: BASEG
[2:01:43] ClipCraft: i've been in a lot of keys where someone says its depleted but then still time it lol
[2:01:46] Adrang: usually people dont know if key is dead or not
[2:01:46] JulesMcSwaggerak: finish for vualt
[2:01:47] marcofellipe69: also remember ruby life pools in season 1 and some of those dungeons, people are dying to healing checks because they go into boss with 0 juice
[2:01:48] danaxvx: let me finish
[2:01:55] marcofellipe69: even in mdi
[2:01:58] gloomygl: People don't wanna be the first to leave, I take the bullet

[2:02:21] minglium: JB, omegalul
[2:02:23] Thatsafy: increase the key level by +6 when you time a key EZ
[2:02:37] talkley: remove the deplete and just grant rewards on fastness
[2:02:43] reppap: max has two responses to jb saying something, it's either hard change subject or going "i said that already"
[2:02:51] Peepars: I think they should stop scaling dungeons after 26 and just start reducing the timer
[2:02:51] t4pekid: do another achieve for 3k keystone megalord
[2:02:58] Destrolisher: YAPPP

[2:03:35] ChronycPain: 60 gold is plenty of reward for a +30 key if you ask me
[2:03:36] danaxvx: m+ should drop more gold
[2:03:38] shultsy: has there been a TGP this xpac?
[2:03:48] danaxvx: @shultsy last season
[2:03:55] Adrang: @t4pekid then people will jsut say theres no reward between 3k and title. M+ is infinite scaling, rewards should just have "infinite" scaling too. Like every 500 points is another tier
[2:03:55] ssj_lenin: YES

[2:04:30] scherri5: give us sick weapon tmogs like in challenge mode
[2:04:32] Razdruid: but also this xpac seasonal mounts are legit dogshit
[2:04:32] dergNwolf: why are seasonal pvp mounts so GOOD and we get recolors of an ugly ass mount for m+
[2:04:44] Razdruid: like making mounts that not only can;t fly but not dragonflying either
[2:04:56] AyeLoud: Just give +25's those coins that you can pick as backup from vault
[2:05:09] AyeLoud: so you can run 6 for a socket for example

[2:51:17] MBG_95: What are your thoughts on no double elimination?

[2:56:04] jenkinsdonuttv: We stan DAWGS

[2:56:28] jenkinsdonuttv: @zolozw Echo got sent to lower brackets by dawgs, but then went on to win group A
[2:56:34] baseboned: it's 8 seconds
[2:57:13] baseboned: yes
[2:57:16] marcofellipe69: I wonder if sub shroud works with fast asf rocket boy mode

[2:57:31] ShaggySummers: love me my CR
[2:57:33] xzamolodx: This is what makes me lose hope in WOW when an entire role gets trivialized
[2:57:48] baseboned: it's one mdi dungeon, it ain't that serious
[2:58:02] Arkanheal: True, MDI is the real game
[2:58:06] epilepticunicorn_: nope wow is over
[2:58:09] ShaggySummers: @xzamolodx it's the worlds best players. You'll be just fine
[2:58:10] epilepticunicorn_: uninstalling now
[2:58:20] Adrang: also, trivialized is not the word id use for these teams playing
[2:58:21] purplenbrown: can you bet on mdi? what if echo made quick buck of losing to dawgs? can we check this?
[2:58:34] crossTTA: what makes me lose hope in wow is how lukewarm iq 99% of the playerbase is basing their opinions about the game on tournament play
[2:58:56] ShaggySummers: @crossTTA tbh 99% of players have their opinions off 3 streamers
[2:59:08] baseboned: actually I think 99% of the player base doesn't even know mdi exists
[2:59:08] Adrang: most people cant clear a 10 without a healer
[2:59:17] epilepticunicorn_: 99% of players arent watching streams
[2:59:19] Arkanheal: @baseboned True and real
[2:59:24] ShaggySummers: @Adrang and that's fine
[2:59:36] baseboned: @epilepticunicorn_ yup
[2:59:37] Adrang: it is, but it also means no healer runs arent trivial
[2:59:45] marcofellipe69: I think most high level teams plan around their routes around 2-3 minutes trying to make a 10 minute run with 5 2 minutes
[3:00:57] akakofluffa: Seeing how you can clear 23 without a healer makes me seriously wonder why I need to waste all my cds on dps in 20s just to keep them alive for the next pull
[3:01:59] baseboned: you're surprised pugs are less coordinated with kicks and stops than mdi teams who practice 100 hours?
[3:02:06] crossTTA: ^ like what?
[3:02:08] mcmanman_pwns: is that cataclysm
[3:02:34] baseboned: it does drive home just how avoidable a lot of damage is tho
[3:02:47] AyeLoud: Hey we saw the resto shammy, that's smt
[3:02:47] crossTTA: Which is a good thing
[3:03:03] crossTTA: if all of that damage was unavoidable healer deal with it damage people would bitch 10x more
[3:03:31] vellocets: whoa that dragon skip is sick
[3:03:46] purplenbrown: MDI is only interesting for like top 4 in world
[3:03:57] WhiteMMamba: H2H is so much more entertaining to watch
[3:04:19] MimiBear21: growl check geo finals
[3:04:25] baseboned: as a healer I like some unavoidable damage checks, like halls of infusion third boss, but it's a tricky thing from a design perspective to place that importance on healer
[3:04:46] Lolgoat: I like MDI. TGP is so like.. You can't attentatively watch it for the full 5 hours, you kinda go in and out, but you sometimes miss cool stuff if you do. For MDI it's more "on"
[3:04:51] WildiFan420: HEALERS
[3:05:00] Razdruid: yeah but that is healthier for the players imagine how much more practice they need to do
[3:05:01] crossTTA: Yeah I mean it's good to have SOME but if it gets to the point where all dps have to do is do big dam and rely on healer to not suck it's just as bad as healers relying on dps to not suck with stops n kicks
[3:05:04] marcofellipe69: 1-2 minute classes with class buffs that buff each other with w stops, this comp OP
[3:05:13] purplenbrown: tettles has some anime hair today
[3:05:15] Ajatus: @Lolgoat just be more degenerate and then tgp is perfect
[3:05:17] mattchewk: I have been saying tgp format but head to head, hour to 90 min time slots for matches and bo3 grand finals
[3:05:22] WildiFan420: OMEGALUL

[3:05:44] realJoebear: realJoebear subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[3:07:08] admanb: p sure it's 3rd
[3:07:24] purplenbrown: Despairge imagine m+ is still a thing in 15 years
[3:07:53] epilepticunicorn_: wasnt it JB saying yesterday that you need to give the teams respect because they earned it and now he wants to cut them from the tournament
[3:08:04] admanb: I want to play M+ in my retirement home
[3:08:16] admanb: j/k i'll never be able to retire. but imagine
[3:08:20] shultsy: with some strategic, possibly unethical, parenting strats that m+ team could be competing by the last of those 3 xpacs that got announced
[3:08:32] baseboned: that's true for any tournament, like march madness, you can't avoid some teams being better
[3:08:54] epilepticunicorn_: just dont hold the tourney. give echo the trophy and call it a day
[3:09:09] kimkop: @epilepticunicorn_ true
[3:09:10] admanb: @shultsy if you can have a six year old violin prodigy you can definitely have a six year old rogue player
[3:09:29] marcofellipe69: I think it gives screen to potential players like stovebingo
[3:09:32] Ajatus: didnt perplexed one phase earlier today against eclipse?
[3:09:33] marcofellipe69: allowing those teams to play
[3:09:40] marcofellipe69: or Kira and eclipse last year

[4:34:14] MierkaBlue: I agree
[4:34:17] darkgigaz: Based take
[4:34:18] anaya909: so all this basically = gw2
[4:34:20] Cruzerthebruzer: who even cares if people get gear I don't get the gating
[4:34:33] Northernlad: when you grind your renown the gear is 20ivls below what you get in M+ or raid
[4:34:45] ShaggySummers: facts. Nobody cares if casual 17653 has max ilvl right now
[4:34:53] MierkaBlue: yeah, ilvl is fun and being strong and being able to do things is fun
[4:34:54] ShaggySummers: except for casual 17653
[4:34:58] ultrareal_: item level does matter because you gotta solo elite mobs in the world when no one is doing them anymore for mog lol
[4:34:58] wildwittra: I would like that reputation gear-ilevel was increased for higher reputation and increased for each patch
[4:35:02] trbs32: it does seem like a lot of high level players just don‚Äôt want to deal with gear/progression at all. they want the bis to get into the super challenging content
[4:35:10] xbarkath: archeology :D
[4:35:13] Juicewolff: based take that‚Äôs me. only heroic raid
[4:35:25] RamblingJosh_: ilvl inflation is also awful these days, so a casual will have like 50% of a mythic players' health
[4:35:29] marcofellipe69: true
[4:35:31] VzualLeader: very true
[4:35:32] dknamey: aint no way whatt
[4:35:45] ibejake: this is an unironic good take.
[4:35:50] Lidorissa: BASED
[4:36:00] anaya909: when those players reach max gear they say there's nothing to do and quit
[4:36:00] MierkaBlue: this season we took most of our casual raiders to 20 keys because it was possible and they could finally learn by doing
[4:36:01] autumnbugle: there's a very vocal minority that can get 95% BiS gear and is ADAMANT no one else deserves it
[4:36:31] cochiko: Chasing gear/goals in an RPG is fun, and more ways to chase those goals is just more fun
[4:36:45] thebarron00: incredibly based takes
[4:36:46] theskot: Character getting more powerful is the whole idea behind MMOs
[4:36:48] theskot: well RPGs
[4:36:51] jenkinsdonuttv: Would make more WoW players sweaty long term. We love some sweet gamer sweat
[4:36:59] talkley: unironically let people que for M+ it would get rid of people trying to only pick X class for their +4
[4:37:03] MierkaBlue: We have so many people who have no grinded portals first time ever in my heroic raid group and people are loving it, feeling more confident and most of them have started to put in more effort and learn the game more
[4:37:06] optionalkick: Torghast
[4:37:06] RamblingJosh_: And Blizzard clearly agrees, you can see them doing things like adding world content to the vault
[4:37:22] RudeDinosaur: I think at the very least you should be able to do this for Hero track gear...only 6IL difference, and keeps to mythic raid and higher m+ "special"
[4:37:26] Bierinfusion: yeah but then everyone feels pressured againt to be delving every week
[4:37:28] kaspagre: This would most likely turn out just into another mythic raider chore :D
[4:37:29] Bierinfusion: no?
[4:37:32] darkgigaz: Make regular bgs great again
[4:37:33] MierkaBlue: <3
[4:37:36] K4lsdern: maxProc
[4:37:38] Its_Stuart: 10/10 max impression
[4:37:38] MimiBear21: maxProc
[4:37:43] Toticki: nice

[4:38:06] Vods: catJAM
[4:38:06] Nightbot: catJAM
[4:38:10] sprechwe1se: bro said his piece and dropped the mic
[4:38:36] gacha______: bro is eminem in 8MILE
[4:41:31] particles2: hey growl and chat, how was the MDI today? I missed out was at work
[4:41:38] flockheart: balatro Looking
[4:41:39] JGTheStorytime: boring
[4:41:55] sundihyr: balatro time let's go
[4:41:56] Ajatus: i dont think that was a question he was calling you rabbit
[4:42:02] Ajatus: for your monologue
[4:42:20] Cruzerthebruzer: where's the civ 6 stream
[4:42:28] autumnbugle: Rabbit is his name in 8 Mile
[4:42:31] Ajatus: rabbit is em's nickname in the movie
[4:42:45] autumnbugle: it's a never ending chain of confusion
[4:44:02] blacklight_____: black deck is so fucked
[4:44:33] AntiNyx: I think im in the flush trap where i try to force them too hard
[4:45:48] Na5noo5: what's is the revisited raid in s4 ? like every week we got different raid from 1 of the 3 seasons ?
[4:45:54] Ajatus: yes
[4:46:28] astrinovska: dinars lgwPaws
[4:46:41] jellowgamer: jellowgamer subscribed with Prime. 
[4:47:02] b1azzuris: GIGACAT
[4:47:40] fuyrae: is there a cheat death trinket that healers could buy with dinars?
[4:48:35] sprechwe1se: u think tbc or wrath dungs will eventually be brought back for m+
[4:49:21] merc0725: wise mari monkaW
[4:49:27] merc0725: killed many
[4:50:02] IAttackYou: Hey Growl, Dorki got number 2 in cups. Dooki is also number 2. Does it mean that Dorki is Dooki
[4:50:05] IAttackYou: ayayaxdd
[4:50:26] IAttackYou: its math
[4:50:44] t4pekid: 500k or Dinner with Dorki
[4:51:03] IAttackYou: transitive property
[4:51:15] glutton420: have u met dorki in person?
[4:51:17] YakSlacks: i think hed understand xD
[4:51:18] IAttackYou: whats with these cracked takes
[4:51:20] epilepticunicorn_: with 500k you can have dinner with dorki and money
[4:51:21] t4pekid: but dorki could give you life changing insight
[4:51:25] Ajatus: dinner with dorki is passive income though
[4:51:35] travtravtrav_: 500k is useless once you get higher ante, id go with dinner w/ dorki
[4:51:41] othernewname: 500k or never talk to dorki again
[4:51:43] IAttackYou: what dinner would you get
[4:51:55] sprechwe1se: ok but whos the biggest yapper, jb or max
[4:52:04] YakSlacks: dinner with dorki: two cats in a zoom call at a restaurant?
