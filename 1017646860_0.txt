[0:44:00] DuploThief: I spend 250 euro's yesterday on all the world of Warcraft books zo hyped to Read Them @towelliee

[0:44:21] astranna: you need to look up what each piece requires in terms of marks

[0:44:40] geraldtgnome: @Towelliee nice rebuild , can I post you a link to mine please

[0:44:42] UhhNadda: honor system resets when prepatch comes out
[0:44:46] chrslp: A full set of PvP gear without weapons will set you back 65025 honor points, 50 Alterac Valley marks, 70 Arathi Basin marks, and 30 Warsong Gulch marks.
[0:44:46] HyperChief: The vendor is up on PTR if youw anted to see the prices

[0:45:14] astranna: there arent ranks in pre patch
[0:45:14] katkis88: @Towelliee its about 15k honor and 20 marks per item, weapons cost AV marks, armor trinkents are WSG and AB marks
[0:45:17] chrslp: 65k honor ez LUL
[0:45:19] Gizimoo86: @chrslp without weapons holy thats a lot
[0:45:20] Grandzfer: bugs, why did it have to be bugs....
[0:45:26] MIKEBRASKA: what @chrslp said
[0:45:38] onecheeksqueek: epic music for searching for mithiril lol
[0:45:42] chrslp: Just do lots of AV for honor and farm marks. Wont be terribly hard
[0:45:45] source__2: @Towelliee What 2021 movie are you looking forwards to the most: Dune, The Batman, or Matrix 4
[0:45:52] ArcaneSyntax: looking forward to grinding 40k honor and 40 AB marks for weapons.
[0:46:10] Gizimoo86: Way too much work for 2 weeks, maybe get couple items but thats it
[0:46:44] ArcaneSyntax: my goal was to just get weapons and anything after that is just gravy
[0:46:44] chrslp: Are there changes to how much honor you get in prepatch? Because I'm getting about 100-150k honor a week when I pvp
[0:46:57] MIKEBRASKA: 63-65ish, 100% by Ring of Blood
[0:47:12] chrslp: Its a good way to kill time if you're not leveling a BE
[0:47:17] chrslp: Otherwise maybe not worth it
[0:47:18] Pbazza117: Is the 58 boost available in the pre patch phase?
[0:47:24] katkis88: theres not SP weapon that pallys can use sadly :(

[1:09:08] chrslp: My neighbors must think I have corona between my dab coughing and my allergy sneezes, sniffling, and coughing LUL
[1:09:27] thetruegodofwarr: allergies for many people are worse this year due to everyone staying inside so much
[1:09:30] Thunderbrew: Las Vegas is allergy season year round
[1:09:30] stjon13: dude think it's bad there try the NC pollen
[1:09:31] Densetsu_: Most don't notice it for sure.
[1:09:54] Xsilentghost: Well I think the soul of working blizzard is gone when they arent in the office
[1:10:15] Thunderbrew: The Devs need to be back in the office for sure
[1:10:18] Kadvan: @stjon13 no joke, nothing compares to NC pollen season
[1:10:19] pavepawns: well he said development powers and resources which means they dont have access to their full resources or am i wrong?
[1:10:40] chrslp: Because those industrial filter systems in the casinos LUL
[1:10:46] oddspin: towellie did you killed mythic dena?

[1:11:45] havenbirch: Asmongold loves the game, he doesn't want to quit - quitting won't make the game better.
[1:12:18] dimmrill: He wants the game to be as godd as it can get, so having people still play it to voice their opinion is important, at the same time dont be content by BS from BLizz
[1:12:43] dimmrill: no yeye I get it, its just what I got from it
[1:12:50] Thunderbrew: I love alt leveling, low level mythic dungeons and Normal raiding. I can't get into leveling Alts in Shadowlands, not sure why.
[1:12:57] dalaraz: you cant tell people that the prices are shit and its a scam,ending with ill buy it anyway :S
[1:13:03] Broomba: Asmon watched an Athene video on twitch and athene watched him watch the video on his twitch it was interesting
[1:13:07] Aquadriel: I personally think the games systems the devs are implementing are not bad, but there is an issue with the amount of weird restrictions they put on them, some are a bit incomprehensible.
[1:13:08] bruhSit_farmer: he is struggling with the game lol but what i resonated with was his statement the game should not be "world of raidcraft" ...the world needs to feel alive again
[1:13:10] dalaraz: what i didnt like was the lying titles
[1:14:04] bruhSit_farmer: you and him can take activision down, horde and alliance finally join forces
[1:14:11] bruhSit_farmer: ;P
[1:14:57] 2MakeMe: he paid for one
[1:15:01] druagh: Bellular is just an angry bitter dude that complains all the time
[1:15:11] dalaraz: still 9/10
[1:15:11] dimmrill: @druagh LOL
[1:15:12] bruhSit_farmer: nah bellular is necessary too
[1:15:17] WayneG947: thats why i play the first 3 months of an expansion, unsub for the next 12-18 months and play the last 2-3 months of the same expansion. Its like playing 2 different games
[1:15:26] bruhSit_farmer: fuck your positivty bubble @druagh
[1:15:32] mintcookie_vajankle: Bellular is just a typical journalist.
[1:15:47] druagh: @dimmrill haha
[1:15:54] WayneG947: Bellular is not bitter, its called honesty
[1:15:57] chrslp: When does the Dark Portal Opening Event happen? Is it like the very end of prepatch?
[1:16:02] chrslp: With the demons and shit
[1:16:08] 2MakeMe: thats a hard thing to interpret lol
[1:16:08] pixxelina: it is bipolar, honestly
[1:16:09] Broomba: He was all over the place
[1:16:12] justlnquisitive: That's why you always proofread before you submit your paper, kids. :)
[1:16:15] WayneG947: journalists like to use it in ways to get rises out of people
[1:16:19] druagh: its honesty when everything he posts is just angry and he sounds bitter
[1:16:30] Funderik: the problem is, he thinks he's speaking for the community, but he's only speaking for himself and his audience mainly
[1:16:45] dalaraz: @druagh you prolly just learned bellular i think,he is not bitter generally
[1:16:58] Sarocus: I haven't paid attention to Bellular in years. Too much clickbait
[1:17:06] quakegoogl: draRage PopCorn
[1:17:11] superphunphap: sup towelie!
[1:17:14] dimmrill: @druagh Thats not true though. He is extremely passionate on the lore front, raids and m+ dungeons. Its the general features and gameplay loop he (rightfully) criticize
[1:17:20] superphunphap: /drink
[1:17:26] pixxelina: thanks for this sober opinion :)
[1:17:29] constantinfive: u have a market value dud for the gaming companyes :)

[1:18:01] Aquadriel: i think he said that more in the sense of "keep playing but also raise your voice to demand changes". But i agree with you on it sounding a bit bipolar
[1:18:02] Komatiq: I think he just wants to the see the game at it best like everyone else

[1:19:27] Aquadriel: shadowlands? more like RESTRICTION LANDS KEKW
[1:19:30] thiccsushi: I just wish they made these features like torghast fun but completely optional instead of forcing you to do it for soul ash/soul cinders

[1:20:46] Komatiq: Yes but none of them have the same appeal as wow has
[1:20:49] motorboatingpro: I think of the game as old as the legion expansion. That was the last big revamp of systems.
[1:20:50] chrslp: Age of Conan thought they were gonna take down WoW Kappa
[1:20:59] throwawaym3: alot of competition now
[1:21:11] Thunderbrew: Casuals pay for the game.

[1:21:39] gundamzeros01: @Towelliee nowdays pple got better pc , internet , and lots of games out there still Wow prevail
[1:21:40] markyboy19899: Wow is Wows Killer
[1:21:45] cameron3332: @Towelliee do you still play everquest? i miss the days of jeff kaplan raging on the forums
[1:21:46] superphunphap: i cant wait till they release wotlk retail and warmane loses all its playerbase
[1:21:47] givmeafrekinname: I wonder if they'll announce a new WoW on its 20th anniversary.
[1:21:47] kowaikoro: atleast bfa gave an reason to login sadge
[1:21:49] DoubleNova: every game has a season pass is a good example
[1:21:49] pixxelina: reset Azeroth, no mega villain expansion
[1:21:55] mmrghost7: the systems makes u to log out :D
[1:22:04] Thoreya: modernization is needed
[1:22:06] Kaihrn: Legion was the sweet spot
[1:22:09] Aquadriel: shadowland systems are too unrewarding and restrictive that make people not want to bother playing
[1:22:28] Aquadriel: it fucking is
[1:22:48] Aquadriel: they went from bfa too rewarding to sl not rewarding at all
[1:22:53] chrslp: I swear no one remembers how big of a flop Age of Conan was KEKW
[1:22:53] xxXGorbyXxx: the actual loot system ist one of the biggest fails
[1:23:00] cameron3332: everquest stream? @Towelliee PauseChamp
[1:23:00] stjon13: ya but just scrap the systems , just focus on tier sets and add content like dungs story quest's I'd be happy
[1:23:01] sifer007: just wait for dreamheaven for wow2 LUL
[1:23:04] Xsilentghost: classic wows success had a impact on shadowlands game design
[1:23:05] motorboatingpro: do you think we need more AP? something to farm?
[1:23:12] GrimNGhastly: the fact that raiding is better ilvl than mythic+ kinda effected people alot
[1:23:19] DreamWebb: lol who would ever ask for less loot
[1:23:20] WayneG947: need a switch up at the top and work their way down

[1:23:33] MarquisLek: i miss being able to get legendaries from random bs
[1:23:40] kowaikoro: blizzard needs an legion 2.0 badly
[1:23:54] geokouts: I think on last WoW expantion before curtain call will introduce player housing :P
[1:24:11] Malarick: Need to get Ion to understand we need to go from Make Loot mean Loot again to Make Loot Drop again
[1:24:11] thiccsushi: @Towelliee It's him finally coming to the stark realization thats what i got from it
[1:24:13] Sodbox: <3 makes sense Towellliee
[1:24:13] Broomba: Post was like what do I do I‚Äôm scared to quit wow.
[1:24:20] zooyep: if its a job its a job
[1:24:23] Aquadriel: i think he said that more in the sense of "keep playing but also raise your voice to demand changes". But i agree with you on it sounding a bit bipolar
[1:24:23] mmrghost7: i agree we need legion 2.0
[1:24:45] NerdyTeK: legion was pretty sick
[1:24:46] WayneG947: too much time and effort put into wow for him
[1:24:48] Zaidrel: If you‚Äôre talking about Asmon I don‚Äôt think his post was telling anyone to quit?
[1:24:50] zooyep: if you're not getting paid to play wow atm.. it would be kinda hard to justify playing imo
[1:24:52] throwawaym3: Is it still trendy to hate on WoW?
[1:25:00] Funderik: it's like he never took a break, went back to that same thing, same content
[1:25:01] Blas0n: @Towelliee I play this Exapnsion more then any other in my life and ive played this game since Vanilla i think SL is the best Exp
[1:25:07] DreamWebb: i reckon alot of the player base dont play other games and they only play wow so if its unpopular or bad they panick
[1:25:11] Blastbullx: true KEKW
[1:25:13] Sodbox: zac AKA asmongold? ;)
[1:25:14] Girm87: its more of a just chatting stream with wowon in the background
[1:25:20] thiccsushi: what makes shadowlands the best expansion for you? @Blas0n
[1:25:22] sc0t: Blizzard needs to rest WoW 3-4 years, then relaunch a new WoW universe game in a vastly different era. Use OW2 + Diablo 4 revenue to make up for it.
[1:25:29] mmrghost7: @Sodbox no zac from league of legends :P
[1:25:29] cameron3332: i finally quin during slands, first time dropping my sub in a decade Sadge
[1:25:31] Blas0n: @thiccsushi The raiding
[1:25:38] nisk___: he got Twitch Tenure
[1:25:40] WayneG947: i was excited for him to "play other things and change his channel" but more wow and my dick is clean jokes. Its exactly the same as before he took his last break
[1:25:45] dartanno: LUL
[1:25:47] pixxelina: LUL

[1:26:12] Tartxo: so true lol
[1:26:13] quakegoogl: towBook
[1:26:17] dalaraz: wow has the plus,on its downtime that a streamer can share opinions @Towelliee
[1:26:19] Broomba: He needs an intervention
[1:26:27] Girm87: the post feels like validation for my self at least with how i feel about the game
[1:26:32] Untalented: because it is
[1:26:37] Chuckforfun: he just need a girlfriend thats it ;D
[1:26:37] BabzInBowburn: The setup behind you is looking pretty sweet

[1:26:49] WayneG947: he needs another addiction to get off wow. hoping AoC might b it for him
[1:26:51] pixxelina: OH YEAH
[1:26:53] Thunderbrew: WoW is comfortable for me. I know the systems etc, I don't want to learn a new game
[1:26:55] throwawaym3: Im pumped for 9.1 tbh
[1:26:58] Kallomon: Zackmongold made the post?
[1:27:00] Girm87: we forgot about WoD :P
[1:27:00] Thoreya: if 9.1 didnt take 8 months to come out idt wed see near the negativity we see rn
[1:27:01] Sodbox: thoughts on asmongold @Towelliee?
[1:27:01] Effin_Steffin: WoW is Life.
[1:27:04] zeebo221: fuck i hate how right u are
[1:27:04] mmrghost7: i dont know about 9.1
[1:27:05] MarquisLek: the past only hurts while you're living it
[1:27:08] Fredster134: Problem is 9.1 isn't fixing much
[1:27:13] HigameR4771: LuvSign
[1:27:20] DreamWebb: sounds like a cult motto
[1:27:23] Gennzo: oh no LUL
[1:27:26] Thoreya: conduit energy isnt gonna make me quit the game lol
[1:27:28] ice_ross: players are gamers at patch launches, and game devs in droughts
[1:27:34] dianthusnemo: you are right :) even after a 5 year break - I came back
[1:27:38] Shaeli: that is as disgusting as its true.....
[1:27:39] lanara233: I wonder how his TBC Arena tournament went
[1:27:44] jerseyfive: cocain's a hell of a drug
[1:27:49] Xsilentghost: will there ever be a chance that asmongold could ever interview a wow dev?
[1:27:56] WayneG947: it will be back in 9.3 or whatever the last patch is  i never get baited by the middle pactches
[1:27:57] chrslp: The old Arena Tournaments used to be awesome
[1:28:01] dozilla: I don't think i'm coming back to WoW, after 15 years too. I'm 43 now, got a toddler to raise, don't have the time, I'd rather watch you @Towelliee

[1:28:48] Wadjaah: 77 days patches OpieOP
[1:28:50] nisk___: do you think we will get a 9.3
[1:29:05] Thoreya: 100%
[1:29:07] Thoreya: agreed
[1:29:10] Girm87: I wonder how this will affect when we see the expansion after SL
[1:29:12] Thoreya: taliesin said the same thing
[1:29:15] garkhyt: @Towelliee but if you will be ask about that environment.  Where will you do it?  Is Torghast the jailer domain, where it should happen?  Given all the scenario about Sylvanas happen in the same place?
[1:29:22] DreamWebb: SL is going to go down in history as WOD 2.0
[1:29:26] kowaikoro: i've leveled more alts in 9.0.5 then in 9.0 prepatch KEKW
[1:29:28] chrslp: 29% of subs gone last year but profits still up LUL
[1:29:37] ice_ross: new content is a hellova drug
[1:29:46] Thoreya: 29% over 3 years
[1:29:54] chrslp: Oh, still LUL
[1:29:56] beachcomba: do you think 9.2 will introduce f2p and a battlepass?
[1:29:56] nisk___: We are going to SUPER_TORGHAST after
[1:30:04] Blastbullx: its only the first layer if torghast raid
[1:30:06] Blastbullx: 7 more after
[1:30:10] garkhyt: Understood
[1:30:13] Thoreya: the raid looks good tho
[1:30:15] Siglius: Those 29% were from Activision Blizzard overall. Not from WoW.
[1:30:22] onyx_pupper: new arthas raid would be cool
[1:30:22] Thoreya: like aside from the fact that its torghast
[1:30:25] TealJelly7: @chrslp Not subs, but players from their entire player base from every game
[1:30:25] Siglius: WoW is actually doing soilid.
[1:30:28] Mabusa: plot twist, this will be last patch in expansion
[1:30:38] chrslp: As much as I hate to say it, WoW will never be as popular as it once was
[1:30:45] Funderik: that raid is all down to the sylvanas fight tbh, i hope it's insane with some cool shit ontop of torghast
[1:30:46] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Torghast is like Magni, it never leaves LOL
[1:30:51] Siglius: Overwatch, HoTs and Diablo are where those 30% comes from.
[1:30:56] Thoreya: because in 2007 there wasnt netflix or fortnite
[1:31:08] Sodbox: @Towelliee YES DUDE
[1:31:18] Sodbox: @Towelliee he shits on WoW all the time and it made him haha
[1:31:20] ElStaffo: Asmongold is my spirit animal

[1:31:46] chrslp: Back in BC shit was popping all the way through till Wotlk
[1:32:05] zooyep: wait what? his point was at a time when people are all inside.. they lost market
[1:32:08] sc0t: Asmongold doesn't have Blizzard's metrics. That 29% could be zombie accounts people have paid but not played for months, etc. It is _NO MEASURE_ of player engagement.
[1:32:10] DoubleNova: crazy that it's been 15 months
[1:32:17] dr__mantis_toboggan_md: yeah overwatch has to be the biggest contributor to that
[1:32:26] Thoreya: but BC was in 2007 where there was like no other games on the market..wow was a great game but didnt have much competitors back then
[1:32:32] belfastcl: which blizz game has the biggest population?
[1:32:36] Funderik: i don't get the mindset of acting like only blizzard games lost players lol i bet 10000 games lost player count
[1:32:45] pavepawns: we talking cod too?
[1:33:07] GrimNGhastly: hearthstone @belfastcl
[1:33:11] Aquadriel: yep
[1:33:15] mab_music_ttrpg: pretty sure a lot of people stopped playing but are still subb anyway XD But it shows that less people are playing when you try to pug anything.
[1:33:15] AelyzZ: Is it possible that you are the only steamer not crying about delux edition?
[1:33:15] Thunderbrew: How are other games/companies doing during that period of time?
[1:33:16] Sodbox: @Towelliee I love you right now haha

[1:33:47] chrslp: Call of Duty is Blizz game too LUL
[1:33:49] justlnquisitive: I mean, like you said, the game is old af. It's getting to be like a TV show that runs too long and then everyone ends up hating it.
[1:33:52] pixxelina: and just blurting out blizz "data" is so careless of him
[1:34:04] WayneG947: the only blizz game i play now is OW
[1:34:10] Cinzano_Bianco: wow only 1 with subs though
[1:34:11] TealJelly7: Their numbers are actually up
[1:34:17] Sodbox: @Towelliee joining OTK when?

[1:35:05] Noshpan: Like the SImpsons
[1:35:06] Aquadriel: they cant affor a maid to clean asmon's room, you think they can afford Towelman? LUL
[1:35:06] WayneG947: u should RP with Esfand hahaha
[1:35:07] Noshpan: ;p;
[1:35:19] DoubleNova: where did Doge end up at?
[1:35:25] smating: Good bot moobot answering question that i had @Towelliee
[1:35:27] pixxelina: not even sure what OTK does tbh, what their objective is
[1:35:27] Snacktooth: imagine being born in boston in 1996, all you've known i winning. Must be strange for them now lol
[1:35:29] ice_ross: fucking ion brady
[1:35:36] PokerFaceMoose: do the est side of badlands for mithril
[1:35:41] Gizimoo86: i am at badlands mining its pretty good
[1:35:44] dalaraz: some parts of badlands are good,south west and far east
[1:35:58] Aquadriel: wasnt ungoro good for mithril? or it was thorium?
[1:35:59] primetimezhilex: @Towelliee  why dont go in Blastedlands entrance left cave - near ally base
[1:36:00] dalaraz: the cave south east is good for mithril @Towelliee
[1:36:00] chrslp: It went down to 0.40
[1:36:13] Texspc: Doge is not going away, its here for the long term
[1:36:14] mab_music_ttrpg: AMC to the moon
[1:36:20] chrslp: 0.40 just means discount doge
[1:36:37] zooyep: yea thats how it works.. buy the rumor sell the news
[1:36:37] CardinalTX: gotta love made up currency
[1:36:37] DoubleNova: the whole thing is hilarious
[1:36:39] Thunderbrew: Saturday Night Live?
[1:36:48] General_SushiBuns: only bad part about badlands is that its known to be good so might be more competition for myth
[1:36:53] PokerFaceMoose: it hit 70 cents and i think a ton of people had sell orders because it dropped 10 cents in like a minute
[1:36:55] VladVolynine: @Tacoma64 that's literally all currency in the history of mankind LUL
[1:36:56] onyx_pupper: i jusst dont like doge cause it cant be capped
[1:37:07] Gravity16: @towelliee hey my guy, how casual friendly is tbc once 70 is hit?
[1:37:10] Gizimoo86: yeah ores are good for jewlelcrafting prospecting
[1:37:12] GetTasty_: true silver is 230
[1:37:12] chrslp: I'm still waiting for GME to go to the moon quackBlank
[1:37:14] dalaraz: truesilver is 230
[1:37:25] zooyep: yea doge isnt designed to moon from here
[1:37:28] primetimezhilex: Im mining from work ^^ :D
[1:37:41] dalaraz: you can alwys buy abd smelt some gold ores @Towelliee
[1:37:44] TealJelly7: Most people want a new MMO that's going to recreate the old WoW feeling but it's hard to happen because these people are also much older now so it's hard to experience the same feeling. The MMO genre needs to recreate the same feeling for the younger generation, not to appeal to the old MMO players.
[1:37:47] SpratsTV: the whole space x stuff will bring alot of attention to doge be interesting to see how it affects the price
[1:37:49] GetTasty_: un goro has it but un goro has thorium
[1:37:53] GetTasty_: mainly
[1:38:01] Thoreya: LUL
[1:38:12] Thoreya: asmon said wow waste our time now...as if wow ever not wasted our time???
[1:38:15] chrslp: Dailies and rep grinds and attunements LUL
[1:38:25] sc0t: the attunements in TBCC will make people WISH they were doing Ony attune again
[1:38:25] Wadjaah: Past the attunements you're pretty much on a cruise pace

[1:38:35] Thunderbrew: Which tank will be easiest to play in TBC Classic?
[1:38:36] primetimezhilex: i have mined in Hinterlants and it was good skill,  just circle around.
[1:38:43] Crazyjuniot: is it normal now to have Trojan ads on the twitch app?
[1:38:53] TealJelly7: @ice_ross I will start with most people because it's a fact that most people that play WoW are 25+ years old
[1:39:04] Baron_Pandacula: @Thoreya thats not what he said, he said "wow used to be a game that made us want to waste our time now it just wastes our time"
[1:39:09] khallfrodo: khallfrodo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:39:10] ice_ross: @Peepolandian source?
[1:39:11] mintcookie_vajankle: BT attunement is tedious
[1:39:12] sc0t: @Thunderbrew Druid is "easiest", Paladin is best for trash, Warrior is still king for raid bosses due to Last Stand + Shield Wall
[1:39:12] Xavorcs: shattered halls?
[1:39:12] kerberw: shattered halls key
[1:39:12] kofifrog: ye you need it to enter shattered halls
[1:39:12] Wadjaah: It's to forge the shattered hall key for the entrance
[1:39:16] General_SushiBuns: attunements are only a pain when people in your group are too lazy to do them ahead of time lol
[1:39:26] chrslp: Attunements in Classic are def harder than TBC. TBC attunements are pretty much run dungeons or grind rep
[1:39:27] Grandzfer: Fel Reaver is for Shattered Halls
[1:39:40] TealJelly7: @ice_ross There have been plenty of sources, google it. Also, you don't need to be an expert to know that.
[1:39:46] Thunderbrew: @sc0t My group of friends needs a tank for leveling. I'll play a Druid Tank
[1:39:48] chrslp: TBC takes longer but straightforward
[1:39:50] flebbooo: I can't wait to aoe tank as a prot pally, it gna be juicy gachiHYPER
[1:40:10] quakegoogl: draRage PopCorn

[1:42:06] r0b928: Will I still be able to play wow classic once TBC comes out?
[1:42:09] flebbooo: nope
[1:42:35] sc0t: @George2001k Yes, because Bobby Kotick needs a new Gulfstream G700, he's embarassed to be seen in the G5 at the airfield
[1:42:37] thiccsushi: Just pay $35 4Head
[1:42:47] mwsoldier: a small fee of $35 perhaps? Kappa
[1:42:47] Funderik: u can play classic, you get to pick, if you want both, you pay
[1:42:49] Baron_Pandacula: @r0b928 yesnt
[1:42:49] givmeafrekinname: per charactr LUL
[1:42:51] dalaraz: depends,if you need to play both with the same char you need to pay,otherwise its free
[1:42:52] Shaeli: only costs if you want to play 1 char on both classic and tbc..
[1:42:52] givmeafrekinname: character*
[1:42:54] chrslp: Its not going to have dungeon teleports, right? Still need to be summoned or travel?
[1:42:55] Lasidor: So Im hearing Enhance is silly in BC, but man I dont remember them back in the day lol.  I was considering rolling one for the lawls but I guess its not a lawl.
[1:43:01] theoriginalzinng: you can stay in classic for free, or move to tbc for free... it only costs $ if you want to do botch
[1:43:03] theoriginalzinng: both
[1:43:26] gooni_coyg: just stay in classic for free
[1:43:27] idenkaz_: lmao
[1:43:36] Alexkayzz: maybe they meant cents instead of dollars when they set the 35 price
[1:43:38] WayneG947: pay for what?
[1:43:43] George2001k: @sc0t lol, I haven‚Äôt played the new Classic a d won‚Äôt play Burning crusade but I would play Wrath.
[1:43:44] WayneG947: mustve missed something
[1:43:50] General_SushiBuns: isnt it so that you can coppy your character and play the same toon on both tbc and classic  or am i remembering wrong?
[1:43:50] Baron_Pandacula: @r0b928 if you want to play your old character in classic and tbc you cant, but you can make a character for classic
[1:43:51] theoriginalzinng: i just dont get why you would want to do both tbh
[1:43:55] Thunderbrew: Meetings Stones are now Summoning stones?
[1:43:59] byrdeen45: so you have to pay for tbc
[1:44:00] DreamWebb: LOL no they wont they are laughing all the way to the bank with deluxe ed + character copy services
[1:44:09] dalaraz: @Thunderbrew yeah
[1:44:11] idenkaz_: @byrdeen45 no just for the copy of you character
[1:44:14] chrslp: Best change will be not needing a lock to summon to dungeons LUL
[1:44:17] Isshy_Wondertwin: Do summoning stones become available in prepatch?
[1:44:18] byrdeen45: oh ok
[1:44:19] belfastcl: @theoriginalzinng some people like vanillla and hate tbc
[1:44:34] Zubberikan: $35 per character by the way. That's an important distinction
[1:44:37] chrslp: @isshy_wondertwin I dont think thats till TBC
[1:44:42] dalaraz: @belfastcl they can stay in classic for free :) everyone will b ehappy
[1:44:43] UhhNadda: thats exactly what it is
[1:44:44] WayneG947: oh so u cant choose tbc and level a new character?,
[1:44:45] Polebegood: they prob do
[1:44:46] elvia_: yeah 5 or 10 dollars max for the data and servers cost thats all
[1:45:04] Lasidor: 35 dollars is such a STEEP price too, like I wouldnt agree with them if it was 10 dollars, but damn man 35?
[1:45:05] Baron_Pandacula: if they want to kill classic, could they atleast make retail more enjoyable please
[1:45:06] gooni_coyg: well in the old days u could not have an only classic realm
[1:45:07] UhhNadda: yeah theyre P6 servers right ?
[1:45:24] BTFO_rules: to get the key to shattered halls you needed to kill a named guy buy the black temple to get the quest chain to kill fell reaver
[1:45:27] TheNightCook: that actually kinda makes sense that they wanna kill classic. they stated before they didn't want to run 2 MMOs, you think they want to run 3?
[1:45:31] deathrider606: deluxe edition i think is worth it
[1:45:35] Eikus11: @wayneg552 current classic servers will turn into TBC servers
[1:45:35] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:45:35] StoicTaurus: Well.. retail realm transfer cost $20 ... and no option to leave "copy" behind
[1:46:13] Lasidor: Curious though, wahts the point of staying in Classic? Just because? I feel like its going to slowly die out either way.
[1:46:18] Thunderbrew: Once TBC Pre Patch drops will leveling be faster?
[1:46:21] Sincline387: it's literally a different server
[1:46:24] dalaraz: classic people will be moved to new servers or something ?
[1:46:26] WayneG947: ah so i would have to level a new character in classic and my 60s will go to tbc
[1:46:30] elvia_: i dont think people want to do naxx for ever
[1:46:35] ydinvoima: Wonder if we are going to get wotlk severs in 2022 or 23?
[1:46:36] Manferno: @thunderbrew little bit yeah
[1:46:38] BTFO_rules: @Towelliee  to get the key to shattered halls you needed to kill a named guy buy the black temple to get the quest chain to kill fell reaver
[1:46:44] dalaraz: @Thunderbrew generally yeah but only between 20-60
[1:46:52] Wadjaah: Classic era will have their own servers version that will be connected between them like retail
[1:46:59] dalaraz: @ydinvoima definitely
[1:46:59] belfastcl: it will be like a private server at the end of it's cycle, bunch of people waiting for fresh
[1:47:02] Aquadriel: and in 10 years people gonna ask classic classic
[1:47:02] KingofMeccano: well its gonna be a good day in the uk next monday tbc for wow and less covid restrictions :D
[1:47:08] Gravity16: Wonder if it‚Äôs going to create naming headaches - if you choose to leave your character permanent classic will his name be available on tbc
[1:47:12] sc0t: There are people who got into Naxxramas late, and are still pushing for their Kel'Thuzad kill.  There's several guilds on my server (Mankrik) in this category.
[1:47:22] mwsoldier: I don't really understand staying in classic, isn't everyone going to be stagnant in tier 3 at a certain point?
[1:47:23] sc0t: they're probably going to Clone their mains.
[1:47:29] JCAnderson1983: lol merging.  They will just make people pay a transfer fee on top of the $35 fee
[1:47:37] quakegoogl: iamforCake
[1:47:44] Xavorcs: honestly it'd be more like vanilla if server pops were much lower
[1:47:45] Magdelia: Magdelia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! hottub stream when?
[1:48:02] pavepawns: is it called progressing when you got him on farm
[1:48:05] pavepawns: :o
[1:48:10] onyx_pupper: they should pull a runescape move adn jsut start making new content
[1:48:48] Xsilentghost: what character does Ion play in mythic raiding?
[1:48:51] Xavorcs: $70 for the deluxe, really>?
[1:48:51] jeneraljelly: I woulda done $20 to char copy
[1:48:54] deathrider606: hell ya
[1:48:59] Xavorcs: that's nuts
[1:49:00] gooni_coyg: I take the deluxe edition :D
[1:49:01] jeneraljelly: $35 is gross
[1:49:01] DreamWebb: yeah classic will die unless there is progression servers like EQ or new fresh servers are spun up
[1:49:20] TealJelly7: And it's per character which is the worst part LUL
[1:49:24] onyx_pupper: probably cause they know people are willing to pay
[1:49:27] WayneG947: that 35 is the Activision part of Activision/Blizzard lol
[1:49:35] Blas0n: @Xsilentghost VEnthyr RSham
[1:49:44] Zubberikan: @Towelliee deluxe edition being more expensive than a fully released brand new AAA game? How is that worth? The game is 14 years old.
[1:49:46] dalaraz: i think they did it so people dont do it eventually @Towelliee
[1:49:50] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: Dont the classic comunity want to play tbc ?
[1:50:03] sc0t: Blizzard should offer a Classic+ option, with changes players have been asking for at least 16 years. Fix Shaman Tanking. Give Tauren the Totem weapons Kevin Jordan said were abandoned. -  ..
[1:50:09] Manferno: @adicted_hydra_spammer for the most part
[1:50:12] quakegoogl: towVACBOSS
[1:50:14] sharkie0123: change classic to seasonal i.e. full reset once a year
[1:50:22] dalaraz: i dontthink blizzard wants people to stay in classic,thats why the high price @Towelliee
[1:50:41] pavepawns: deluxe edition is only additions like cosmetic and boost. tbc is free and people are morons for not fckin reading this stuff
[1:50:45] elvia_: i dont know why you dont have the clone in the deluxe
[1:50:51] gooni_coyg: I dont get why ppl are angry on the deluxe edition. Dont buy it then. It is pure cosmetic
[1:50:52] Sodbox: sumWiener @Towelliee speaks the truth
[1:50:55] Zubberikan: It's $70 for cosmetics. You can get hours and hours for a full game with brand new content. They want more for cosmetics?!
[1:50:55] geokouts: 12.99 EU :P
[1:50:56] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: PogChamp
[1:51:09] Baron_Pandacula: i just hope the 100% movement speed mount is only on datamining, because 100% movement speed at lvl 40 is an unfair advantage
[1:51:11] bruhSit_farmer: they named it the "Dark portal Pass"
[1:51:15] DreamWebb: @Gooners free mount is not cosmetic
[1:51:15] bruhSit_farmer: fuckers
[1:51:23] protonicawow: fack the extras fack burning crusade why shall i pay to copy my classic char , more money for blizz? no ty
[1:51:27] idenkaz_: glad i quit at the right time and can escape this shitshow.
[1:51:27] yunitoYuniro: It‚Äôs mainly for the whales
[1:51:31] geokouts: to be fair it is OPTIONAl
[1:51:38] zNzUV: it doest affect? are you crazy?
[1:51:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:51:39] quakegoogl: towGold EnlightenD
[1:51:46] gooni_coyg: Do u do more dps with ur mount. No - good it is cosmetic
[1:51:47] TealJelly7: it affects some gameplay when you have a boosted person in your dungeon group who doesn't know how the game works
[1:51:49] tigzie: what about Trout?
[1:51:51] Greencaps07: its 2 toys 2 mounts and 30 days game time right ?
[1:51:54] justlnquisitive: monkaS sharks
[1:51:55] gooni_coyg: U will have a mount anyway with ur boost
[1:51:55] onyx_pupper: im just waiting for the wow gatcha game
[1:51:58] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: 70 bucks OMEGALUL thats to much    for a bundle in a  game that you  allready pay to play it
[1:52:03] bruhSit_farmer: guys ive got a joke, knock knock ...
[1:52:09] Sincline387: Free mount is 100% cosmetic as it scales to your level of riding it's not a 100% mount for free
[1:52:11] WayneG947: @magemyway Same man, my sub expired 4 months ago, not planning on renewing anytime soon
[1:52:14] geokouts: check the bird it was maybe a rare
[1:52:14] SpratsTV: @Greencaps07 and 58 boost
[1:52:16] PrisheBurningBlade: but im an entilted zoomer fornite player I want it all for free, cuz my mommy didnt know how to discipline me as a child
[1:52:18] Lasidor: BeCaUsE YoUr MoUnT iS So CoOL
[1:52:23] alibynx: @Towelliee just wanted to say your RE: Village stream was amazing LOL a lot of laughs and was well played, did we figure out how the guy was able to attach his hand with the alcohol fluid LUL
[1:52:25] flebbooo: LUL
[1:52:28] bruhSit_farmer: KNOCK KNOCK ...
[1:52:29] TMMOOF: @PrisheBurningBlade KEKW
[1:52:34] dalaraz: it can affect the economy though
[1:52:37] geokouts: None is forcing you to get the Collection
[1:52:41] Xavorcs: @ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER LUL
[1:52:45] Sodbox: pls dont have more mounts then me towelliee, how dare you >:(
[1:52:49] Biscuitcapes: A warpstalker that has 100% mount speed at level 40...
[1:52:53] jeneraljelly: the economy is in shambles
[1:52:54] Vladodumbus15: @Towelliee it MAY technically affect you in a very specific way. You level/do dungeons and his presence may have helped , but the chances are minuscule
[1:52:56] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: chinese   bots monkaS
[1:52:57] Lasidor: "Think of the economy" Is the new "think of the children" shit lol
[1:52:57] Baron_Pandacula: a new player creating a lvl 58 hunter and getting into a dungeon does affect someones gameplay by them not knowing what they are doing much like a hunter
[1:53:00] sc0t: Y'all have fun on your store mounts, I'll still be one of 10 guys on the server with a Turbo-Charged Flying Machine
[1:53:03] Thoreya: But think about the economy!!
[1:53:05] pavepawns: lets be honest the ''economy'' is people with over 20k
[1:53:08] Dembar: Some wil say it enables bots even more and that will influence them/you/us.
[1:53:11] pavepawns: and theres alot of them
[1:53:12] Eikus11: @Biscuitcapes no it does not, there was a blue post
[1:53:14] Rexy95: @Biscuitcapes wrong
[1:53:14] dalaraz: those people is another problem blizzard didnt solve @Towelliee
[1:53:17] WayneG947: the economy is gonna br inflatated about 3000% on release
[1:53:19] Sodbox: lol yeah classic economy is nothing like vanilla
[1:53:21] alejandrogonor: For 100% speed, you need the epic equitation, Blizzars talks about that today
[1:53:21] Sodbox: imo
[1:53:21] twanlol: man I wish there was tbc fresh, the economy is so fked moving into TBC
[1:53:29] zNzUV: it affects the number of people in max level it affects the number of max level class, the economy, the leveling areas .. every aspect of the game changes based on that f boost

[1:53:32] Wadjaah: Bots don't need boost to perform LUL
[1:53:32] FresheFefe: Pls towel let me complain Kappa
[1:53:38] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: @ItsPetahhhh  eventually they  will learn the players that  are good they will already be ahead and not meet a newbie  in a dungeon trust me
[1:53:41] Zubberikan: @Towelliee It's not about affect on other players. It's an absurd price for a mount that doesn't fly and in turn is semi-irrelevant in TBC endgame. A hearthstone cosmetic that you'll see at max once an hour and other stupid cosmetics + boost. Definitely not worth $70 - even $50 would be pushing it.
[1:53:42] dalaraz: those rich people is why people want fresh bc servers @Towelliee
[1:53:45] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @hjo1992 (warning)
[1:53:46] Sodbox: Towelliee used Glider confirmed? ;) jk
[1:53:59] trancenation5: @pavepawns  20k is nothing on eu , half the server has atleast 1 gold cap
[1:54:06] Dembar: I agree, was just playing devils advocat.
[1:54:06] DreamWebb: im not sure how they are going to combat the gold stacking before the character copy everyone is gonna be fuking rich
[1:54:12] pavepawns: @trancenation5 ye i know i meant more poor ppl
[1:54:15] Dorky1495: @zNzUV someone who boosts the 58, prolly has no idea about half of those things, let alone has gold to ruin the economy, or knows how to farm to get gold
[1:54:20] pavepawns: cause 20k is poor on classic
[1:54:24] idenkaz_: gaslighting it does good work for creators. content views ect but they know it hurts the game.
[1:54:28] pavepawns: my buddy has 3 chars with over 20k
[1:54:28] Exusprime: Wait what there's Naxx geared GDKP bots, thats terrifying
[1:54:29] SpratsTV: dont think the 58 is that big a deal if the 100% mount at level 40 is true thats quite a big deal
[1:54:32] trancenation5: @pavepawns  i have 100g kekw

[1:54:36] bruhSit_farmer: we're talking about how shadowlands is bad
[1:54:37] Wildside1177: Parallels the real world. So many people jealous of those who have worked hard and amassed a fortune while they smoked weed.
[1:54:40] Aquadriel: i dont KEKW
[1:54:44] belfastcl: wasnt the boost so new players could join their friends
[1:54:47] Whitemamba236: do you have to be 60 to buy the boost?
[1:54:51] Baron_Pandacula: @Towelliee what do you think about the rumors of the warp stalker mount having 100% move speed at lvl 40
[1:54:52] Dorky1495: @Sprats_UK that was confirmed, the mount scales, so 40 gets 60 mount, lvl 60 gets 100 mount
[1:54:58] TMMOOF: Personally. I didnt play classic that much when it launched. Now I'm behind going into tbc. As a vanilla wow player, I appreciate the boost
[1:55:00] nickysicky19: What if blizzard comes out with a classic wow token ?
[1:55:06] Eikus11: @Whitemamba236 nope
[1:55:07] SpratsTV: @Dorky1495 oh decent then fine with that
[1:55:13] Zubberikan: @Wildside1177 Dunno what world you're in. Hard work doesn't mean you'll get a fortune anymore. But you do you.
[1:55:15] pavepawns: @Sprats_UK it was confirmed its not 100% at 40 it was written as such cause its a scaling mount. meaning it scales on your current riding lvl
[1:55:17] TealJelly7: Not all of them. Some people come back for the game only because of TBC, and the boost makes them skip the base game which shouldn't happen.
[1:55:18] Manferno: @itspetahhhh it doesn't
[1:55:20] kronnnotv: chat being chat again....
[1:55:21] dalaraz: they can have tbc professions
[1:55:31] Dorky1495: U can be lvl 0 to boost, just make a new character lol
[1:55:35] idenkaz_: you have to have one 60 character tho. lmao
[1:55:44] Aquadriel: fuck i am 1 sadge
[1:55:53] Aro725: @ItsPetahhhh theres literally a blue post that says its 60 percent until you buy epic speed then goes to 100
[1:56:01] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: the lvl boost is nice for a newbie like me :)
[1:56:04] bruhSit_farmer: yo towel knock knock
[1:56:05] Dorky1495: shit a free lvl 60 without having to lvl 1 - 60... HELL YEAH
[1:56:06] Dorky1495: KEKW
[1:56:07] Eikus11: @magemyway too boost? no you dont
[1:56:12] Dorky1495: ima end up buying it anyway
[1:56:23] bruhSit_farmer: 9.1
[1:56:26] idenkaz_: @Ikeadin that not what i said? who are you
[1:56:28] dalaraz: @magemyway no you dont need to
[1:56:28] gooni_coyg: Ppl dont read blue post anymore. They only rant!
[1:56:31] pavepawns: i mean classic is trash so easily understandable why ppl wanna skip the lvling
[1:56:32] Omegacloud: Boosts = more Bots = Economy? KEKW
[1:56:33] Aedarax: KEKW
[1:56:34] zNzUV: but tell me @Towelliee why use the argument that is for people that wanna play with their friends so only 1 boost peer account,still if you already have a char lvl 58 you can buy it anyway
[1:56:34] Kaihrn: i mean any new player that uses the boost is gona be lost with muscle memory and ability use for ages anyway haha
[1:56:41] WayneG947: Go mum, GJ netting Towelliee
[1:56:45] Arsonx: You can open a new account and boost the very first toon you make. @magemyway
[1:56:54] Camtully: WutFace
[1:56:56] Noshpan: Part of me wants to level BE Hunter for TBC Classic, but then I remember ammo & pet happiness.
[1:57:00] Sodbox: do we know the cloning restrictions? I'm just wondering because the people who will be cloning will have tons of epics to sell in classic/mats and then the same for TBC
[1:57:01] sifer007: Darkportal pass LUL
[1:57:03] tadekildzen: Will boosts work on belf and draenei? 2020Suspicious
[1:57:04] Eikus11: @magemyway a bot, so shhh
[1:57:12] SpratsTV: @tadekildzen nope
[1:57:17] Wildside1177: @Zubberikan Of course not. Not for everyone. But for those who make excellent decisions and work hard, they are successful. The idea that it is not possible at all is just victimhood ideology.
[1:57:18] zNzUV: people are literaly payin to skip the game and thats just ridiculous tbh
[1:57:19] bruhSit_farmer: towelliee is my dad ?? wow no wonder i cant stop talking
[1:57:27] Guurag: If uo say the price is so insanely high , just don't buy it xd yes its high but there is no reason to buy it , they set the price so high cous they know people will buy it anyways
[1:57:37] Baron_Pandacula: dark portal pass, next tier wow battle pass kek
[1:57:38] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: true
[1:57:39] GetTasty_: @zNzUV you are obviously an elitist stfu
[1:57:43] General_SushiBuns: smart marketing with that name lmao
[1:57:44] pavepawns: @zNzUV its not skipping when they are boosting to the content they are wanting to play
[1:57:57] Dorky1495: @Towelliee i feel some of the "confusion" is because its named "Dark Portal Pass" doesnt that name just seem to portray that you will have to buy it to go to TBC?
[1:57:58] zNzUV: how is it fine dude the leveling is part of the burning crusade :s
[1:58:06] deathrider606: your the best man soo true
[1:58:08] Broomba: @zNzUV wtf is that logic?
[1:58:12] bruhSit_farmer: TBC = BBC
[1:58:13] dalaraz: @zNzUV yes and no
[1:58:18] Wadjaah: LUL
[1:58:33] Dorky1495: I actually kinda gave up on a shammy, 2 weeks is a bit rough tbh
[1:58:33] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: true true  people actually want to play the game :)
[1:58:34] Eikus11: @zNzUV followed 13min ago....go fish else where haha
[1:58:42] GetTasty_: my man is tight because he grinded to lvl 60 the hard way and others get the short route LMAO
[1:58:43] mussor23: that's whats the prepatch is for?
[1:58:45] quakegoogl: rphGhost
[1:58:47] aLargeBoke: im boosting to ruin my life, not the economy
[1:58:48] jrich10: I'm one of those 1000s
[1:58:50] gandalfsbeard24: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:58:56] Exusprime: Sorry am i understanding that its changed, you dont need to have a 60 for boost anymore?
[1:58:56] quakegoogl: ruyuF ruyuLurk
[1:59:01] LiteralZero: @aynulphister LUL
[1:59:01] jeneraljelly: People are gonna quit in TBC too probably, should be interesting
[1:59:02] gotbannedforgoldbuying: @Dorky1495 30% more xp
[1:59:07] Baron_Pandacula: i have an issue with that, since one of the things that make wow worse is that blizzard only sees the max level as the game, when the entire game should be relevant which boosting murders
[1:59:07] ydinvoima: Im going to boost a warrior to play with my friends on launch
[1:59:08] pepedeeee: Blizzard made leveling into a game
[1:59:09] DreamWebb: why fucking play classic then LUL
[1:59:18] dalaraz: @Exusprime theres wasnt that part there,ever
[1:59:18] pixxelina: exactly
[1:59:19] Dorky1495: @knorlak_ someone did the math, its still pretty rough
[1:59:21] ADICTED_HYDRA_SPAMMER: 1 month for lvl 60 Sadge
[1:59:22] Gizimoo86: thank god prepatch is faster
[1:59:23] zNzUV: its the magic of this fucking classic experience the time you invest in leveling teachs you the class and creats a connection with ur character.. the boost will just burn out the game faster
[1:59:24] sc0t: Warrior leveling.  *SHUDDER*
[1:59:25] Affiiance: Affiiance subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[1:59:26] twanlol: tbh no hate but IMO if you hate leveling and dont have time or want to grind, its not worth playing classic
[1:59:28] bruhSit_farmer: why play shadowlands if you can jump off a cliff
[1:59:28] kabel326: but it was really good that way too
[1:59:29] RenaShirow: truuuuth
[1:59:32] igor93: @Towelliee it will never happened but i wish they would give a 100% XP boost to BE and Dranei LUL
[1:59:40] BlackJAC__: im glad i like playing other game lol...this emotional attachment is tiring

[2:00:07] Manferno: it's not magic any more after 15 years
[2:00:07] SnakeFiveOh: Nobody that leveled during vanilla really LIKES the leveling magic lmao
[2:00:08] FresheFefe: b-b-but the magic LUL
[2:00:11] CardinalTX: Truth is a lot of people have more spare money than spare time.   Smart move Blizz
[2:00:11] zNzUV: i say disable the boost if the account has a lvl 60 already
[2:00:16] Aktz_: ThE lEvLiNg ExPeRiEnCe
[2:00:18] pepedeeee: i just wanna go back to 2004
[2:00:20] jrich10: if they never released wow classic. and went to tbc. you would be level 58 to start lol
[2:00:21] bruhSit_farmer: 2021 is depressing, shadowlands ect ect ....
[2:00:21] RolexKT: I'm level 32 in classic and grinding right now to be able to play with my friends who want to play with me. This shit takes forever and I would fucking gladly pay for the boost if I could.
[2:00:22] pavepawns: @ItsPetahhhh its not just blizzard that sees it that way... its the way people also feel. why do you think people even asked for boosts originally? noone wants to have to lvl 60 lvls to get to join their friends on a new class
[2:00:22] quakegoogl: towRage

[2:00:32] TMMOOF: Wanna clap those alliance cheeks for my talbuk
[2:00:33] gabbagoombah: People should just worry about their own fun and stop trying to control others when it doesn't affect them.
[2:00:33] onyx_pupper: my whole thing is it literally doesnt affect other players so why even complain about it
[2:00:34] zNzUV: THAN DISABLE THE BOOST FOR ACCOUNTS WITH MAX LVL TOONS LOL
[2:00:35] dalaraz: @zNzUV you can too much bout staff that doesnt matter
[2:00:37] gooni_coyg: Ppl need to relize that they are not young anymore. U CANT BRING THAT BACK
[2:00:41] bruhSit_farmer: id rather stick my dick in a blender than play SL
[2:00:43] tadekildzen: Will you only need a sub to play tbc?
[2:00:44] Zubberikan: @Wildside1177 if wealth came from hard work, then african mothers and sweat shop workers would be the 1%.

[2:00:52] Sgt_Winters: just dungeon over and over again. its boring but its fast
[2:00:59] Baron_Pandacula: @pavepawns who the fuck ever asked blizzard for boosts
[2:01:12] Wildside1177: I know 3 people that are returning to WoW for the first time in 10 years because of the boost. They would NEVER go through classic leveling again.
[2:01:23] mussor23: they had the gold before they could 100% mount xD
[2:01:24] Dustinstv: its the "i used to walk uphill both ways in the snow" arguement
[2:01:27] pavepawns: @ItsPetahhhh many people did during wod/legion cause the lvling felt like it took forever. it was even asked to devs multiple times
[2:01:30] tadekildzen: Will I only need a sub to play tbc guys?
[2:01:34] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Welp, my boss just asked me to work from 1pm-5pm next week because one of my coworkers just quit.

[2:01:43] TODDMANFLEX: 68 boost and heirloom lich king pass Pog
[2:01:44] onyx_pupper: @tadekildzen yea just sub
[2:01:44] Noshpan: @Towelliee I started playing WoW 3 weeks after TBC launched. I honestly don't mind if newcomers experience TBC with some QOL features.
[2:01:54] jrich10: @tadekildzen yes only need sub
[2:01:56] Eikus11: @podden no
[2:02:03] zNzUV: the game is a "perfect" recreation of the game at the time with the release of content in patchs etc and than you put a boost system that didnt existed its ridiculous
[2:02:03] throwawaym3: "BUT STORE MOUNTS KILLED WOW!!!!"
[2:02:03] Dimitrios90: @TODDMANFLEX  Frozen Throne Pass Kappa

[2:02:27] Brickcave_19: Saying this now, if Blizzard hadn't partnered with Activision then this boost wouldn't exist. This screams cash grab by Activision
[2:02:34] Arsonx: Are dk in TBC?
[2:02:35] Sincline387: I'd be ok with not having the boost if they nerf all other forms of boosting so you really have to experience the "MAGIC" of leveling when no one else is and you have to beg and beg for help anytime a group quest comes up

[2:06:39] SnakeFiveOh: I still dont know wtf AQ stands for
[2:06:43] zskeech: @Sodbox go warmane and try to compete
[2:06:45] Walshey: @Towelliee how long do you think it will take you to lvl to 60 on paladin?

[2:08:04] flebbooo: KEKW
[2:08:05] dalaraz: i think asmon not streaming is attracting a weird audience today
[2:08:07] Grandzfer: My wife and I started at launch, I tanked and she healed.  Best way to be humbled when your wife lets you run ahead and die,  then laughs at you.  And yes, those who didn't exp vanilla with all the bugs, the talent resets, and que times, have no idea how devoted those of us were that pushed through it.
[2:08:10] Sodbox: @zNzUV you're the problem

[2:11:46] ShadoodHD: im sorry, 75% of your biweekly salary for an alpha

[2:12:24] raTexBG: fuck off
[2:12:27] zskeech: you think getting the alpha given is worse than paying $400??
[2:12:32] ShadoodHD: screw it im getting my PopCorn brb
[2:12:42] zuvic: Ashes of creation will eat all of the MMOs. It's so amazing

[2:12:57] eyogbe: Ashes looks scuffed
[2:12:59] DreamWebb: non ethical game devs? tell me more CoolStoryBob
[2:13:06] onyx_pupper: wouldve been better to charge like 50$ with limited spots to not overload servers
[2:13:08] zuvic: CEO promised big things
[2:13:11] byrdeen45: Im just waiting for new world
[2:13:12] twanlol: AOC looks good but tbh im not hyped for it at all yet, needs so much more devlopment i hope htey dont release too soon.
[2:13:13] zuvic: I have confidence
[2:13:21] Spaede: kinda the same with Nvidia sending the 3000 series cards out to creators/vips early and consumers still cant buy
[2:13:21] idenkaz_: imo its way to early to show shit to the public
[2:13:23] ShadoodHD: i'll trust a CEO when pig flies
[2:13:27] BlackJAC__: they need the marketing, outside of just community hype
[2:13:29] WebsterLou: @zuvic promising and doing are to completely different things
[2:13:31] sifer007: it look good on papper
[2:13:35] Dirtnose: I feel like its suffering from people overhyping it too much. SWTOR had a similar issue way back in 2011. People expected it to be the best thing ever
[2:13:38] Shongoshi: couldnt streamer write off the alpha access cause he bought it to stream it and make money off of it ? ... not sure if taxes work like that in US
[2:13:39] rocthenite: @DreamWebb i am confused
[2:13:42] Sincline387: paying for a level 58 is unethical, paying 500 for access to an alpha is ethical
[2:13:44] SlayerLightStorm: How in the world do you even trigger that voice line @Towelliee ?
[2:13:48] Xockel: Im more hyped for Riots LOL MMO in the future.

[2:14:26] igor93: @Towelliee random question do you use LLC ir Scorp at all for streaming?

[2:15:51] Connectus: it *
[2:16:07] Alienfromger: you could write off food also if you eat on stream :)
[2:16:08] ShadoodHD: vegas trip too? ü§î not asking in a bad way
[2:16:08] TacticalWee: even your wow sub?
[2:16:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: tax fraud
[2:16:37] Connectus: @Alienfromger you aren't buying it for the stream though, that's a really thin line MingLee
[2:16:40] thecynicalshuffler: have tried?   lol
[2:16:40] MrGattz: you cant really write off food in general unless its a business lunch. which you cant really prove on a stream
[2:16:42] Connectus: Yup
[2:16:57] magemaster225: whiskey reviews, new stream
[2:17:04] Connectus: Yeah, but if they get caught they're fked MingLee

[2:44:45] Squirrel_nutty: i got no hope of getting 60 in 2 weeks
[2:44:45] DjLamboImBenz: There are vids out there telling you how to get nearly to 62 in 1:30 hours
[2:44:46] derElten: @RoadDogg723 about 1.25 levels if you can still hand in a lot of level 60 quests

[2:45:17] LeonardLongNips: From what I see 7-8 hours a day and you can hit 60 in 2 weeks

[2:45:49] Squirrel_nutty: does the xp weakaura dissapear once you hit 60?
[2:45:50] Folkja: 20 will probably get you into the instance lockout with the boost on a day if you go from 10-20 through rfc and sfk boosting
[2:45:55] dalaraz: just remember to have a lock teleport you out of silvermoon at lvl 1 :p gonna be crowded there @Towelliee

[3:00:45] DoubleNova: We have old lawmakers so it will be a bit longer
[3:00:45] NotEverSober: Most of the people who are hypercritical of WoW do it because they love it so much tbf

[3:00:50] Eluniar: Nobody hates WoW more than WoW players
[3:00:50] Thunder4o: i cant understand what is this trend tbh,people shit on blizzard for every single thing,doesnt matter if its good or bad,even if its good they gonna find a way to make it look bad and keep on hateing
[3:00:56] Kaihrn: it is scary how the Slander community is growing fast and its orth alot of money now on social media

[3:01:11] binhnguyen3: @towelliee no I mean the summoning stone
[3:01:27] Chiraakitteh: Twitch took way too long to start dealing with and giving streamers ways to deal/manage DCMA issues, this was an inevitable problem
[3:01:30] pixxelina: so true
[3:01:43] gooni_coyg: Do u look forward to level ur pala or do u want to get over with it to be ready for TBC?
[3:01:56] Rocman: I unsubbed thats the only way to make a point
[3:01:56] Spaghettisaucez: is the tbc patch good or too nerfed?
[3:02:19] Scarhearth: I have 0 issue with the TBC microtransactions. As a fool and their money are easily parted if they complain about a completely optional purchase ITS ON THEM
[3:02:23] Riggoz1: im sure alot of players will unsub which is totally fine. not everyone is as loyal to keep as sub as you imo
[3:02:27] Kaihrn: its like folk actualy get paid to do it on different platforms for alost anything today
[3:02:50] Vendatus: Venom 2 looking good SeemsGood

[3:03:14] BeekeeperBill: Not if you unsub
[3:03:25] pixxelina: so naive, jesus
[3:03:31] MrGattz: ALSO twitch and content creators is STILL only 2% of wows entire population
[3:03:36] MrGattz: we dont mean shit to them
[3:03:36] cordawg: See you after 10min of ads. ... knutCross knutCross
[3:03:37] Rocman: I'm disappointed  with wow in general, it's the most unfun it's ever been-for me
[3:03:40] Scarhearth: good luck getting millions of people to unsub
[3:04:02] brain_wash: lol, dont see folks who get paid to play video games striking...  oh the horrible working conditions....
[3:04:02] Broomba: elite
[3:04:21] Kaihrn: exactly lol
[3:04:25] rohdey: rohdey subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! only 18? seems longer
[3:04:26] Boccardo316: People think that twitch is mainstream for casual players lol
[3:04:28] Vonrus: whats the addon for the gathering nodes on the map?
[3:04:36] Vonrus: chat?
[3:04:44] Phoecian: I only care about ILevel being an advantage in Quickmatc. I car eabout nothing else KEKW
[3:04:46] rhodeos_: hot take, still looking forward to it..
[3:04:46] Camtully: 4Head
[3:04:48] MetallicusGaming: I'm having lots of fun both on Retail and Classic
[3:04:57] anOceaninadrop: @Vonrus it might be gather mate
[3:05:02] thorwann: My only problem with the microtransactions is the price, the price for the tbc digital deluxe edition is fucking stupid. Granted it is all optional cosmetic shit but still $70, plus the $35 cloning fee is super unreasonable.. Corporate greed at its finest.
[3:05:12] Innersane: @Vonrus Gatherer
[3:05:26] Chiraakitteh: casual players care that 1) the servers are available, 2) the game doesn‚Äôt crash so that they can play
[3:05:31] Sodbox: Don't bite the hand that feeds you ;)
[3:05:37] DreamWebb: stockholm syndrome
[3:05:44] Kaihrn: just look at the amount of views youtube videos get its like 5% max of the wow community that watches them lol
[3:05:52] byrdeen45: ya i loved wow even through wod but shadowlands just killed it for me so im playing ff14
[3:06:04] Destinos: still, 8-9 months without any new content is a bit sad
[3:06:23] Vexiusx: The thing is WoW doesn't have any real competition we need games like New World to succeed and rise up before Blizzard suddenly starts to care again about their customers.
[3:06:30] Reddevc: monkaS twitlonger
[3:06:36] Mecabeast: in a way content creators are like pseudo community managers
[3:06:44] Temaer88: To even move the needle would take more than twitch viewership haha
[3:06:52] mrmanno14: well they DID lose 30% of the active playerbase over 3 years
[3:06:55] inj0shwetrust: There is nothing wrong with being critical of the game you love and make content for as a streamer.  Just be constructive about it.  This isn't China you can speak up about things you don't agree with.
[3:07:12] Rocman: Ion will just add more currency and 5 more systems with 1% stat updates
[3:07:13] thorwann: Lets be real, if a mass exodus happened, Activision would probably just shut Blizzard down.
[3:07:22] SonofHorus82: I always just picture blizzard wiping their tears with hundred dollar bills like Woody Harrelson in Zombieland.
[3:07:31] kabam11: bobby should replace ioa as game directot imo
[3:07:32] obabathundae: venom 2  trailer just hit hope its gonna beat the first Pog
[3:07:33] Boccardo316: The loss of active playerbase has nothing to do with WoW. Hearthstone and WoW carries the whole playerbase for blizzard now
[3:07:35] Aaradin: I feel bad for the actual developers there, because it's not them, it's the people there that are more worried about money than the actual game.
[3:07:36] kabam11: ion
[3:07:42] MrGattz: shut blizzard down LUL
[3:07:43] DelcoAF: you dont think lose 29% of user base in 3 years affect them? It does and that's why they are increasing costs on their sticky players
[3:07:46] Mecabeast: I always used badlands for mithril farming
[3:07:47] pixxelina: LUL
[3:07:48] YardRage: slaughter the cash cow SwiftRage
[3:07:54] MrGattz: they would just end up firing everyone and starting over
[3:07:59] ShadoodHD: who also owns call of duty KEKW
[3:08:05] Exodeo_: I'm just happy to log in and play tbh
[3:08:06] cordawg: Just need to fire Ion to correct retail
[3:08:25] xch4se: xch4se subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[3:08:32] pixxelina: cute how some see Blizz as an indie games company or smt
[3:08:37] Vaedrun: Towellie what do you think what will happen in the future? Will there be any changes at all with the negative feedback.
[3:08:43] Rocman: They will lose alot of players in the next 6 months imo

[3:08:45] cordawg: They should.
[3:08:54] Fluaxx: It is who they pretend to target though.
[3:09:00] Nutsy: @cordawg Not a fan of Ion myself but if you think he is the fundemental problem to blizzards design philosphy you are delusional
[3:09:01] Chrissfrosty: didnt it come out in wrath?
[3:09:02] Vexiusx: The thing is WoW doesn't have any real competition we need games like New World to succeed and rise up before Blizzard suddenly starts to care again about their customers.
[3:09:06] ShadoodHD: they should eat hot wings during an interview Kappa
[3:09:30] PainIsMyGame666: Even if they target kids, rather than the gamers that were playing wow since vanila, they are going into the wrong direction, from both income/population.
[3:09:33] Innersane: Why are we so mad about the game today ?
[3:09:37] Svendv: Does any1 know if TBC prepatch comes with the reduced xp needed?
[3:09:39] Boccardo316: People think that Activision actually is worried about the 29% loss of playerbase. This only helps them to make more mobile games, so that the active player base will increase in the next years
[3:09:54] cordawg: @Nutsy Its the same thing with professional sports teams.  If the team sucks the coach its fired first.  Ion needs to go because Retail sucks.
[3:09:57] Innersane: Didnt blizzard blow on your bubu ?
[3:10:01] Innersane: Awwwww
[3:10:09] HaloS23: @Towelliee was your toon saying "ready to work" when minning?
[3:10:10] binhnguyen3: @towelliee can you use the meeting stone to summon in tbc?
[3:10:13] BelovedTheFool: I just want to play the game like I have for 15 years, I don't give a fuck about it's state
[3:10:18] Aidler: so the powerful influencer who can also influence the decisions of a company is a illusion
[3:10:21] mrmanno14: idk, even BFA had slower than usual patch cycles
[3:10:23] Affiiance: A lot of people like breaks
[3:10:28] Broomba: flying in 9.1
[3:10:34] brain_wash: Why would Blizz "Fix" something, that most of the player base NEVER stopped paying for?  srsly now
[3:10:34] obabathundae: why make a new Arena Season or M+ when you can sell the season Pass combining them Kappa "Earn pets , Gear and more ! " just 15 $ on top of the sub fee
[3:10:38] Immhey: The real problem is the drought. Not some specific design decisions.
[3:10:39] ZenjiBro: @Vexiusx I don't think that will matter. Look at what happen with Diablo 3 when PoE got big.
[3:10:40] Phoecian: More work?
[3:10:48] Affiiance: Yeah this one is a little too long
[3:10:55] fatherof_two: Are you mining for something specific
[3:10:55] HaloS23: has this always been an orc thing?
[3:10:57] nehnehTV: i came back last month after 2 years so im glad for the break to catch up before 9.1
[3:11:04] MetallicusGaming: HaloS23 yes

[3:11:33] HaloS23: dont really play orc
[3:11:34] cordawg: Never buy those 6month things
[3:11:41] Cognitive_Wanderer: ded gam
[3:11:51] Boccardo316: AOC will kill WoW Kappa
[3:11:52] Odinslayer: ion did confirm there's a 9.3 etc
[3:11:59] mwsoldier: @progettazione_inferni I do for TBC going to be sick
[3:12:05] DelcoAF: I hear you there
[3:12:07] obabathundae: Its been what 6 months of Castle ? @Towelliee
[3:12:11] Sodbox: wtf lol

[3:12:19] cordawg: Wont see 9.3 for 3 years
[3:12:21] WhiteKnight74648: Thats nutty
[3:12:46] Boccardo316: Asmongold plays WoW even on his second stream LUL
[3:12:47] Mecabeast: I get the 6mo sub just because it saves me money and I play regularly. just I'm currently on a break till 9.1
[3:12:49] thorwann: Alright they probably wont shut them down, but the notion that some people have, that the game would be better if people forced Blizzard to make the game better by quitting is silly. if anything it could pull support from wow because of the loss of popularity.
[3:12:55] Nutsy: It's addiction
[3:12:57] Sodbox: asmon on Rust
[3:13:02] Odinslayer: cause asmon suck with other games
[3:13:06] Sodbox: OTV Rust lol
[3:13:10] pixxelina: hehe yup
[3:13:10] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[3:13:15] brain_wash: just like 95% of the player base, pay to complain
[3:13:17] Vumbra: you guys arent addicted to WoW, its also your job @Towelliee
[3:13:24] pixxelina: so contradictory, it s annoying
[3:13:25] mwsoldier: @progettazione_inferni LUL
[3:13:25] GrayBush420: Influencer lol
[3:13:30] Phoecian: @Towelliee It's not an addiction Kappa
[3:13:32] Broomba: saying hes playing less wow and more different games - thats a sign of a trust issue
[3:13:39] inj0shwetrust: For sure addicted
[3:13:43] lovecult85: i cabt even count the times i quit! xD
[3:13:47] Innersane: Addicted to money more like
[3:13:48] adrian_fell: towelliee could just sit here and talk tbh
[3:13:50] buffalohandler: do you think that invalidates his criticisms?
[3:13:51] PepeTheFeelsGoodFrog: Thank you for acknowledging that Video game addiction exists!
[3:14:01] binhnguyen3: lol true
[3:14:06] ardilla808: Whats in november?
[3:14:08] DelcoAF: you're right there. I stopped playing after wrath, have two kids and a job, and watch you play it hahaha addiction
[3:14:09] obabathundae: @Towelliee I'm 5 months Sober Kappa SL killed my vibe
[3:14:12] FluffehZ: I dont play wow rooDerp
[3:14:16] buffalohandler: oh no I meant the addiction thing :D
[3:14:22] Immhey: At the end of the day, the pillars of the game like Raids, Dungeons and pvp are the best for me.
[3:14:23] inj0shwetrust: There is something to the game the satisfaction.  I feel it and I don't even stream or make any money from it, quite the opposite actually.
[3:14:32] SlapaH03: mama didnt raise a quitter
[3:14:36] JMoney_1331: show up for the content, stay for the community
[3:14:39] TealyBear: Why doesn't the orc peon voice play too? racist addon
[3:14:41] Immhey: They could wrap them in BS but they are still fun.
[3:14:57] binhnguyen3: @towelliee does summoning stone work in tbc?
[3:15:03] inj0shwetrust: Hot Tub Towliee inc?
[3:15:11] Miketolo71: we like the xpac
[3:15:11] Phoecian: KEKW
[3:15:14] Cartharon: best mithril farm stream ever
[3:15:17] Phoecian: True
[3:15:20] cordawg: This is the magic of Classic.  Farming mats feels good and means something.
[3:15:23] ShadoodHD: i dont want to play with you anymore *drops SL*
[3:15:23] Alepouditsa: i am lurking :P

[3:15:41] SlayerLightStorm: @inj0shwetrust NOPE. Never. GTFO. towRekt
[3:15:48] dalaraz: thats the good part of wow streaming,the downtime is god bless for streamers
[3:15:53] inj0shwetrust: lol
[3:16:00] MrGattz: wouldnt be his first cry for help
[3:16:02] Ruthron: @Towelliee I havnt played wow in like 2 months should i play retail or tbc classic?
[3:16:02] Innersane: Blood Elf Paladin !
[3:16:13] MrGattz: seems like he does one every year
[3:16:16] Innersane: It cant be boosted
[3:16:29] Vaedrun: he wants the devs to ban him :D
[3:16:30] TheOGDaywalker: lol
[3:16:32] rocthenite: it just had all the greatest hits he said on his stream in the last week
[3:16:33] Kize_Gaming: Step #1. Uninstall
[3:16:35] Squirrel_nutty: cant stop wont stop
[3:16:37] Vexiusx: Wait for better games to go live
[3:16:38] toyhutt: I started WoW for the raids 15 years ago.  Now, I'm 55 and log in just to do what your doing, farming nodes.  It's about the most therapeutic thing there is.
[3:16:43] TealyBear: Didn't Asmongold pay thousands of dollars for youtube ads of him playing WoW? Now it's biting him in the foot or once?
[3:16:47] adrian_fell: why are you assuming he wants to quit?
[3:16:49] Thoreya: Dogshit ass game doood
[3:16:53] Broomba: he and the twitch therapist had a session on friday @towelliee
[3:17:01] ShadoodHD: like a boy who cried wolf or...?
[3:17:06] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: DSAG
[3:17:10] inj0shwetrust: I don't think he wants to stop.  He just wants it to be great
[3:17:10] S1appadabass: its the yearly asmongold arc
[3:17:13] Dirtnose: @TealyBear ??
[3:17:25] Taco117: Is there going to be a marathon for tbc
[3:17:26] MetallicusGaming: I only read the 1st paragraph and the last coz I was expecting him to say he quit LUL
[3:17:32] thorwann: He complains about the dick in his salad but still continues to eat around it.
[3:17:34] TealyBear: @Dirtnose He paid a TON for youtube adspace for WoW videos. Now he's calling it garbage?
[3:17:54] DreamWebb: i think you mean "paying"

[3:18:01] dalaraz: @TealyBear he has issues with the prices,thats a different thing
[3:18:03] mrmanno14: His rant was more of a slam of the devs than the game itself. He emphasized how "incompetent" he thinks they are
[3:18:08] ZalkinMusic: 245 or so
[3:18:19] TealyBear: @dalaraz the loaded guy?
[3:18:33] dalaraz: 245 @Towelliee
[3:18:42] albiejw: Albie not Able danDerp
[3:18:47] binhnguyen3: @towelliee can we use the summoning stone for dungeons?
[3:18:47] dalaraz: @TealyBear thats irrelevant
[3:19:01] pett3ri: definetly not
[3:19:01] Mecabeast: have you tried the farm in badlands? not sure how popular it is on azure song
[3:19:02] massivekity: Thats the point man lol
[3:19:03] MrKhanes: No its not
[3:19:06] rocthenite: he think it is
[3:19:15] Broomba: he might have to do what soda did -- take a break and rethink your overall position and approach to streaming
[3:19:16] massivekity: That developers are having less powe
[3:19:19] MetallicusGaming: Do developers even make decisions don't they have to listen to the ones above them?
[3:19:23] massivekity: THATS THE PROBLEM
[3:19:24] Wammus: It's not like Ion comes into the daily meeting like yo time for more mtx
[3:19:26] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Those are more like marketing.
[3:19:27] Nilpointnil: it's adifferent team planning monetization, the devs literally responsible for the content and systems
[3:19:35] Scarhearth: microtransactions arent a developer thing. mounts in the store. TAKES Z E R O DEVELOPMENT TIME
[3:19:40] Sarocus: 250 for small thorium. truesilver and dark iron at 230
[3:19:40] ShadoodHD: "stakeholders"
[3:19:43] DreamWebb: im sure there is a in game shop team , are they not conisdered devs ?
[3:19:43] TealyBear: It's only Ghostclaw actually.
[3:19:46] Nutsy: It's bobby kuchek
[3:19:50] cbiskit89: But it sounds like in this case "developers" means the company developing the game and not literally the software developers
[3:19:52] Rastailian: so basically F Kotick?
[3:19:53] Reddevc: until your bosses are multi-yacht owners monkaS
[3:19:57] adrian_fell: yes but someone ends up taking the blame and evs are in the vanguard
[3:20:00] adrian_fell: devs
[3:20:04] DelcoAF: it's finance
[3:20:04] eyeztea: he is saying all of that just because his audience wants to hear it
[3:20:09] DelcoAF: YoY earnings
[3:20:15] massivekity: You're literally making excuses for the game, either way the game is fucked lol
[3:20:20] jerexify: @Towelliee Thanks Obama!
[3:20:20] Nilpointnil: thanks Obama
[3:20:22] Wammus: Don't blame the devs, blame marketing
[3:20:37] SlayerLightStorm: So, Jon Hight is a classic Andy then?
[3:20:37] pett3ri: i blame bobby
[3:20:39] Broomba: @eyeztea yes and hes buying into the spiel put out by bellular to justify his anger
[3:20:43] Vaedrun: john even blames john so thats ok
[3:20:56] willem__dafriend: definitely not a dev decision, the corporate side of acti-blizz will have done their market research and figured it's something they can get away with
[3:20:57] TealyBear: Ultimately you should only blame the top-guy imo

[3:21:45] SonofHorus82: I always blame J Allen Brack. He's been my go to blame since "you think you do, but you dont."
[3:22:01] Mecabeast: I wonder if they have a metric tracking how long people have been subbed since each expansion
[3:22:01] Nico_vdM: That reminds me of that comic strip where the boss asked everyone for ideas and the last guy is thrown out the window
[3:22:04] Blackplaguee: He the Blame Jane.
[3:22:08] rocthenite: @Towelliee dude i seen keven jorden saying ion should be fired over the tbc boost, ok boomer
[3:22:27] pixxelina: the scapegoats
[3:22:28] adrian_fell: part of the job as game director is responsibility so he becomes the punching bag, like , no shit
[3:22:35] Unciatim: I blame the original fave 5 who decided it was a good time to "merge" with Acti... lol
[3:22:42] Bullviine: @Towelliee - I think the issue is, Blizzard soesnt spend a lot of time listeening to the fans, they make a lot of decisions that affect the game without open disucssion on it.
[3:22:44] Aidler: so who is responsible?
[3:22:45] Unciatim: tim - idea
[3:22:50] pixxelina: Kevin is so bitter
[3:22:55] Dirtnose: did he actually say that? LOL
[3:22:55] Bullviine: *doesnt
[3:22:56] xxturkyjerkyxx: cash grab
[3:22:56] DelcoAF: anything money related is coming form the top
[3:23:01] geokouts: Blame the Marketing team
[3:23:03] fistofnature: Boddy should get fired LUL
[3:23:05] thorwann: Not everyone has the liberty to just quit and find a new job, so I completely understand why some developers might stay even if they disagree with corporate decisions.
[3:23:07] fistofnature: bobby*
[3:23:09] Thoreya: Damn people fucking hate ion
[3:23:11] Thoreya: Lol
[3:23:11] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:23:12] Mecabeast: imagine if twitch was telling people they needed to have x amount of hottub streams/subathons each month
[3:23:16] daegoh: what game has kevin jordan developed in the past 10 years?
[3:23:18] Arocian: hahahah 1000000 different opinions
[3:23:19] Ethstone: That is what feedback is though
[3:23:20] zSKIz1: GryzSki subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:23:25] Blackplaguee: They not going to missed the money in TBC they Overlooked on Classic
[3:23:25] crotastar: crotastar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:23:25] Ethstone: and being lazy about it got us here
[3:23:27] Blvdman: They could always POLL the decisions
[3:23:28] adrian_fell: Blizzard engaging in community discussions or debates is not beneficial for them
[3:23:28] Dagomarus: Those prices yell Activision all over for me 100%
[3:23:31] brain_wash: once again, no reason for open discussions when everyone is STILL paying for it.... no matter what the decisions are
[3:23:43] Aquadriel: yep
[3:23:44] Moobot: Towelliee is sponsored by G FUEL! The official energy drink of ESPORTS and THE HAMMER SQUAD! towHAMUP Use code ‚û° TOWEL ‚¨Ö at checkout for 10-15% off! gfuel.ly/3kf8stb
[3:23:47] MrGattz: thats a big zoom call
[3:23:51] Ethstone: that would never happen, what are you talking about lol
[3:23:52] Immhey: LUL
[3:23:55] TheRiwen: maybe but SL is in a bad state and  TBC is just money crap for them. So Something is wrong in blizzard.
[3:23:58] Aquadriel: timmy wants faster lvling, but jimmy wnats slower.
[3:23:58] Arocian: nope
[3:24:00] eyeztea: everyone has soo much to say but cant even tell their own bosses no and do exactly what they are told
[3:24:03] Arocian: yep
[3:24:06] pett3ri: ?
[3:24:09] ginjakk: MMO‚Äôs haven‚Äôt been as good since developers lost control of the game. They used to call the shots
[3:24:21] Broomba: if you took all the feedback from everyone you would have over 2000 million different wow versions
[3:24:24] Odinslayer: i literally play 6 alts and a main and i never once had an issue with conduit energy lol
[3:24:25] Ethstone: that was a terrible example bro
[3:24:27] Ethstone: lol
[3:24:29] ShadoodHD: or they will just go "f you" and leave... lol
[3:24:30] Temaer88: There are 10x more people who just want cool soul shape forms than care about conduit energy
[3:24:32] Nico_vdM: There are people that made their soulbinds and havent changed a single conduit since
[3:24:34] Chrissfrosty: i just dont like how manyy u get back per day just double it
[3:24:39] BeekeeperBill: Then the devs need to play the game
[3:24:46] Ruthron: @Ethstone how so?
[3:24:48] Blvdman: @Towelliee couldnt they just poll the feedbacks on decisions for the community to decide? similar to runescape
[3:24:49] PvtHudson093: If the conduits were better and not simmed to death for the BiS ones, i would care about conduit energy
[3:24:50] Thoreya: Bro people were pogging the fuck out when ion said to sloot ‚Äúlet loot be loot‚Äù and look how that turned out
[3:24:55] adrian_fell: I will admit that i really havnt been affected by conduit energy because i don't play that much different content but i still feel like asking why it exists is a healthy question
[3:24:56] Thoreya: Ppl are nuts
[3:25:03] techdough: and would you want a decision even based on that much information?
[3:25:08] Broomba: @BeekeeperBill devs play the game
[3:25:11] Blackplaguee: @Towelliee They gave us Classic basically free and missed a great money grab. They gonna cash in on TBC no matter how we feell.
[3:25:14] Alexkayzz: 90% of the pop thinks garrosh was bad but he did nothing wrong :(
[3:25:14] techdough: you end up with vanilla iced cream
[3:25:17] sleeptime123: hardcore players and casual have opposite mutually exclusive problems with the game
[3:25:18] Unciatim: @Thoreya What he meant is.. Let Less Loot be Less Loot
[3:25:21] PainIsMyGame666: You always ask gamers for game advice not casuals, so you got at least 5% of the wow population to ask, you dont ask kids tho... ther exp is way to low when it comes down to games. You ask adults, so you got less than 2% wow population.... that's not a lot btw. Reason why POE is sucessful.
[3:25:23] Ethstone: yea its really difficult to do, and whining about it and making up ridiculous scenarios just keeps us from ever figuring out how.
[3:25:26] AndrewShifuVA: maybe the game is too old and it's time it comes to an end...besides, wow doesnt have a competitor
[3:25:26] adrian_fell: didnt the survey ask for something like 10 dollars?
[3:25:29] Dagomarus: Tbh no one likes conduit energy theres apathetic people lile me who having energy doesn‚Äôt matter too since i never get close to over using it and those who it does affect who obviously don‚Äôt like it
[3:25:29] Dirtnose: They've explained why it exists. They dont want people being degenerate and changing their conduits every boss fight
[3:25:35] DelcoAF: right because they dont care about the feedback
[3:25:39] Aquadriel: who said 35 KEKW
[3:25:43] dreioo: hello, thank you for streaming today as well
[3:25:43] Barralgul: personnaly i thought the clone would be 25 just like a server transfer
[3:25:45] thorwann: Conduit energy has not even been relevant to me, I haven't changed conduits since I got the ones I wanted, its a dumb design but I can't say that it has any bearing on my gameplay
[3:25:46] raldrik: They use AI to inform those choices. They can look at demographics, what changes do to subscriptions and refine from there.
[3:25:47] Bullviine: @Towelliee - You got me wrong T, Id need to post a wall fo text to explain, but tldr, Blizzard dont listen to the community as much as they could do.
[3:25:47] TheRiwen: SL is bad right now
[3:25:48] byrdeen45: you should be able to clone 1 char free though
[3:25:49] PvtHudson093: maybe they just ignored the servay results
[3:25:50] Ethstone: Why not hire people to actually play the game?
[3:25:52] adrian_fell: Ion answered 35 dollars on the survey KEKW
[3:25:54] Ethstone: like you?
[3:25:57] PlotKox: The problem is that they make interviews where they sell an idea that is a lie. "we made these changes to effect this and this" when in reality that is a lie. they made the changes because it would make leveling longer meaning more sub money ect. I think that's the problem. They have to tell a lie to cover up that it's about money
[3:26:15] adrian_fell: that didnt happen
[3:26:17] Dagomarus: Who even says yes to that lol
[3:26:19] PG_diesel: @byrdeen45 agreed 100%
[3:26:21] Nico_vdM: They probably asked how do you feel about 10 dollars, 20 dollars all the way to 100 dollars and the average came out to `35
[3:26:25] Blvdman: I assumed it was 35$ Canadian not US Kappa
[3:26:25] Bullviine: @PlotKox - spot on
[3:26:34] jerexify: There was a survey?
[3:26:34] Unciatim: Is 35 dollars ok.... its mommies credit card... I dont' care
[3:26:38] TheRiwen: I will just play my ff14 and other games to 10.0
[3:26:42] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee or they priced for 35$ to discourage people from doing it.
[3:26:47] wolvepg: M+ is not in a good state you should be able (want to) to play every week
[3:27:00] ShadoodHD: i never got the survey and im like a boomer from vanilla KEKW
[3:27:03] SlayerLightStorm: @Alexkayzz He merged with the Heart of Y'Shaarj to try and conquer Pandaria. But he was stopped. He escaped to AU Draenor, and was killed by Thrall. I say, he deserved it.
[3:27:05] Aquadriel: ArcaneSyntax i think that was the case.
[3:27:05] crotastar: Sidebar... New Venom trailer just dropped.
[3:27:06] Boccardo316: A lot of people goes to asmongold video and complains about WoW but never played in their lives LUL
[3:27:08] theszoti: world quests are the shittiest system in shadowlands
[3:27:08] Holysal: @TheRiwen their cash shop is worse KEKW
[3:27:09] Nico_vdM: You're ok with 20?  But hate 60?  I guess 35 is reasonable
[3:27:13] WeedIsMySin__: I dont play the game
[3:27:14] Dagomarus: They asked their board of directors who are all rich and said can you afford $35
[3:27:19] DelcoAF: nah what happened is most people said 20 and they were like lets do 35, the ones who would leave already left anyway, we got the sticky ones here that wont go anywhere
[3:27:20] Ryan_yep: skipped classic straight into tbc
[3:27:21] Shongoshi: so what's the point of staying in classic ?
[3:27:22] Ethstone: @Arcane I read a post someone theorizing they actually want WoW to become less addictive, etc, etc,
[3:27:22] Matyrat: im just playing tbc because of that 35$ BS
[3:27:22] aikopooh: classic ganno be ghost town
[3:27:23] quizzie: it'll be wonderful for the bots, they can bot both games without having to lvl a new char
[3:27:24] TheRiwen: Nope my sub runs out in 6 days then i will play ff14 and other games
[3:27:27] adrian_fell: i mean can you imagine the internal discussion they had for the pricing of a  copy paste to make it 35 dollars? like what...
[3:27:30] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee in a way this makes fresh vanilla servers.
[3:27:34] Eras25: for $35 they should clone all character on 1 server .. not just a character
[3:27:36] SonofHorus82: I was thinking about the clone before the $35, now if I want to play classic I'll just make a new toon.
[3:27:41] Blackplaguee: Selling a game twice. How many times will Blizzard get the chance. LOL
[3:27:41] theoriginalzinng: i mean in reality you could keep your sweaty nerd classic character on classic and just level a new char on the tbc servers too for free
[3:27:43] dv_domino: it's BC or bust
[3:27:45] Reddevc: PepeLaugh
[3:27:45] Daemoos6: Everyone has phones... if you can afford a phone, you can afford a clone. Kappa
[3:27:48] DreamWebb: press x to doubt
[3:27:51] Alexm305: X
[3:27:53] daegoh: i cant wait until they announce the "fresh server pass" and everyone will go nuts
[3:27:54] fistofnature: you wish LUL
[3:27:55] SonofHorus82: I would rather level grind than play $35 to clone.
[3:27:57] klaymiester: lowered to $30
[3:28:00] TheGaoSora: oh my sweet summer child..
[3:28:03] Mecabeast: 1 mo after tbc releases patch notes servers a-d and e-g being merged due to population issues.
[3:28:03] dreioo: I can't see it remaining at 35 but that's just an outsider's perspective
[3:28:06] thorwann: I am gonna boost a character and go straight for BC, I really can't stand Classic leveling so I am more than happy to be able to pay for a way to skip that.
[3:28:06] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[3:28:07] adrian_fell: Mate people have complaining about MTX in wow and its pricing for a decade dude its not happening
[3:28:08] MetallicusGaming: HE KNOWS Kappa
[3:28:14] Kize_Gaming: But I already have the original collector's edition for TBC gachiHYPER
[3:28:14] Bayne77: Lower to $34 Kappa
[3:28:20] vikaelzidek: At BC release can you start at level 60?
[3:28:21] adrian_fell: 34.99 Kappa
[3:28:22] Ryan_yep: it benefits blizzard to kill off classic and move the hype into tbc no?
[3:28:23] MetallicusGaming: 34.99 LUL
[3:28:23] Dookeyy: pandemic prices
[3:28:24] PokerFaceMoose: ask for more than you want, then adjust
[3:28:26] Holysal: on the survey the didnt ask price. they asked how likely are you going to use the cloning service
[3:28:26] Dagomarus: I think the fact its optional is the thing thats gonna keep it high
[3:28:28] Xilandir: what if they make it an actual pass to make multiple 58's?
[3:28:28] Riggoz1: even if its $10 you will have people that complain
[3:28:31] Ethstone: lower it to if you play BC you get a free retail month
[3:28:31] Spaghettisaucez: tbc is free if you are subbed like classic?
[3:28:31] Derized_: The boost being 35 would be nice LUL
[3:28:33] TheGaoSora: @randomgoodthing that's a steal! PogChamp
[3:28:38] Blvdman: $20.00 CAD would be perfect :)
[3:28:38] w1ns1ow: They will lower it to 30 but require you to buy 2.
[3:28:39] Aedarax: we have heard you and are raising the clone to 40$ Kappa
[3:28:42] PG_diesel: They probably figured if everyone is buying gold to boost characters then they won‚Äôt have a problem paying to copy charscters
[3:28:43] TheRiwen: @Holysal I dont use it. The game is more fun then wow right now. Feel more like a mmo. WOW retail just feel like a acrion mmo where all has go fast.
[3:28:46] Eras25: well copy is cheaper then $39 lvl 58 boost lol
[3:28:48] Unciatim: @Towelliee Honestly... charging 35 is a self defeating practice... cause peeps will just not do it and the Classic servers will become dead zones.. then they are askign themselves, why are we kieeping these servers running....
[3:28:50] TheGaoSora: LUL
[3:28:51] Hupu_a: if they had put 20 dollars every one would be outraged about 20 dollars now they put it to 35 so when they lower it to 20 no one complains heck they might tell them  good job
[3:29:01] KVANNORWICK: There is no reason to even charge for the service at all.  They created a problem for us, and they are now trying to get us to pay for a solution.  BS!
[3:29:07] vikaelzidek: @Towelliee At BC release can you start at level 60?
[3:29:08] Blackplaguee: Selling TBC twice. If you can sell your car twice you would too!
[3:29:09] Holysal: @TheRiwen thats great :)
[3:29:11] Shallo1988: im actually surprised they didnt make boost 60$ tbh
[3:29:16] Shugaze: that 35$ is probably a test to see reactions
[3:29:17] Ethstone: *dark portal Scam
[3:29:20] MetallicusGaming: 35 dollars per server
[3:29:24] MetallicusGaming: would be great
[3:29:24] Scarhearth: A fool and their money is easily parted
[3:29:25] dalaraz: im telling you if they raise the 35,ill buy it cause they are cocky
[3:29:29] Scnozzberry: Towelii--i honestly believe the smallest age demographic in wow is kids...do you think wow is appealing to teenagers?
[3:29:30] Nilpointnil: POGGERS dark portal pass
[3:29:31] SealSore65: 35 literally isn't even bad. i expected like $60 considering it's blizzard
[3:29:35] Bayne77: $25 with a $10 processing fee and everyone will be happy
[3:29:40] Ethstone: 35 is awful
[3:29:46] WeedIsMySin__: COPIUM its a typo boys
[3:29:47] adrian_fell: i mean if you think about u are technically creating a new character that is lvl 60 even tho its a copy
[3:29:49] Ethstone: dont it isn't that bad just because its not 60.....
[3:29:49] freshlife: My server died after 1 year from classic release... they still won't merge
[3:29:51] Dirtnose: @prostate it literally is bad though. It's way too much
[3:29:52] Daemoos6: They just halved the price of the Deluxe Edition
[3:29:52] Aquadriel: 35 bucks is to compensate how cheap the boost is lmao
[3:29:52] Ethstone: *say
[3:29:52] Dagomarus: They could go with the ion approach and say ‚Äúi Don‚Äôt think its a too expensive issue i think its a more of being poor issue‚Äù
[3:29:59] Blvdman: lol fortnite
[3:30:00] Phoecian: @Towelliee Looks like I'm only playing Rogue KEKW
[3:30:01] Unciatim: zoomer games...keke
[3:30:04] Boccardo316: POGGERS
[3:30:07] Alexm305: Gamepass got reverted so maybe wow has hope
[3:30:08] Nico_vdM: It feels like they want everyone to move over to TBC Classic
[3:30:08] TheRiwen: My kids dont like wow. They play ff14
[3:30:11] sowhatimwhite: what's the #35 for? just tuned into stream
[3:30:11] Holysal: wow is a boomer game now
[3:30:14] Phoecian: IT HAS BEEN FOR ME D:
[3:30:15] Shugaze: wow catered to 15+
[3:30:15] sowhatimwhite: $35*
[3:30:16] Shallo1988: its us boomers lol
[3:30:17] DoubleNova: maybe at launch it did
[3:30:17] Ethstone: yea it did, MoP was the last
[3:30:18] Eras25: new generation plays shooters
[3:30:20] Innersane: TBC will be awsome
[3:30:21] ShadoodHD: roblox LULW
[3:30:23] croco_405: i am
[3:30:24] adrian_fell: it did back in wotlk/cata i would say
[3:30:24] Nilpointnil: vanilla catered to 15-20
[3:30:26] Scnozzberry: sadge
[3:30:27] Mecabeast: the time commitment and need of attention span is beyond what teenagers are capable of
[3:30:27] twanlol: I got into WOW cuz of Classic and im 18 xd
[3:30:27] Eras25: like COD or Fortnite
[3:30:30] Scarhearth: teens are screaming on CoD about how their fucked someones mom. WoW never catered to teens imo
[3:30:32] Odinslayer: i mean i did start playing this game when i was 15 and now am 27
[3:30:37] MetallicusGaming: I was 11 when I started
[3:30:37] veeta1: with lfr they're going for the <10 age bracket
[3:30:38] Broomba: seems like people dont and havent read the information about the clone fee or anything about tbc prepatch and deluxe option
[3:30:40] theszoti: i started at 13 at the end of wod LUL
[3:30:40] Ethstone: all those MoP kids are still running around but nobody younger
[3:30:42] Boccardo316: I'm young, 32 Kappa
[3:30:43] Redreka: which makes me wish it went rated M and story got a bit darker
[3:30:45] twarnak: Vannila,tbc & wotlk were popular with teenagers. Went downhill after that
[3:30:45] dalaraz: @Nilpointnil vanilla cattered to everybody
[3:30:46] Zavier420: @Towelliee Your going to play a prot pally in TBC right?
[3:30:46] Cr0wler: doubt
[3:30:47] Streamcrush: modern mmo's are more like Destiny than WoW
[3:30:49] adrian_fell: i got into wow in wotlk because it was super easy as a 13 year
[3:30:54] Phoecian: To be fair I grew up with WC3
[3:30:57] WeedIsMySin__: LULW
[3:31:04] MrKhanes: I was 19 when in started to play and now im 35 :)
[3:31:07] Innersane: We dont need the ragenerd kids
[3:31:08] Scnozzberry: Loloo
[3:31:09] PG_diesel: And it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a service that‚Äôs complicated or expensive for them to do. Can literally copy characters as much as you want and easily on ptr
[3:31:09] thorwann: Anecdotal evidence but when vanilla came out most people I knew who started back then was around 13-14 but these days probably not.
[3:31:11] Scarhearth: I mean i started WoW in 2005 and i was born in 98' lol
[3:31:14] fistofnature: old xbox live trash talking PepeHands
[3:31:15] Shallo1988: lol seriously
[3:31:15] SonofHorus82: shit I was 22 when classic came out. The RTS games were marketed more toward teens.
[3:31:21] wolvepg: and he fucked my mother
[3:31:21] dreioo: NOOB? D:
[3:31:26] DelcoAF: hahhaha
[3:31:28] Shugaze: in wow its more passive aggressive
[3:31:35] DoubleNova: barrens chat?
[3:31:38] DelcoAF: yelling sporadically
[3:31:40] TheRiwen: There are a lot of toxis people in wow retail
[3:31:40] azurrei: I mean to be fair it isn't simply a character copy (all character progression and gold is preserved on two servers to play) but anything more than $15-20 seems unreasonable given you can't play both at the same time
[3:31:43] PadidinJones: Damn those kids calling ppl Noobs and Nerds...
[3:31:44] Ethstone: yea we got older
[3:31:45] Sarocus: @thorwann There was a survey done in vanilla that put the average age of players at 28
[3:31:46] dixiekoala1376: I think that any "kids" that are currently playing have family that play or played
[3:31:50] dreioo: 45 is not old... oh
[3:31:54] Bayne77: I‚Äôm old people
[3:31:55] Derized_: True LUL
[3:31:56] MetallicusGaming: In WoW it's more like: "Dang my back just cracked" LUL
[3:31:58] dalaraz: @thorwann vanilla brought in all ages 15 to 50,not just teens.cause it was a new era back then
[3:32:01] RumBandit: *older* :)
[3:32:02] Rastailian: THD, get off my marmalade!
[3:32:06] Ethstone: was I old when I played vanilla at age 22?
[3:32:09] Unciatim: @Towelliee Only if they are at home... in the background... kids yelling.. KEK
[3:32:12] stealthx23: @Towelliee got to admit if the younger crowd did play this game they will be so much better then the usual wow players
[3:32:13] Eras25: when we start cracking sex jokes in my guild, all 18-20 years old feel  uncomfortable
[3:32:18] jerexify: It's me. I'm old people.
[3:32:19] Mecabeast: if a kid tried doing that in wow they'd get shut down hard by these gaming veterens
[3:32:22] Ethstone: there were so many kids back then
[3:32:22] Chiraakitteh: Wow doesn‚Äôt require split second reflexes, thank goodness
[3:32:25] PadidinJones: @Towelliee so you saying WoW is a adult game?
[3:32:30] mintcookie_vajankle: Imagine hating on the greatest expansion ever, our beloved, Mists of PandaExpress
[3:32:34] DelcoAF: Wow is the facebook of games
[3:32:34] S1appadabass: @towelliee how bout ya go fornicate yourself there pal!
[3:32:45] Ethstone: noooo twohead lol, thats so mean hahah
[3:32:47] DoubleNova: cringe no cap
[3:32:53] Bambouselled: That's when you bust out the "Don't make me become your step-dad"
[3:33:00] CushyPop: True, younger folks are all trying to be gangsters in GTA.  WOW takes too much patience.
[3:33:06] Blynx: i think mmorpgs in general cater more for people who are older
[3:33:07] MrGattz: so true
[3:33:07] TheRiwen: Retail just feels dead
[3:33:10] Nico_vdM: I think I had better luck in Burning Steppes / Searing Gorge with mithril
[3:33:10] SonofHorus82: which makes it all the more funny that blizzard removed Garrosh calling Sylvanus a bitch.
[3:33:13] dixiekoala1376: I think only adults will get alot of the hidden references
[3:33:13] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[3:33:14] Dagomarus: One step in goldshire confirms that its a adult game
[3:33:15] Ethstone: WoW has a lot of barriers
[3:33:15] TealyBear: I started at 12. I got to a 40th in the world guild. It was primarily older folks and kids like me that had crazy lives but stable internet.
[3:33:18] PadidinJones: I remember the kids started rolling in more at Cata.
[3:33:18] MrGattz: if its not instant gratification they want nothing to do with it
[3:33:22] Ethstone: established over the years
[3:33:26] Ethstone: you cant just show up
[3:33:31] Mecabeast: the battle Royale system that's popular only encourages that I think
[3:33:31] Ponas91: a 10 year old can level through the game now
[3:33:31] jerexify: @Towelliee Yep. Nowadays they want that instant gratification. I remember @Timthetatman talking about that when he was playing Classic during launch.
[3:33:36] tacofury2: iron or mithril?
[3:33:51] Scarhearth: As a 23 year old that has played MMOs all my life i dont understand why people dont play MMOs more imo
[3:33:56] twanlol: i dont thinki ts about attention span more about appeal
[3:34:07] tacofury2: outer edge of tanaris is really good for mithril
[3:34:19] Eras25: also new generation wants to buy Game Gold from farmers, they really want instant gratification with out putting in effort
[3:34:19] Kize_Gaming: Is ungoro too high for your mining ?
[3:34:22] Blynx: what ye gonna play in TBC
[3:34:24] Scnozzberry: its a very interesting discussion to me...because most games are able to appeal to teens.
[3:34:34] Nico_vdM: Why couldnt that pally have taken only the truesilver?
[3:34:39] SonofHorus82: I always find a ton of mithril in Burning Steppes and the Plaguelands.
[3:34:48] PlotKox: go to Arathi highlands @Towelliee
[3:34:51] Innersane: Fel Iron Ore
[3:34:52] Sodbox: T... for Mr. T (Mo) Hawk? @Towelliee
[3:35:02] Nico_vdM: btw grats of 60 on warrior
[3:35:08] manmower: need a job to pay that sub
[3:35:08] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢
[3:35:10] Nico_vdM: on*
[3:35:13] Scnozzberry: love to know those statistics
[3:35:13] TealyBear: I started playing the moment I saw it on xplay, on G4 TechTV
[3:35:15] Ethstone: Fantasy is for all ages, and I don't think blizzard can recreate 2007 anymore than we can
[3:35:17] DrMantisTBaggin: Yeah, they grew up when WoW wasnt as awesome Sadge
[3:35:18] rocthenite: i meet a classic pplayer who was 17
[3:35:18] Mecabeast: esrb is only about complexity of content in game not the online content
[3:35:33] Kaihrn: yeh i mean all the folk in my guild and most i talk with on server have all been playing for donkys years
[3:35:34] Holysal: imfiredup i think is like 20
[3:35:36] brain_wash: not enough Waifus in WoW maybe?
[3:35:40] RumBandit: I tried to get my daughter playing...she is 13...she got bored because of *too many quests* so, I agree with you @Towelliee
[3:35:46] Bambouselled: Man I'm only lvl 30 now, trying to hit 60 before tbc but it's such a grind playing alone.
[3:35:51] RolexKT: I'm 21 and have been playing for 7 years
[3:35:52] Boccardo316: Streamers can bring a lot of young players tho
[3:35:54] oJNelly: How come you‚Äôre playing warrior
[3:36:01] Ethstone: @Towelliee so you don't think WoW will ever be like Star Wars/Trek?
[3:36:09] cyclonos: @Towelliee the venom 2 trailer jus released good stuff
[3:36:10] DelcoAF: kids man... they dont wnt to work
[3:36:11] Ethstone: they want to explore?
[3:36:11] rocthenite: chorgast
[3:36:16] manmower: maybe them kids are onto something
[3:36:17] Daemoos6: @Towelliee I think you can remove/update that bot message about "Towelliee has not moved" :D
[3:36:18] Nico_vdM: The first night Sloot raided with BDGG, it felt like the rest of the guys were in their early 20s LUL
[3:36:25] divinedevilxd: @Towelliee these young kids just wanna play cod and fortnite and apex
[3:36:31] Innersane: @RumBandit lool
[3:36:32] dracullus: WoW could teach them more about job interviews than school
[3:36:39] Ethstone: i just wanted to fly on a gryphon when i was a kid lol
[3:36:39] MyriaK: My nephews call anything but combat "Blah-blah-blah"
[3:36:40] Kaihrn: herbing farming exploring caves wut!!!!!
[3:36:40] TheRiwen: SL retail also feeels like a job
[3:36:40] Blvdman: wow pvp is boom boom boom Kappa
[3:36:40] twarnak: RIght on brother

[3:36:46] Scnozzberry: instant rewards
[3:36:47] PG_diesel: They‚Äôd rather practice their 90s in fortnite creative
[3:36:49] QuantumleaperGG: Brraap
[3:36:50] Unciatim: @Towelliee Its called "Instant Gratification"
[3:36:51] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: valorant boom
[3:36:56] twarnak: All these big pumpers nowadays
[3:36:58] manmower: would a teenager bail on your m+ group after 1 wipe?
[3:36:59] S1appadabass: @Towelliee My 11 year old loves WoW, but I had to kick him off for a bit because he was shit talking in PvP and got a Warning from Blizz
[3:37:00] TealyBear: So are we less efficient because our attentionspan is longer? When neural networks like neuralink are out, they're going to be running laps around us
[3:37:00] DreamWebb: golden age of MMOs PepeHands
[3:37:01] Terdnugget: hows searing gorge w/ mithril?
[3:37:02] tommy_kt: im 21 and i used to watch my father raid in vanilla wow and ive been playing myself since
[3:37:07] m0t0_maniac: So I am trying to get back into WoW any suggestions on server?
[3:37:12] SlowMoJoe_TV: I‚Äôm so addicted to apex lol
[3:37:14] Ethstone: it does after you get yourself to the correct place :)
[3:37:16] dsdub: instant gratification isnt a young person only thing
[3:37:19] Dyonisia: I've been playing since 2007 when I was 36, my kids always thought WoW was uncool because Mom was playing it.
[3:37:20] Truppe4: Exactly! While im fishing in Ferales and watching you
[3:37:21] Gorestack: WoW could have a great battle royale battleground but they're just incapable of producing something good nowadays
[3:37:21] Ethstone: but you have to know things and ppl
[3:37:23] notviable_: @ProphetPK 23 myself but basically the exact same story
[3:37:29] RumBandit: @Innersane IKR...figured it would be the opposite...but to go off what @Towelliee is saying, she just wanted to be top level and wanted mounts and things...without working for it
[3:37:30] Scnozzberry: ooooohhhh so kids are lazzzzyyyy
[3:37:38] Alexkayzz: I started playing wow exactly when I was 18 during legion
[3:37:46] Mecabeast: I played all the halos and destiny for 12 yrs before finally getting a pc and getting wow
[3:37:50] TealyBear: I remember being 13 coaching my 30 year old sister on how to kill Malygos LUL
[3:37:52] Sers994: the game is older then them lol
[3:37:56] RumBandit: Ye1p4
[3:37:57] DelcoAF: lol
[3:37:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: the last video game my dad played was Wii Bowling LUL
[3:37:59] Unciatim: @dsdub Yes.. true.. but it is more prevalent though...
[3:38:00] Ethstone: Most of the players I played with in Legion were brats in MoP
[3:38:00] manmower: time for an overhaul
[3:38:01] Scarhearth: @ProphetPK 23 myself as well basically the same for me but i played along with my dad and raided with him in molten core
[3:38:03] dk_shrug: started playing WoW cause I saw my dad playing WotLK lol
[3:38:06] Ethstone: and they tried pretty hard at legion
[3:38:06] Shugaze: for wotlk classic it will be 20 years of wow
[3:38:08] dreioo: Jeff FeelsBadMan
[3:38:14] PlotKox: @Towelliee Just south of you in Arathi there is also mithril and Iron
[3:38:15] dalaraz: teenagers would love wow,its just hard to get em in the game  without a physical drawin
[3:38:15] Fhirn: FeelsBadMan
[3:38:24] Ethstone: yea
[3:38:26] TheOGMed: My grandson watches my daughter play WoW and she watched me play when she was a teenager lol
[3:38:27] Boccardo316: WoW is actually impressive how long it survived
[3:38:28] HaloS23: @Towelliee was 19 and single when i started playing.... 35, married, and 3 kids now...
[3:38:29] RumBandit: woops...cat walked on Kb...meant to say Yep...lol
[3:38:29] Innersane: @RumBandit Yes they dont really want to play a game they just want the things pop up in front of them to grab.
[3:38:31] Ethstone: this is the next thing
[3:38:35] Ethstone: should we stop WoW?
[3:38:39] Blvdman: atm i think its time/money invested that people still play
[3:38:40] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: The game of life lasts this long
[3:38:41] faulen: minecraft
[3:38:42] twarnak: Counter strike

[3:38:45] Scnozzberry: dalaraz thats exactly my thoughtss
[3:38:46] Immhey: MMORPG as a genre is built on the idea that you slowly accumulate power as you build your character. It's inherently at odd with instant gratification.
[3:38:46] MrGattz: 50k? try 50
[3:38:46] TheRiwen: I think there is more playing ff14 now then wow
[3:38:47] TealyBear: Yea man. I can't find a single MMORPG that I enjoy besides WoW rn, and I've played ALL of them

[3:39:03] rocthenite: @Towelliee asmongold was also going around that the deluxe pack mount was P2W because it give you a epic mount at 40
[3:39:04] S1appadabass: @Towelliee its WoW's style, no other MMO "feels" the way WoW does
[3:39:05] MrGattz: runescape has been around but its also had 3 full game launches
[3:39:10] dreioo: I want to play a Draenei Priest RalpherZ

[3:39:24] Lianor52: what about star wars
[3:39:25] Vumbra: i played vanilla back in the day when i was 20 and quit right before BC came out.  i started again in Legion and had more fun than ever and have been on and off since
[3:39:28] Ethstone: so go WoW 2.0 or say no more WoW, go get jobs?
[3:39:29] Zavier420: In vanilla our off tank was a kid and so was one of our locks. We had to mute both of them while raiding because they wouldn't keep their minds on what was going on.
[3:39:47] Dirtnose: People overhyping AOC way too much
[3:39:49] Ethstone: yea im sure it wont be like the last 300 times ppl wanted something and didnt get it lol
[3:39:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: and $500 poorer KEKW
[3:39:50] TealyBear: YEP, expecations are already set because of WoW jading us
[3:39:54] pixxelina: they already are disappointed
[3:39:56] Vexiusx: Ashes of creation is gonna be a dissapointment for so many

[3:40:14] Blvdman: LOOOL truuuuue
[3:40:22] Ethstone: we made the desert
[3:40:24] TealyBear: WoW snuck up on us though. I didn't hear anything until they featured WoW on xplay.
[3:40:24] Ethstone: ooo

[3:41:00] dk_shrug: MMO players are the most easily exploitable because they've been dying for a good game for decades
[3:41:00] Dirtnose: @manmower People think every new MMO will kill WoW. Then expect way too much and end up dissapointed
[3:41:01] Scarhearth: I remember Bless was called "the black desert online killer"
[3:41:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: its 2021, we already triggered
[3:41:20] asbringers: routine..
[3:41:23] PvtHudson093: it can only bring disappointment when AoC promises so much stuff
[3:41:35] RumBandit: AoC shows promise, but you are right....they need to make sure its polished or the short attention spans will wreck it if anything is off
[3:41:36] Vexiusx: New World is the only game worthy to hype over it's coming out this year and they have been PUMPING insane amount of content since last years preview event it's a whole new game. I really think it's gonna take many people by surprise.
[3:41:38] Blvdman: we've been lied to soo many times
[3:41:43] chundizzy: TBC is in 7 days?
[3:41:45] sifer007: first impression is so important
[3:41:47] asbringers: we eat same shit sinces x years
[3:41:52] Ethstone: Every content creator is realizing the same thing imo, Blizzard does not play their own game. You need to find a way to do player feedback somehow
[3:41:58] Ethstone: can't count on "devs" anymore
[3:42:00] MuttonChopins: I hope New World is good cause it was fun in Alpha
[3:42:02] Shallo1988: Assholes lol

[3:43:21] Cranghoul: 500 wtf
[3:43:22] Ethstone: and he gave that interview?
[3:43:26] RumBandit: @Alienfromger I dont think thats necessarily true...I think most people are looking for something completely new....but we want it to be polished...not half assed
[3:43:26] Ethstone: are you joking???? lol
[3:43:29] Broomba: 500 that might actually kill the game before its released

[3:45:18] MR_WYTE: @Towelliee - maybe good to mention that the $500 Kickstarter package also included a LIFETIME subscription to the game. Not bad value if the game survives a few years - good return on investment.

[3:46:51] Ethstone: You need players giving live feedback anywhere from 2hours-12hours playtime per day. Pet battlers to players that stare at trees. Ion has shown too many times he doesn';t get what game people are playing
[3:46:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: and you get a lifetime sub for that LUL
[3:46:54] AkVansky: damn you got stonked

[3:46:58] Immhey: LUL
[3:46:59] MrGattz: to be fair though, you pay 250-500 bucks and you got a life time sub which is also $15/mo
[3:46:59] dreioo: Ion please take us back
[3:47:01] anxietyrising: I refuse to kick start anything after getting burned by EQNext
[3:47:02] vimie: Gottem LUL

[3:47:14] Shallo1988: oooof
[3:47:15] TheGaoSora: oof
[3:47:16] Ethstone: and raid logging just backs up his crap takes
[3:47:18] Nico_vdM: Now that 35 dollars to clone doesnt seem that bad LUL

[3:47:34] Innersane: That is crazy
[3:47:35] MrKhanes: Oh i will watch! Bet on that! And i will love to see it!
[3:47:35] dracullus: many probably don't remember ESO had regular sub on launch
[3:47:39] TheUnknowing: its good we can ask towelliee cause im not going to play it, probably ever Kappa
[3:47:39] Ethstone: does Ion pvp?
[3:47:41] Bullviine: thanks for laying on my behalf T, appreciate it :D
[3:47:43] AkVansky: heard it here folks, do anything we want
[3:47:43] SonofHorus82: I could clone every classic character I have for way less than that.
[3:47:46] gundamzeros01: ima just do quest ,chill around in my all time favourite game , level alts just to mess around on WoW that is LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:47:48] adrian_fell: @Towelliee do you think wow has remained unrivaled in combat systems across the board?
[3:47:48] Ethstone: like 200 games a week? 20? nah?
[3:47:51] Bullviine: *playing
[3:47:52] drawls6d9: you said "ashes of creation community". a community exists for a game that doesn't exist yet??
[3:47:59] AkVansky: he's freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[3:48:03] asbringers: thanks Towelliee  for spend 500 buck Kappa
[3:48:09] manmower: so you know it's good already
[3:48:12] UglyGang420: Is the 58 boost happening on pre patch?
[3:48:12] AkVansky: chocotGulag
[3:48:14] NICloud_TV: The amount of people that will pay for that is gonna boost their budget about 5x lol
[3:48:16] Zavier420: @Towelliee The ashes kickstarter began May 2nd 2017
[3:48:19] Chiraakitteh: If people like Skyrim, eso isn‚Äôt a bad choice for a game
[3:48:29] Shallo1988: so how long is the alpha 1? a week?
[3:48:32] NICloud_TV: hopefully sheesh
[3:48:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: No bugs COPIUM
[3:48:44] MrGattz: oh ESO is a FANTASTIC game. i cant praise eso enough if you really enjoy adventure rpg games
[3:49:09] twanlol: ESO's questing and story is amazing imo
[3:49:11] MrGattz: and eso has amazing controller support
[3:49:17] MrGattz: if you want to play it on your couch
[3:49:18] hulimonduli: whats up man
[3:49:19] Toradin: ESO is sick now
[3:49:21] Immhey: Toweliee fell for it LUL
[3:49:21] asbringers: because eso have mutch solo content
[3:49:23] manmower: ESO had the weird combat on PC right?
[3:49:32] Toradin: not
[3:49:35] rhodeos_: eso is 100% worth it, even for just one character level through
[3:49:38] belfastcl: eso is a good game
[3:49:40] Vrumpt: ESO's inventory limit rubbed me the wrong way
[3:49:40] MrGattz: canceled
[3:49:43] DreamWebb: why do people feel entitled to play alpha versions of the game ? LUL they are obviously generating funds for the game and taking advantage of impatient people willing to pay 500 dollars
[3:49:45] HaxzorJimDuggan: you paid 400 and got a lifetime sub and access, they pay 500 and only get a year of sub KEKW
[3:49:53] Chrissfrosty: what about wildstar
[3:49:56] PokerFaceMoose: you can play crowfall in beta right now
[3:50:06] manmower: the last good MMO launch was Warhammer Online
[3:50:07] MrGattz: @Vrumpt its not so bad if you play a lot you can just farm gold and use the gold to upgrade your backpack
[3:50:24] Shallo1988: lol
[3:50:25] Eras25: to me nothing is better then WoW, only other good MMO is FF14. everything else does even come close
[3:50:27] MrGattz: same with your mount speed and mount stuff. just gotta play a lot
[3:50:27] rhodeos_: i hope they pull a new world
[3:50:28] Thoreya: lol we'll see
[3:50:34] Thoreya: no pressure
[3:50:35] NICloud_TV: Glad you care so much about MMORPGs at least <3

[3:51:23] MrGattz: new world so far is looking really fun
[3:51:28] MrGattz: i cant wait to see what they do with it
[3:51:32] Vexiusx: New world is gonna be lit, their updates the last year they made is beyond nuts. More content then added in that last year then WoW has added in 5 expansions
[3:51:35] manmower: which MMO is going to put a BR inside the game?
[3:51:36] cavi_XD: After Cyberpunk, its hard for me to truly care about games making promises
[3:51:38] Streamcrush: I'm kinda hyped for New World, ngl
[3:51:42] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: Are you hopeful for Pantheon? @towelliee
[3:51:48] twanlol: its weird im more hyped for new world than AOC i just hope this alpha proves me wrong heh
[3:51:49] Calphurnious: I enjoyed NW, was surprised that I need to upgrade my ram though. Was always near my ram mat at 16gb

[3:52:37] dalaraz: blue to green
[3:52:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: for their sake the servers better be stable or the refund requests are gonna be glorious LUL
[3:52:46] TheUnknowing: i mean with a 500 entry cost, there will be like 10 people maybe outside of media and streamers so the servers should be fine
[3:52:48] Mecabeast: I saw the gta rp thing was doing a dark portal event for the wow players

[3:54:40] rhodeos_: it would turn into an asmongold simulator
[3:54:42] cavi_XD: Super over micro
[3:54:48] NICloud_TV: Too many games releasing alphas/betas before they even have a real plan imo
[3:54:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: i hope its good but i would invest in doge coin before a new mmo with this many promises
[3:54:56] aikopooh: too realistic for me lolz
[3:54:56] Stupotty19: Thats what i hated of BDO. Loved the combat but the node managment and worker managment was just way too much
[3:55:01] UglyGang420: All the streamers will run the servers
[3:55:08] Shugaze: game gonna be micro politics LUL
[3:55:14] tyrel_jones: Jesus are they going for a Civ type game

[3:55:30] UglyGang420: Pvp is not meant for mmos
[3:55:33] UglyGang420: It never works
[3:55:34] Blvdman: KILL HIM
[3:55:36] Calphurnious: Gonna get the H&R block addon for aoc, handle all them taxes
[3:55:44] Shugaze: pvp more like politic vs politic, taxes really
[3:55:46] ninjitsu124: kill his nitch ass
[3:55:48] Mecabeast: I think thats a nostalgic view point for most where people remember 1 or 2 big guilds running things in like everquest or runescape
[3:55:51] twanlol: its fun but on a very competitive level it will always be unbalanced @UglyGang420
[3:55:56] Dorky1495: everyone knows that pallies are OP farmers, so everyone making one now
[3:55:57] jeneraljelly: you could just do mara runs for mining
[3:55:57] priest_evolved: it's going to flop....they've promised way too much that I don't think can be delivered anymore..... people want instant gratification now, and that sense of community if left to the older players who remember it

[3:56:56] MetallicusGaming: enjoy Zapotek_S ;)
[3:57:02] pixxelina: the mounts look dogshit
[3:57:08] SonofHorus82: @the_brazilian_runner They're to busy complaining about $35 and $75 WoW services, but more than willing to shell out $500 to play an Alpha.
[3:57:14] Stupotty19: the node system was pretty cool in BDO
[3:57:17] Zapotek_S: @MetallicusGaming why thank you :)
[3:57:17] Boccardo316: @SonofHorus82 true lool
[3:57:27] Stupotty19: alot to setup and created a weekly pvp event
[3:57:43] remixonfire91: bdo is mostly solo lol
[3:57:43] Templexx: and thats why im super skeptical
[3:57:45] UglyGang420: The node system isn‚Äôt a welcoming system it‚Äôs a huge turn off
[3:57:54] Stupotty19: Can agree, never had fun unless i was in a guild.
[3:57:57] Eluniar: BDO is fine solo, not sure about the others
[3:58:18] FreshgamingQ: it sounds ignorant but a node and tax, economy system is simply not fun. it always ends up being work only a very few ppl rly enjoy (and dominate the market)
[3:58:21] Streamcrush: You think Riot's mmo will be similar to WoW?
[3:58:36] FreshgamingQ: always dounds nice and deep, but simply is one step too far for an mmo
[3:58:47] Zippaya: limit, echo, method etc :D
[3:58:50] UglyGang420: Riots mmo is the only mmo I‚Äôm waiting for other than blizzard mmo

[4:00:14] Runamar: I don't think Ashes is as endgame focused as wow
[4:00:19] Phoecian: Anyone else realized that BC is on the PTR??
[4:00:30] azzurrin: It worked in WoW because that was 17 years ago.  Times change
[4:00:33] Vrumpt: All the devs are former everquest/lineage devs
[4:00:34] Sonatta: meaningful abilities and quest rewards
[4:00:47] TyndiVelspaz: isn't that faster than Classic WoW? ~200 hours to max level where Classic Vanilla was ~240?
[4:01:01] LazyDynamics: the make or break point is, how do power guilds impact a casual player @Towelliee

[4:01:06] kokochris: Trying to create a no life game from scratch is hard.  It will turn off a lot of people before they even give the game a shot.   They need a really good hook to keep people wanting to grind.  Might be social, might be action gameplay, might be story.  They need something big.
[4:01:06] SonofHorus82: @un_c4nny is that what that update was? At this point I'll just wait a week.
[4:01:06] dracullus: meeeeningful journeeey through Azeroth
[4:01:07] NoSkillNoCash: that's the way Warhammer did it, each level bracket brought new pvp content
[4:01:09] crawcook: @azzurrin I would agree, but at the same time classic brought a ton of players, so I wouldn't just say it's because times change
[4:01:09] throwawaym3: What game is doing this?
[4:01:10] Grel420: Clearly there is a high demand right now for old school EQ / vanilla wow step mmorpg
[4:01:19] Sonatta: like getting a Whirlwind Axe on a warrior
[4:01:34] eatonaround: what is supposed to be max level in AoC?
[4:01:36] Phoecian: @SonofHorus82 Yeah that's what the patch was KEKW
[4:01:39] D3V1L_MAN: Good morning Towelliee and chat! I finished [What a Long Strange Trip It's Been] on Sunday!
[4:01:46] TyndiVelspaz: or was Vanilla closer to 170?
[4:01:50] Aquadriel: yeeaah that aing not gonna end well
[4:01:58] azzurrin: Yea, but classic was a huge nostalgia trip and not a complete new game with no back story.  WoW could do that
[4:02:16] Aquadriel: I see it comming "on alpha 2 we reducing experience needed, now will take 30% of original time to get to 15"

[4:02:21] azzurrin: Ashes is a brand new game there is no reliving you younger years or nostolgia
[4:02:21] crawcook: If the world is interesting I think a lot of people will enjoy the longer leveling.
[4:02:46] Sonatta: farming the dragon in Hillsbrad
[4:02:57] DevilinAus: This is soooo true dude!

[4:03:11] Grel420: Am I crazy that I just like the old school style better? I have no nostalgia for original Everquest but play it now and dig the game design a lot
[4:03:13] crawcook: @azzurrin Yes, but at the same time classic proved there is definitely a hunger for older type of mmo.
[4:03:15] Bombayshow: yeah cause people want to run mythic + 21 asap LUL nice content
[4:03:15] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[4:03:17] twanlol: man leveling is so much fun

[4:04:07] dalaraz: @Towelliee you can pick his vein without taking the ore,while he does it,just for the skillup
[4:04:11] Aaradin: it was insane
[4:04:13] Sonatta: you can tell with the amount of leveling content SWTOR launched with, the leveling time was definitely supposed to be longer and at some point they cut it down
[4:04:15] The_Dane_Train: I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I think quality content at all level ranges is truly casual gameplay.
[4:04:15] moshcraft: I just did it while leveling but my server isn't high pop
[4:04:16] FreshgamingQ: you bot yourself :D
[4:04:16] SonofHorus82: very carefully
[4:04:21] azzurrin: Yea, because it was WOW, and not some new MMO.  I can gurantee you if it wasn't WOW it wouldn't be  as nearly as popular.
[4:04:21] mwsoldier: Kill them I'm on pvp
[4:04:28] Shongoshi: pretty sure bots dont mine, they pickpocket in BRD
[4:04:35] SonofHorus82: I also pull the entire zone worth of mobs on top of them.
[4:04:35] StraightErro: You outsource the work, Kappa
[4:04:41] Bombayshow: They should make it that leveling is content until the raid release , most of people are burned out BEFORE the raids comes out
[4:04:43] Bombayshow: each time
[4:04:47] MuttonChopins: have you seen the new Athene video @Towelliee

[4:07:45] Oakdarkness: he showed the game in the last 2mins of the video
[4:07:46] Shugaze: by watching it with his 30k viewers, its kinda hyping it
[4:07:47] TheDeathbinder: He got baited LUL
[4:07:49] throwawaym3: Athene jabaited him
[4:07:54] MuttonChopins: I think asmon said athene messaged about the game too before the video

[4:08:26] Shugaze: bad press is still press!

[4:09:41] Biorrwolf: Can't decide if I want to roll Pally as soon as PP drops, or use the xp boost to push my 23 hunter to 60

[4:54:01] LSBreed: still you're a realist. you don't lash out at them and spout dumb shit.

[4:54:25] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee irritation, discontentment, basically negative feelings
[4:54:26] cordawg: Just shows 100% that Blizzard wont listen to what the WOW community wnats, they just will do whatever they want.  @Towelliee
[4:54:29] Gruffian: BIG TRUE
[4:54:29] Lulaboo: I dont understand who thought emailing a higher up to demote Ion was a good idea

[4:54:39] shafflar: i dunno how that respond is relevent when blizzard lose 30% of their paying customers during corona
[4:54:39] 91Niki: ire = anger
[4:54:39] DrakhanGaming: I think thats what zoomers call a chad
[4:54:42] Mecabeast: isn't bellular a game designer although small time

[4:55:13] gungrave1337: except he didnt
[4:55:15] TheUnknowing: Why is it fake? @s1ug
[4:55:17] DirtyBeef2134: What server are you guys on for TBC?
[4:55:19] jasperboy: They need some aloe vera because they got burned, hard.
[4:55:19] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢
[4:55:21] Mallaes: The BURN!!!
[4:55:22] gungrave1337: and this shit is as fake as it can be
[4:55:28] idenkaz_: im pretty sure most people that play the game have anything to do with the twitch culture
[4:55:28] Kinghorn: azuresont dirtybeef2134
[4:55:29] brain_wash: that smoke
[4:55:31] PidiaP: I just refuse to believe that‚Äôs remotely real
[4:55:32] Thoreya: JAB don‚Äôt give a fuck LUL
[4:55:34] kofijuve: If im gonna choose between streaming community and J Allen Brack i choose the latter
[4:55:34] Skylin3r: hmm interesting, classic ptr is only 3.5gb download
[4:55:35] Kinghorn: azuresong, frick
[4:55:35] billybaggens: f'n REKT

[4:55:43] MagicHoof: enigmaKEK
[4:55:44] AF7_EGO: how do you justify the loss of subs if not a reflection the community is not happy?
[4:55:48] Thoreya: I believe its real blizz leaks everything
[4:55:49] 91Niki: Internet spergs don't have that kinda vocabulary LUL
[4:55:51] s1ug: @TheUnknowing because the idea that j brack is replying to random players with memoirs is very unlikely
[4:55:51] cordawg: Shows are hard headed and ignorant Blizzard leadership is.
[4:55:58] LSBreed: towRip asmon, bel, and preach.
[4:56:00] DirtyBeef2134: @Kinghorn horde?
[4:56:03] TheUnknowing: says who? @s1ug
[4:56:04] FranciscoTheMage: who said what now? where can i find it on the net?
[4:56:04] Kinghorn: yeah horde
[4:56:05] gungrave1337: "normal person"" lmao
[4:56:06] primetimezhilex: @Towelliee  im ready for some game time giveaway :)
[4:56:08] s1ug: @TheUnknowing me
[4:56:10] DarthVapour420: he's not wrong but neither are you guys with your criticism
[4:56:11] gungrave1337: read a book lel
[4:56:21] KingSlayerYotam: where can i read that?
[4:56:23] TheUnknowing: You know him personally and speak for him? @s1ug
[4:56:28] 91Niki: https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/58433-player-emails-blizzard-executives-and-requests-ions-demotion-blizzard-president-j-allen-brack-replies/
[4:56:29] s1ug: @TheUnknowing show one other example of him doing so
[4:56:32] 91Niki: If you guys want to read yourselves
[4:56:34] WinterSoonBe: Am I getting this right - he dismissed the idea that Content creators can bring valuable cirticism? Did he just call them instigators?
[4:56:37] GiraffeHydra_: @AF7_EGO I think its more what they're unhappy about, as in what the community and the "streamers" are asking for are at odds
[4:56:41] subversv: @91Niki ty !
[4:56:47] LeonardLongNips: I mean both sides can not be wrong in this case.
[4:56:48] Aravarth: DGMW I'll watch Asmongold's streams with some regularity, but folk like him and Preach and Bellular -- loud voices within the community -- are simply a vocal minority
[4:56:54] manmower: never mess with a man's livelihood
[4:56:55] 91Niki: Exactly
[4:56:58] TheUnknowing: @s1ug I don't need to, just like you cant say its not real because you just dont know
[4:57:02] Aravarth: and don't necessarily represent the entire community
[4:57:04] CCG_337: lol wow drama,  and streamers are eat themselves
[4:57:07] cordawg: Yeah but we are the players.  the game is for US. not the Devs
[4:57:08] Mecabeast: @towelliee death knight discord just put out some merchandise to celebrate 10yrs as a community lol
[4:57:09] gungrave1337: @Towelliee  Bellular is literally an indie game dev
[4:57:16] scarletsix: So why are people leaving the game then? All is fine?
[4:57:21] SlapaH03: more like influenza
[4:57:30] 91Niki: It's an opinion, that's all it ever is.
[4:57:33] s1ug: @TheUnknowing lol. you think its more likely the pres replies with juicy memoirs to random players than someone faked an email. thats your issue.
[4:57:42] 91Niki: And all of wow's players don't share opinions
[4:57:44] AF7_EGO: @GiraffeHydra yea, i understand that way of looking at it
[4:57:46] Justarandomman: We need skippys oppinion, the voice of reason
[4:57:50] adrian_fell: because those people play the game way more than the average viewer does what the fuck you on about
[4:57:59] MagicHoof: LUL
[4:58:01] Eluniar: Streamers aren't game devs but that response kinda frames it like their opinions aren't legit, or are just for views ... I dunno about that one
[4:58:05] nei_fax: well i guess droopzdworf speaks for me
[4:58:05] 91Niki: Exactly
[4:58:06] gooni_coyg: I speak for da horde!
[4:58:09] bearforceone59: You actually can give more credit their opinion; things like time-played and a loyal viewerbase
[4:58:14] Capy_IRL: 30% player base drop, profits up. That's just facts no matter what side you sit on
[4:58:22] Kinghorn: that is UBRS
[4:58:24] Biorrwolf: My. MOM
[4:58:29] GiraffeHydra_: Won huge emerald, thats the crown of the wow community. Hail king Towelliee
[4:58:47] Gruffian: Some of these content creators don't even really play the game like normal players. They don't push keys, they don't raid, they only PVP when they are getting carried. Their opinions are so shit.
[4:59:01] rocthenite: @Im_Capy ok you just pukle out whatever that bald keren puke out
[4:59:18] moonscryer: player drop, profits up means your job just got harder and the ability to please your core fanbase is impossible.
[4:59:21] OG_Fear: What times/days are you guys planning on raiding in tbc classic @towelliee
[4:59:21] Vexxsis: just play the game and stfu ppl... that's all it boils down 2
[4:59:26] Kinghorn: did you get the main lbrs quest for the ony attunement
[4:59:35] 91Niki: Just because you have 1000s of hours in a game, and a loyal viewer base doesn't make your opinion valid. You can have a shitty opinion no matter how long you've been in "the game". Just look at politics LUL
[4:59:35] rocthenite: OTK is a posion
[4:59:36] toobaked1987: Asmon, Preach, Bellulame think they speak for the best interest of WoW. They speak about what interests them, not the community as a whole.
[4:59:37] Justarandomman: @Gruffian Oh this is a pet hate, the asmongold classic experience, being traded and boosted everything then formulates strong opinions on the game
[4:59:42] Capy_IRL: @rocthenite or i just read articles that are posted every where and don't have my head shoved up my ass
[4:59:48] cameron3332: @rocthenite LOL

[5:00:22] Vexxsis: @droopydorf SeemsGood
[5:00:28] crawcook: I still think the opinion of a streamer is to some extent valid and worth considering, taking into account how much they play, as long as the opinion isn't toxic.
[5:00:29] DeanoTV: KEKW
[5:00:29] flebbooo: LUL
[5:00:33] Sodbox: 
[5:00:35] idenkaz_: @toobaked1987 to be fair, most of the time they state its their own opinion and dont speak for the playerbase. so its not fair to say that
[5:00:35] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: okay
[5:00:36] rocthenite: asmongold simps
[5:00:38] OG_Fear: lol

[5:01:00] scarletsix: OFC it is.
[5:01:03] Douggi3: What happened?
[5:01:05] 91Niki: Hell, even the game devs opinions might not be the best. But in the end of the day, they are the people who are in control, and will do what they believe is best for the game. If you don't like that, there are plenty of other games out there ü§∑
[5:01:06] Collected1: i dont think its fake.

[5:01:38] TheOGMed: He's a streamer that couldn't hack it
[5:01:39] Zander_TheGamer: It isn't fake.
[5:01:39] Justarandomman: I don't think he would write something like that, as he would know it'd incite more anger in the community
[5:01:41] belfastcl: those are the 3 most prominent critics, but there are others
[5:01:45] Fredster134: what's happening?
[5:01:49] Shugaze: its pretty much blizz simps vs blizz haters atm

[5:01:59] GrumpyButts: It's a veryunprofessional response so I doubt it's authentic
[5:02:03] Biorrwolf: Is this. Monster Hunter music?
[5:02:10] 91Niki: I'd imagine if it's fake, a CM would come forward and shut it down.
[5:02:13] Eluniar: It's kind of a toxic take ngl. Streamers only say x because of money, they don't really feel this way
[5:02:16] Vexiusx: Can i have a link to the post?
[5:02:17] Collected1: i can totally believe he thinks that.
[5:02:21] idenkaz_: unprofessional response? huh
[5:02:25] Shugaze: @Vexxsis thats not the first time he did unprofessional stuff
[5:02:26] FranciscoTheMage: Bottom line is @Towelliee ION aint going nowhere
[5:02:28] DarthVapour420: it definitely speaks to their whole attitude towards streamers
[5:02:29] brain_wash: what does unprofessional have to do with it?  Ion just told the whole community to get gud
[5:02:29] CCG_337: like I said wow streamers ate themselves lol
[5:02:30] K_A_N_J_I: I think he means streamers have a huge influence on thousands of people and they spreading their negative opinion is causing anger from certain pockets of the community
[5:02:34] LeonardLongNips: Its semi unprofessional from someone of his rank within a company. Just my opinion.
[5:02:36] shimwood: What does he think about me BibleThump
[5:02:38] Reddevc: depends on how much he has listened to bobby LUL
[5:02:39] Vexxsis: @hbsumo  nope
[5:02:40] d3admangaming: @Towelliee IT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE STREAMERS THAT CAUSE SHIT
[5:02:41] warrenny: @grumpybutts Hows it unprofessional? Cos it doesnt kuss the fans ass?
[5:02:47] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee depends on his exposure. If he only watches the "biggest audience" streamers, he'd form an opinion based on that for sure
[5:02:48] d3admangaming: srry caps
[5:02:57] Relyt97: Theres a difference of being mad at something in the moment and going out of your way to completely shit on things
[5:02:57] Collected1: i dont think it's that bad towelliee. clearly Blizzard has time for some twitch streamers.
[5:02:58] Relyt97: imo
[5:03:02] FranciscoTheMage: the question was specifically about those streamers. he can always say he was referring to them
[5:03:02] DrakhanGaming: They dont even know whats going on in their own games i doubt they know much about twitch
[5:03:06] Collected1: T&E getting invited to do the Q&A proved that
[5:03:11] Vexiusx: Like asmongold needs money lol
[5:03:14] Vexxsis: @hbsumo  like I said..what can you do though right.

[5:03:23] Padarius: I mean that's why Jerry Springer was successful. create Drama, people eat it up
[5:03:26] 91Niki: Drama, and toxic content brings people to the table, cuz people love to watch the world burn LUL just reality
[5:03:27] Sugartoez: Take a step back outside of your bubble if you have trouble imagining that the vast majority of the playerbase doesnt exist on twitch. Many people don‚Äôt play the game the way your favorite streamer or you do. That‚Äôs what developers have to consider. If you‚Äôre here right now, realize you‚Äôre part of the minority
[5:03:30] elvia_: negative videos are watch twice as much than the positive videos on youtube @Towelliee
[5:03:30] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:03:31] DarthVapour420: neither is the criticism they level at blizzard
[5:03:34] PvtHudson093: Preach dosnt make money on his youtube vids
[5:03:43] cordawg: Welp see you in 5min after Ads.
[5:03:44] Aravarth: Why do you think Fox News is so popular as a channel? It makes people super angry. It's understandable why it's the most watched network in the States.
[5:03:52] BlueBeast33: Yeah but the way he worded it made it seem something more sinister, which isn't true
[5:04:15] rocthenite: asmongold is going to have a mental breakdown on stream, his duo account and how he is using it is a sign of him losing it
[5:04:17] Collected1: Ion etc engage but you can guarantee when they're sat around a table discussing youtube videos etc they get pissed off. It's inevitable.
[5:04:23] Justarandomman: ye @spaphytwitch i agree, don't see direct correspondence through email either
[5:04:33] LeonardLongNips: These dudes have to get hundreds of emails that shit on them. The fact that they decided to respond this one time? idk seems sketch
[5:04:33] GrumpyButts: @warrenny because that's not how companies talk to clients. The notion that you need to be a game developer to be able to criticique the game is the same as saying that you need to be a chef to critique food
[5:04:35] Enigmio: LUL
[5:04:42] Zander_TheGamer: I feel like there are two different kinds of WoW content creators. There are cool people like Towelliee who are real and just want to play WoW and have fun. Then you have people like Asmond and Bellular who trive on drama and just say shit to get clicks.
[5:04:46] belfastcl: from the same creator of you think you do but you dont
[5:04:47] elvia_: negative videos are watch twice as much than the positive videos on youtube @Towelliee so yeah they make money
[5:04:58] goofywizard: If you look at it from this standpoint, the game developers makes a game that they envision to share. They don't really have to listen to the community and tell them how to make the game. But what we can do is suggest what WOULD make game better
[5:04:59] Garrujak: All I'm saying is there's tons of people who watch you, Bajheera, and countless other wow streamers and don't become spergs. Is it any surprise Asmonfans tend to be toxic ragemonsters? He makes his own bed every day, and yet we're supposed to feel bad that he's not happy with a game he gets carried in?
[5:05:00] Knyte_Owl: I bet Ion hacked JAB‚Äôs email and responded with that!
[5:05:01] brain_wash: there are far stronger signs Asmond is losing it that have nothing to do with 2 twitch accts
[5:05:10] magemaster225: you think you had no content but you do
[5:05:13] HuntingTurtle: @Zander_TheGamer except asmon/bell have been some of the bigger supporters until recently
[5:05:20] DallasEmbers: I am so excited for TBC. Still need to find a guild to CatJam with and enjoy the content.
[5:05:22] Vexxsis: good thing most my time is in FF14 SeemsGood
[5:05:27] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: whatever, ASMG just gonna keep bitching anyway
[5:05:33] ChinnyD: @Zander_TheGamer do you know how much of the population agrees with what they are saying though? it's obviously much deeper than you give it credit
[5:05:44] kofijuve: What does JAB think about Rurikhan?
[5:05:47] RolexKT: Can GMs talk to players through email? Cause if they can then it's possible that's what happened
[5:05:52] rocthenite: @HuntingTurtle bell was unsub in bfa and barely get aootc when he plays
[5:05:58] S1appadabass: @Towelliee JAB about to put Asmon back on a 6 month vacation again
[5:06:05] Collected1: if its fake its the best fake i've seen. guy even went to the trouble of showing he was emailing daily before he eventually got a reply
[5:06:08] Rudric_Ice: whats your take on asmon's twit on WoW ?
[5:06:29] kofijuve: How many Pfiezers did u take Towelliee?
[5:06:31] Dirtnose: @Zander_TheGamer Do you know though? You're assuming it's a lot because why? Their viewers agree. Their viewers are like what? 5% of the games population? It's a potential echo chamber
[5:06:31] Zander_TheGamer: @Zander_TheGamer They agree cause they are blind lemmings and just believe what morons tell them. They can't think for themselves.
[5:06:33] idenkaz_: i mean if they want the playerbase to reduce itself to mythic + service game, hey you do you Blizzard
[5:06:35] verentnarv: just got here, what's fake chat?
[5:06:36] Arakai: He's not wrong about Bellular :)
[5:06:43] Garrujak: But that's the problem. Idiots suggest crap all the time and fill up the forums with nonsense. Is it any surprise no one at blizz wants to be paid to watch clickbait videos and sift through garbage forum posts?
[5:06:58] euthelol: majority of asmon viewers that hate WoW haven't played in years
[5:07:02] 91Niki: I'd also think, if it was fake, a CM would pop into the forum and be like "yeah that's fake, later" LUL
[5:07:02] CCG_337: wow community feels like they all are agin together, like alot of cranky gramopass having a argue in a haircut place.
[5:07:05] ChinnyD: we can't act like there isn't truth behind the criticisms. WoW development has taken a similar path to Overwatch. They just dont listen to the community anymore
[5:07:11] Reddevc: eh, the name drop makes it pretty targetted

[5:07:23] Syllvn: Using an email checker, the address it came from isn't correct.  For example the address from their email mailouts comes out as ok.   I believe it's fake.
[5:07:29] verentnarv: @collected1 thx
[5:07:38] Vexxsis: pretty sad you gotta explain something because other take it out of context
[5:07:44] mintcookie_vajankle: Bellular is just a typical journalist, you can't take him seriously, just acknowledge his news if you enjoy getting information that way over reading the posts yourself.
[5:07:44] rocthenite: the guy who made the email have a adgenda
[5:07:45] belfastcl: he talks about streamers that generate ire/profit from it, that doesn't encompass all streamers
[5:07:47] Collected1: yes

[5:07:50] beckett3a: yeah of course, it was directed at every streamer/yter critiquing sl
[5:07:50] Justarandomman: thing is, you and others don't really entice drama and anger.. so I wouldn't put you in that bracket lol
[5:07:53] idenkaz_: oh yeah
[5:07:53] 91Niki: Oh for sure
[5:08:04] fennecx25: it's fake, people are dumb so they do this ,ye
[5:08:13] sleeptime123: you could also say that it was another dismissive message sent to the community, like "you think you want it but you dont"
[5:08:15] Syllvn: You can press f12 and edit that code easily. It's super easy to fake.
[5:08:15] dillapuss: Slander
[5:08:16] Collected1: the guy even has his gmail account details in the screen shot
[5:08:22] dabirdman85: in print so its libel
[5:08:23] elvia_: so the writer of icy veins is fucked too
[5:08:24] NOS_4EVR: email address for JAB comes back legit
[5:08:27] 91Niki: Like said, if this was fake, at the very least a CM would pop in and shut it down, or worse
[5:08:31] theszoti: i don't think this is targeted to all streamers, i think he meant the people who cause drama all the time
[5:08:44] michaelmm: His email was in the response, that said it was a screenshot so I guess it could have been manipulated.
[5:08:51] DarthVapour420: both statements can be true. the faults streamers/community identification of issues in live. as well as what blizz says about streamers
[5:08:53] Aravarth: so wait, are we upset with JAB or do we side with JAB, I'm unsure who to sharpen my pitchforks against
[5:09:04] Thoreya: If it was actually real im glad JAB at least has a fucking spine
[5:09:05] Zaanthrax: what happened ? just woke up.. any link ?

[5:09:25] FranciscoTheMage: icy veins should NOT have published Jbrack's email address
[5:09:29] BoltsUp75: wanting the game to be good and not have so many convoluted systems that are only there to stretch out content because they are behind isnt necessarily negative, its more constructive
[5:09:34] NoWaayMan: towel have you gotten this seasons glad mount?
[5:09:34] DarthVapour420: okay i see. i agree üëç too
[5:09:38] Justarandomman: what happened to that long haired community manager? forgot his name
[5:09:39] broopyd: it's just not ballsy though, you think asmongold doesnt agree with it lol
[5:09:41] dabirdman85: just an ad hominem attack thought right?
[5:09:42] Justarandomman: used to stream too
[5:09:45] MuttonChopins: its on icy veins @Zaanthrax
[5:09:54] mintcookie_vajankle: Maybe it was JAB's secretary and she had a bad mother's day so she wrote out a nasty email reply.
[5:09:57] Garrujak: I hope it is true, because those particular streamers need a wakeup call. They're not more important that other people, nor do they know everything.
[5:09:59] LSBreed: God complex....
[5:09:59] idenkaz_: why would they care? it would imply they give a cookie about what streamers say.
[5:10:06] magemaster225: kinda rough to lump preach with asmon and bell
[5:10:14] 91Niki: @FranciscoTHEmage Odds are it's probably public somewhere anyway. It probably goes through a secretary anyway
[5:10:21] Shugaze: well Ion used to be just like those streamers before being the designer
[5:10:30] HaloS23: Thats what drives me nuts about Bellular, Preach, Asmon.... i cant stand that mentality
[5:10:41] Thaxus_1974: He apparently doesn't know that Bellular in fact IS a game designer.

[5:11:06] wdotk: i swear towelliee youre the only person that still speaks positively about blizzard and wow
[5:11:07] DarthVapour420: üòÜü§£ truth
[5:11:10] Garrujak: How many people play Bell's game(s) though?
[5:11:11] michaelmm: The premise of the request is that they should listen to preach, Asmon and Bellular as if they speak for the entire playerbase is IMO very flawed.
[5:11:14] D3m0nHunt3r666: we kinda see what type of content he watches
[5:11:15] honeychonker: Asmon literally said he doesn't envy the life of a developer though
[5:11:16] manmower: which PC games has he released?
[5:11:17] Aravarth: Wait, is Bellular a game designer? What has he published?
[5:11:18] Biorrwolf: How can we leave out WoWPeon or Metagoblin
[5:11:20] Dirtnose: @wdotk T&E
[5:11:21] fennecx25: preach is always the smartest..i stopped following him since his know it all attitude just baffles me every time xd
[5:11:22] Kinghorn: he is also a stock analyst

[5:11:24] FranciscoTheMage: belluar was a game designer? what did he work on?
[5:11:25] KinggKebab: Lets not talk about Bellular being a game designer until he's actually released something.
[5:11:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: no wonder his brain is half dead :v

[5:11:28] PidiaP: All those successful AAA games Bell has released Kappa

[5:11:30] rocthenite: god can you inmangin JAB or ion coming on allcraft, rich trying hard to be a edgy streamer, asmongold being like duuuuu and mcconnal in the corner want to yell at him to buff ret
[5:11:38] gidgeet: Preach is a bit of a drama queen though
[5:11:40] K_A_N_J_I: I like preach but he‚Äôs been making some questionable videos on unfinished systems to rant negatively about them. So I would see why he would be included @towelliee
[5:11:40] Rekrian: !song
[5:11:41] Garrujak: I make music at home, does that make me better than Jimi Hendrix and know how he could be better?
[5:11:58] 91Niki: Yep
[5:11:59] Collected1: i like it. i think more devs should speak out about it.
[5:12:01] Thoreya: Bell has a team developing his game. Which means he has an excuse to be a child and bash blizz developers because the game isn‚Äôt to his perfect liking
[5:12:04] 91Niki: Just remember the / spit in wow
[5:12:06] Thaxus_1974: Bellular is working on his first two games. I think his studio is called Coffeebox games.
[5:12:07] Thoreya: Miss me with that

[5:12:22] adrian_fell: happens in forums of irl politics aswell

[5:12:24] RolexKT: I don't really have an issue with *critiquing* they pretty much only focus on it
[5:12:26] michaelmm: I like Preach, Asomon and Bellular and often agree with them. But I very much doubt I would enjoy playing a game that was designed around what those three want!
[5:12:30] belfastcl: if you could see the critique people do the ESO devs, it's scathing
[5:12:33] Daganatv: CoD community has entered the chat
[5:12:35] Douggi3: People complain about COD all the time on stream
[5:12:42] elvia_: when people are bored in WoW, they have the time to critic, when they have something to play, no one is talking
[5:12:52] Garrujak: Wow is a uniquely toxic community though. A friend of mine quit Classic in a week and was baffled as an outsider when he saw how we treat eachother.
[5:13:05] Bernardo994: Bellular is making a game
[5:13:10] Biorrwolf: Society, amirite?
[5:13:12] Reddevc: I don't watch CoD streams, but I really struggle to imagine somebody has an 8+ hour stream dedicated to shitting on the game
[5:13:14] warrenny: @michaelmm Tbhon,y thing that puts me iff asmon is his fans
[5:13:22] mercethecurse: streamers proclaiming their opinions on game development is no different than the talking heads on Fox news. Drive viewership by catering to populist ideas
[5:13:22] GiraffeHydra_: binding your hearth costs a subscription Kappa
[5:13:26] Molvonos: I've permanently blocked seeing Bellular, Preach, and Asmon's content on Youtube and I feel infinitely more intelligent each passing day as a result.
[5:13:27] Bernardo994: dont know what it is but he is
[5:13:31] Kinghorn: the big classic servers are toxic but azuresong is mostly fine

[5:13:41] honeychonker: Still, if someone goes "hey, i agree with their opinion after hearing it" is that bad? Someone has to hold blizzard to account for the betterment of the game
[5:13:41] BlueBeast33: Designed maybe not, but I've heard great suggestions for the game from people like Preach
[5:13:43] K_A_N_J_I: Bellular making the next wow killer. Watch out.
[5:13:56] Daganatv: hahaha @K_A_N_J_I
[5:14:01] Vexxsis: @rocthenite  that's you'r opinion
[5:14:09] holmstroms: Just stay away from Server discords, and everything is fine
[5:14:16] Gruffian: When Bell puts out a successful game then everyone can defend his "game design" credentials. Until then he is just a content creator.
[5:14:20] honeychonker: People are missing the point. If this ISN'T fake, then blizzard are trying to shift blame onto other people for the state of their game
[5:14:40] rocthenite: @veox89 account to what, you made it sound like blizzerd commented a warcrime
[5:14:45] D3m0nHunt3r666: Thongus must be geared to the teeth :p
[5:14:47] holmstroms: @Gruffian So you have to be a game designer to critique a game that you play? :P
[5:14:50] PhoenixAuTv: I mean people don't have to be chief's to see the their steak is cooked wrong. So i welcome alot of criticism to blz at the moment to be fair.
[5:14:51] Aravarth: honestly, the most I want is for games released by Chris Metzen (Warchief Gaming) and Mike Morhaime (Dreamhaven)
[5:14:55] 91Niki: There is a difference between disliking a game, and actively trashing the game on your stream or social media, in front of 1000s of followers. You can dislike a game without being toxic. I don't like the state wow is in now, but I don't waste my day complaining about it.
[5:15:10] broopyd: I just wish Blizzard would take their own accountability for the state of their game, rather then trying to pass the blame and irate of a community onto "influeners" cringey af
[5:15:13] honeychonker: @veox89 To make the best product possible for their customers and stop treating us like idiots
[5:15:18] Gruffian: @holmstroms No but everyone is defending Bell as a game designer when he hasnt actually put anything out.
[5:15:21] net_mi: 5min wait after each pull? this guy is serial about wow
[5:15:36] Biorrwolf: Asmon, Preach, and Bell are all industry plants to act as scapegoats for Acti-Blizz? What? No way
[5:15:38] holmstroms: @Gruffian That I agree with!
[5:15:46] broopyd: @91Niki If the game was in such a good state, those 1000s of followers would disregard the influences opinion though.
[5:15:57] Thoreya: ^ that‚Äôs not true lol
[5:16:05] Thoreya: Hivemind mentality is absolutely a thing
[5:16:08] rocthenite: @BroopyD how does asmongold cum taste
[5:16:11] MuttonChopins: yeah if Bellular hasn't made a game at all he really isn't a game designer and is just basically a content creator
[5:16:17] Thoreya: Asmon can say the sky is red and his followers would believe it
[5:16:23] honeychonker: I think someone who has any amount of following has a right to state their opinion, regardless of what that opinion. They dont have some "moral obligation" to keep quiet because they are famous
[5:16:29] verentnarv: @broopyd I mean the dude who wrote the email, was the one who bring up those 3, blame that dude
[5:16:30] broopyd: @rocthenite LUL
[5:16:30] rocthenite: asmongold is going to have someone killed
[5:16:31] TheUnknowing: Yeah but that comment he made wasn't shifting complete blame onto them
[5:16:31] Garrujak: I wish certain influencers would stop sending their legions of trash fans to hate on a game dev because they can't decide on things for themselves
[5:16:41] flebbooo: yep your right
[5:16:43] codenicc: love your new shelves setup Towelliee !
[5:16:44] briefbreadfruit: just look at asmons chat
[5:16:44] spainard15: correct
[5:16:45] Bahamut145: 100%
[5:16:45] NOS_4EVR: true
[5:16:46] broopyd: @rocthenite the streamer you're subbed to just said he agrees with me, you're weird bro
[5:16:47] Shugaze: @BroopyD chill out theres some truth in there
[5:16:48] xXSiebzehnXx: BREAK YOURSELF UPON MY BODY -Neptulon
[5:16:50] MuttonChopins: Asmon's community is just toxic, Asmon as a person can be chill
[5:16:54] xiamrs: sperg mentality
[5:16:54] cordawg: wOULDNT be needed if Retail wasnt garbage.
[5:16:56] honeychonker: Someones you need mob mentality to enact change, for better or for worse. Not just in gaming.
[5:17:00] honeychonker: sometimes*
[5:17:03] Nozdub: Agreed Garrujak, it costs you nothing to just leave things you don't like alone. No need to create hate around it.
[5:17:03] Zander_TheGamer: The game is fine. It is just timing of the patch and COVID. If 9.1 came out two months ago no one would be saying the shit they are. It sucks but that is reality and the state of the world we are in.
[5:17:06] warrenny: Want proof of that read the forums
[5:17:07] Kainiee: did you see sloot's twitter about upcoming interview?
[5:17:08] GrayBush420: Stop saying us, you are not an influencer
[5:17:09] Biorrwolf: We all definitely shill for a good mob or conspiracy
[5:17:21] gonziav: People will repeat anything those guys shout in their streams
[5:17:22] Thoreya: @graybush420 lol
[5:17:22] Mecabeast: it's not like it's just video games it happens
[5:17:26] mercethecurse: I think both statements can be true. The game systems can be improved AND the constant negativity in the WoW content community is too much.
[5:17:26] LeonardLongNips: Most times I see those streamers specifically state don't go after developers/designers. After that the responsibility is on the fans not the streamer.
[5:17:27] Vexxsis: @tacovendor93 Asmon is toxic ...but Zack is a different person
[5:17:28] mintcookie_vajankle: WoW is mostly fine wholly as the game it is intended to be, there is endless amounts of content and the freedom to do whatever you wish for the most part. The state of the game is objective mostly and opinions are'nt to be taken literally. The game has flaws, but tell me what you think of ESO, LoTR, Old Republic, etc. 9 months first patch? Yeah sucks, but if thats what they gotta do whatever.
[5:17:32] rocthenite: @GrayBush420 then say that to asmongold and bell
[5:17:37] 91Niki: @BroopyD Not true. Cult / herd mentality is a thing. Because it's "cool" to hate on shit. Just look at cancel culture. It's the feeling of being part of a group, even if it's a group of people who don't give two shits about you, you are part of something. I can have a strong dislike about something, without being toxic about it.
[5:17:39] Deshio: I think thats where the problem is, when they rush to the forums to voice their opinions, most if not all feedback is ignored on things being developed.
[5:17:52] Mallaes: :V
[5:17:55] Biorrwolf: @graybush420 Close to 1 million followers seems fairly influential tho
[5:18:08] warrenny: @o_illusionz Nothing
[5:18:16] K_A_N_J_I: Influencers have an onlyfans

[5:18:18] Molvonos: Influencers want free shit without putting in any work, streamers put on a show.
[5:18:19] GrayBush420: @biorrwolf Lols at 1 million
[5:18:23] cordawg: They never do. Kappa
[5:18:24] MuttonChopins: Yeah I like his alt channel but with his alt channel getting more views it feels like his Asmon persona is getting to him there as well from what I saw last time @Vexxsis
[5:18:29] spainard15: Just like Classic relaunch with Soda, Asmon and the rest. The created a bad storm for getting ganked on a PVP server. And wanted blizz to help them and give them special treatment
[5:18:30] warrenny: Its entertainment for sure
[5:18:32] Aquadriel: people already believing these emails are legit. Why would JAB reply to a nobody ü§∑
[5:18:36] idenkaz_: these feedback post even when good and plausible will never reach the actual people who should ream them to begin with
[5:18:38] Garrujak: Asmon is the "orange man" of WoW. His followers worship the ground he walks on, and will go to any length to say he's right, even when he's wrong.
[5:18:40] Vexxsis: @tacovendor93  for sure
[5:18:41] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee I can tell you right now, that anyone who uses that dicks in salad line is 100% getting ignored by the devs LUL
[5:18:41] jkitchin75: @GrayBush420 nither are you bell
[5:18:44] bearforceone59: They should listen to it: they make a product for the consumers, the one's giving the feedback, not the other way around
[5:18:48] broopyd: @91Niki Herd mentality is definitely a thing sure, but you're telling me if the game was actually good the amount would be even compareable? deluded if you think so sorry
[5:18:52] Biorrwolf: @graybush420 OmG sToP iNcItInG iRe
[5:18:54] DelcoAF: Right, they dont listen to it and that's why they've been down 29% in e years.
[5:18:55] honeychonker: It's the fact it comes across as that feedback being ignored, then gaslighting us later on by saying "look! we added that feature a year later!" Thats the issue
[5:18:55] fennecx25: @garrujak i wouldn't agree with that
[5:19:04] 91Niki: @BroopyD It's totally okay to dislike something and being unhappy about a state of a game, but screaming about it online that: "THE GAME IS TRASH", doesn't do anything besides making you look like a toxic idiot ü§∑
[5:19:05] ChinnyD: @Garrujak thats a ridiculous comparison lmao come on man
[5:19:12] Shugaze: @Molvonos influencers do work to actually reach the visibility needed to get said free shit
[5:19:12] LeonardLongNips: I mean he isn't wrong. I bet they get 100s of hate emails from wow boys. Why respond to one person.
[5:19:21] broopyd: @91Niki the issue is the fact the game is in a terrible state, not only do you have that cancel culture group but also the average player who also thinks its shit too. theres a combination
[5:19:21] ChiefMango: @Towelliee one screenshot showed this person had spammed JAB each day with mails
[5:19:23] Molvonos: @HBsumo lolol
[5:19:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: shows that he is confident in his employees
[5:19:36] Zaanthrax: i dont think the issue is about acting on feedback, the fact they ignore the playerbase and have close to 0 communication as to WHY they dont agree with the feedback is part of the problem
[5:19:37] PvtHudson093: i dont like the we will fix the 9.0 issue in 9.2 or 9.3
[5:19:50] Biorrwolf: Can't wait to see a notification for "AsmonReacts" on my YouTube now -.-
[5:19:58] manmower: they should hire some community managers
[5:20:01] Collected1: like i said earlier if it's a fake it's very well executed
[5:20:02] EthicalHermit: I mean, spam filter auto sorts 99% of his e-mail I bet
[5:20:08] MuttonChopins: I'm surprise JAB replied back, I would be more surprise if Bobby Kotick replied back
[5:20:09] Shugaze: nice reply
[5:20:09] flebbooo: LUL
[5:20:10] blade_killa: LUL
[5:20:11] honeychonker: lol it was Pepsi Max
[5:20:12] gonziav: THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
[5:20:12] Vexxsis: LUL coke zero
[5:20:13] Blvdman: LUL
[5:20:15] HaxzorJimDuggan: his email is about to blow up now though
[5:20:16] K_A_N_J_I: Mark it as junk
[5:20:16] Aro725: Slamming that pepsi max lmfao
[5:20:17] fennecx25: LUL
[5:20:19] DrakhanGaming: pepsi max
[5:20:21] daniel85mg: LUL
[5:20:22] Mecabeast: the coke zero video are my fav lol
[5:20:25] DelcoAF: Executives get emails like that filtered out... you think Tim Cook or Elon Musk just get emailed from random's every day????
[5:20:25] 91Niki: @BroopyD I never said that. Just saying that being toxic with a big platform creates more toxic people. You can think a game is in a shitty state without being toxic about it. Constructive criticism is a thing you know.
[5:20:26] PidiaP: Pepsi Max
[5:20:26] TheUnknowing: Bellulars next title 'BLIZZARD HATES ME'
[5:20:29] snorkle0: I bet it wasn't just pepsi LUL
[5:20:39] manmower: stand back J, let me tell you about all my expert game making
[5:20:42] LeonardLongNips: I can't see how a random fans email gets through all the email depositories/filters.
[5:20:42] Biorrwolf: Hi Towelliee, the new room looks pretty fire. We're all really happy for you and the upgrade VoHiYo
[5:20:47] DrakhanGaming: emptied out pepsi max can filled with whiskey
[5:20:49] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee you see the new taliesin video where he whipped out the pepsi max?
[5:20:54] Osowareru: damn what did i miss? can someone explain
[5:20:54] Bombayshow: I blame tik tok
[5:20:56] Wildside1177: That was awesome
[5:20:58] broopyd: @91Niki Sure, because construction criticism and Blizzard have gone hand in hand for years Kappa
[5:20:59] DarthVapour420: it was awesome
[5:21:01] Blvdman: LOOOL
[5:21:03] flebbooo: So good LUL
[5:21:04] Aquadriel: that was hilarious, what a jab LUL
[5:21:07] TacoTime_Gaming: pepsi max lol
[5:21:08] Wildside1177: Ferocious
[5:21:09] Lamgwin: saw that. brillliant
[5:21:09] daniel85mg: LOL
[5:21:11] TacoTime_Gaming: not coke zero
[5:21:14] warrenny: Love ut
[5:21:21] honeychonker: I think the main issue is there seems to be an "us vs them" atmosphere, when we want to work with blizz to get the game we want and make it better
[5:21:28] D3m0nHunt3r666: The coke detail was lit
[5:21:34] verentnarv: @towelliee I think another problem wow has in the development cycle is they push back fixes and stuff to systems in the game until all the things in the patch are finish, just to keep the .1. .2 .3 etc patch cycle, they need to stop doing that and do smaller patch with some fixes like they used to do
[5:21:37] 91Niki: @BroopyD Trust me, Blizzard reads constructive criticism. They don't have to agree with it, but they read it. Unless spergs spamming "FIX THE GAME"
[5:21:41] Aravarth: nothing wrong with wanting to be paid TBH
[5:21:46] xecksi: diet dr pepper is the best.
[5:21:46] 91Niki: Unlike *
[5:21:47] Aravarth: why do something for free if people will pay you for it
[5:21:47] Zander_TheGamer: Best thing JAB every did was the "30 years is.......so many years"
[5:22:01] Chiraakitteh: @zaanthrax See, this demand that they act on feedback by the people making it is part of the problem. Devs don‚Äôt 'ignore' feedback just because they don‚Äôt happen to implement the feedback YOU support.

[5:22:08] Bombayshow: the game that 1 million people want
[5:22:09] Bombayshow: LUL
[5:22:10] DarthVapour420: it boils down to us telling them how to do their job
[5:22:10] Vexxsis: "want" like a spoiled little shit
[5:22:17] GTmask: "We" LUL
[5:22:18] Ezekyler: Pepsi, the officlal drink of Mac Dowell's Zamunda Kappa
[5:22:19] TheUnknowing: It's not about what we want, in the end its about what blizzard wants unfortunately.
[5:22:22] Shugaze: issue now is the customers are figthing each other, simps vs haters, and blizz just enabled it today
[5:22:23] 91Niki: Exactly
[5:22:25] broopyd: @91Niki Listening to constructive criticism is irrelevant if they dont do anything with it
[5:22:28] Bombayshow: I dont want mythic+ what now ?
[5:22:30] Bombayshow: LUL
[5:22:33] Goblinemporium: They wouldn't make money with a game we wanted LuL
[5:22:34] bearforceone59: @DarthVapour420 But their literal job is to make the community happy
[5:22:36] Molvonos: @HBsumo Explain.
[5:22:43] Aravarth: Council? SASHAY LEFT
[5:22:43] TacoTime_Gaming: Wow just needs to stop with the borrowed power.
[5:22:44] 91Niki: @BroopyD Just listen to what Towelliee is saying right now. People gotta get their head out of the gutter
[5:22:52] Zaanthrax: dude blizz devs are the worst at having a dialogue with their community, look at other games constantly updating playerbase on twitter
[5:22:53] honeychonker: Sure, but "we" are the customers, there is a middle ground somewhere instead of blizzard just saying "this is how its going to be"
[5:22:57] raldrik: It is the difference between being heard and being followed. Blizzard heres us. They cant just do everything everyone wants
[5:22:58] Shugaze: @Molvonos like a great man said just 2mins ago, lololol
[5:23:00] warrenny: @broopyd They do ppl just disagree
[5:23:00] Blvdman: Question: Does that mean the 40% playerbase drop post fake?
[5:23:03] Deshio: Sorry, had to think if a good response about the forums. I think you are correct. They do read what is posted, its more the timeliness of them acting on it. It always seems too late and its things that are being directly pointed at in betas and alphas taking until x.2 or x.3 to be fixed. A good example is the corruption vendor, and I can potentially foresee Conduit Energy being another to add to that list.
[5:23:06] flebbooo: ngl, i got kinda riled up after Asmon wrote that twitlonger about the game. But now i realise i've difiently been having way to much wishful thinking and just not good critism
[5:23:07] Zaanthrax: nobody is saying they need to act on every comment, but give us something
[5:23:10] DelcoAF: agree with you there. Tesla makes THEIR car and people buy it. They do market research and if there is something that a lot of people feel passionate about, the make the change if it's economical.
[5:23:12] KinggKebab: All these people shitting on wow but still logging onto it daily. I feel like you can make your suggestion/point without ranting about it daily.
[5:23:16] warrenny: @broopyd also ppl will cry no matter what blizz do
[5:23:22] idenkaz_: conduit energy "too many opinions" 4Head
[5:23:28] PvtHudson093: But people gave lots of feedback and we still got Azerite Armour that wasnt good till 8.1 and no corruption vendor till months after it was needed
[5:23:28] Enigmio: they gathering the wrong feedback, thats the problem
[5:23:35] CrusaderNero: bro its a game LUL
[5:23:35] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:23:39] 91Niki: @warrenny Exactly. Can never please everyone. That's just reality
[5:23:40] Vexxsis: yup
[5:23:42] DarthVapour420: @bearforceone59 unfortunately it's not. it's a happy byproduct when it does. but their job is to produce a product that's profitable. that's it.
[5:23:55] TacoTime_Gaming: Borrowed powered makes alts a pain.
[5:23:57] justlnquisitive: @rocthenite To be fair, KJ worked on Tyranny and that came out in 2016. LUL
[5:24:05] honeychonker: But who ARE they catering too then, given the current state of the game?
[5:24:08] Biorrwolf: @kinggkebab are you suggesting we invest in a hobby in a wholesome manner, or even have hobbies outside of WoW? Because that's asking a lot
[5:24:11] Stupotty19: But can we all agree that conduit energy is the worst rooThink
[5:24:15] ChinnyD: is it not up to the community management to listen to the community and weigh out what people say to determine what they think the playerbase wants??

[5:25:47] 91Niki: @warrenny That's awesome ! I'm happy for you that you're having a good time playing :D
[5:25:50] K_A_N_J_I: The issue is streamers and content creators use those key words like ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúthe community‚Äù. When in fact they are speaking about their echo chamber as 2k people in your chat does not accurately represent the whole community. Then they can use a content drought to back up their argument as proof. @towelliee
[5:25:51] Biorrwolf: @kinggkebab OMG way to take the moral highground >.>
[5:25:52] Vumbra: he responded where?
[5:25:53] zildrog: he tweeted on his alt account
[5:26:02] flyingbufanda: what is the tweet?
[5:26:04] Zander_TheGamer: I honestly sperate you and them
[5:26:05] flyingbufanda: please link
[5:26:08] PhillyDilly18: It is still there, just not listed on the home page I think.
[5:26:09] froodyo: They took it down
[5:26:14] flyingbufanda: sadge

[5:26:26] eruditecuck: I think Asmongold speaks for a lot of people to be fair
[5:26:35] snuffles_80: we can give advice but in the end its Blizzards game.. dont like it? dont play
[5:26:36] BlueBeast33: Icy Veins deleted the tweet @Towelliee
[5:26:37] elvia_: @rocthenite too far mate
[5:26:37] belfastcl: @rocthenite that's a dumb thing to say
[5:26:38] Kinghorn: a stretch rocthenite
[5:26:42] Broomba: @eruditecuck Asmon doesnt speak for me
[5:26:47] Aquadriel: eruditecuck he speaks for himself
[5:26:51] Chiraakitteh: No matter what the devs add or remove from the game, SOMEONE is going to love it or hate it on the internet... there is zero in-between there. It‚Äôs only one extreme or the other, because most folks on the internet can‚Äôt actually have a reasonable conversation about something if it doesn‚Äôt go their way.
[5:26:56] Vexiusx: Asmongold just went live on twitch :O
[5:27:00] TheUnknowing: Asmon's idea of what he wants the game to be isn't the same as every one else, he doesn't want to make it better for every one, he wants it for himself.
[5:27:01] Vexiusx: On his alt account zackrawrr
[5:27:02] Vexxsis: everyone does but doesn't mean it will work
[5:27:11] 91Niki: Guys, we can have a conversation without insulting each other. If you can't, I will hit you with the ban hammer
[5:27:11] belfastcl: but from the fact that a streamer doesn't speak for everybody, doesn't mean it doesn't speak for anyone
[5:27:14] Gruffian: @eruditecuck He speaks for a lot of people because he says "this sucks" and all his fans then say "yeah this DOES suck"
[5:27:22] geokouts: I am gonna make my own game with Black-Jack and Hookers. Infact forget the Black-Jack :P
[5:27:27] Zaanthrax: well, QOL changes should not be something that a player should ask for making you do the same content over and over again tends to make people swap games in my experience
[5:27:37] Bombayshow: Gruffian that mostly every wow streamer LUL
[5:27:43] ChinnyD: community managers?

[5:27:54] lucaniusTV: @towelliee where did u get ur UI
[5:27:55] eruditecuck: @eruditecuck thats pretty much it he says what everyone thinks sucks
[5:27:58] Zaanthrax: they did exactly this in 8.3 with corruptions, now they did it with the venari rep/soul ash, they just keep doing ti really
[5:27:59] Gruffian: @Bombayshow Totally agree.
[5:28:00] zaeden8: tru
[5:28:01] Dus7in: by and large though, blizzard has adopted the mindset "You think you do, but you don't" When in fact that couldn't have been more wrong. It wasn't until they realized how much money they were losing did they give us classic.
[5:28:06] GiraffeHydra_: If its anonymous, they'd speak true most likely
[5:28:07] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: totally
[5:28:10] honeychonker: Why dont blizzard do more surveys then? More focus groups? More open discussions?
[5:28:13] Garrujak: Most people piggyback on hate or disdain because they have other things they dislike, and they believe they can stir change by spreading rage and hate in general
[5:28:24] PvtHudson093: But wasnt feedback given about Azerite Armour in alpha/beta and it still went ahead
[5:28:37] lucaniusTV: !ui

[5:28:46] Redpandalol: @towelliee it just feels like we are shouting into the void
[5:28:48] 91Niki: Yep. Herd mentality at it's finest
[5:28:48] Boccardo316: Most people not even played the game
[5:28:51] Aravarth: I mean, there's whole industries of business research which conduct focus group interviews (same as in politics). Do people honestly think Blizzard didn't do this market research?
[5:28:52] holmstroms: I'm struggling a bit with this logic :P
[5:28:53] Garrujak: It's like a bill in the government, one guy goes "well I don't like A, so lets change it" and the other guy says "I agree, lets change B while we're at it too" just so they can change the one thing they want
[5:28:55] KinggKebab: @Towelliee How do you suppose they'd deal with things if Asmons viewers wanted this, then preaches group wanted something else, that if Blizz gave both of them what they wanted, that they'd actually be happy? 1. it'd probably ruin the game for others and 2. they'd just find something else to complain about
[5:28:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: they signed because they thought it was a giveaway LUL
[5:28:59] eruditecuck: i mean no one gets 'told' to do anything but sometimes a streamer might convince them, they arent mindless sheep
[5:29:14] Bombayshow: Tradechat must be rofl right now LUL
[5:29:18] daniel85mg: That's why ppl use the world influencers
[5:29:22] honeychonker: But to play devil's advocate, how many people are dismissing streamer's opinions just because they hate them?
[5:29:28] Thoreya: Remember we thought they‚Äôd never get rid of titanforging/multiboxing/artifact power and they actually did. They do listen to some stuff. Just not everything
[5:29:30] Exodeo_: I can't find it on icyveins anymore though
[5:29:39] abruptdecayO_O: who is the person emailing Brack in the chain? why would the president of Blizzard respond to this person
[5:29:45] Howitzer1028: I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with using a platform to discuss what you view is wrong with the game. Who is conduit energy benefitting nobody
[5:29:45] froodyo: Icyveins took the post down.
[5:29:50] Riddert__: Hey towelliee dorkiHey dorkiHey
[5:29:56] CrusaderNero: OFC its fake
[5:29:57] Collected1: it depends. perhaps the original email singled those people out.
[5:29:59] LeonardLongNips: It just seems a bit unprofessional coming from a president of a huge company.
[5:30:03] PvtHudson093: Content creators keep the game alive by showing off how fun it can be
[5:30:05] toocheap2rhyme: how you gonna be mad at someone defending himself
[5:30:05] Maldor313: it was fake surelly
[5:30:09] Thoreya: Prob told
[5:30:18] abruptdecayO_O: why would the president of blizzard reply to a rando dude
[5:30:25] RageerPLZ: wtf is happening?
[5:30:27] AverageGamingGamer: can someone @ me what this conversation is about
[5:30:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: he gonna have to change his email address now LUL
[5:30:30] Thoreya: At least it shows us that he cares LUL LUL
[5:30:31] PokerFaceMoose: i dont think he was doing that. i think he was just saying that they dont do what the streamers say because they complain to make money
[5:30:35] adrian_fell: They just took it down on icy veins
[5:30:37] Thoreya: He has a fucking spine! Good
[5:30:38] Collected1: the original email singled those people out  (https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/uploads/monthly_2021_05/heLRZiJ.png.73975e1af0efecd15a962359356cabf0.png)
[5:30:41] toocheap2rhyme: LUL
[5:30:41] 91Niki: @Towelliee I mean, true. But content creators like you, can choose your way to communicate your dislike to a game. Like you do it in a very mature way... unlike others who choose the toxic path.
[5:30:46] justlnquisitive: My account got hacked Kappa
[5:30:47] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: me ?! :)
[5:30:47] geokouts: wink wink. nudge nudge
[5:30:47] Thoreya: :)
[5:30:51] toocheap2rhyme: bad PR
[5:30:56] DelcoAF: Not real... executives like that do not respond to some randoms. They dont even get the emails.
[5:30:57] Mecabeast: pr team doing their job prob
[5:30:57] Gruffian: The real post from JAB is going to be even more ruthless. Watch out.
[5:30:58] 91Niki: I still see it?
[5:31:02] AudioJaq: I wouldn‚Äôt put you in the category of Asmon- he‚Äôs in his own cloud. I feel like you and Preach approach this honestly with different perspectives mind you. Bellular is in it for the clicks.
[5:31:04] 91Niki: I refreshed and it's still there
[5:31:05] toocheap2rhyme: you dont poke the hornets nest and not expect to get stung
[5:31:07] BlueBeast33: It's out there now so it's too late
[5:31:07] Sielu11628: Asmongold hopes it's real. He said it "shows they care".
[5:31:17] 91Niki: Oh now it's gone LOL
[5:31:18] justlnquisitive: monkaS
[5:31:22] hgizaira: it's definitely fake
[5:31:28] belfastcl: I think what you can get from streamer communities is general statements about what they like and dislike, though the reasons behind those statements usually vary
[5:31:29] Collected1: i think its real
[5:31:34] Collected1: if its fake its the best fake ive seen in a while
[5:31:40] Thoreya: I‚Äôll put $500 monopoly dollars down it‚Äôs real
[5:31:45] Bombayshow: People should quit twitter LUL
[5:31:45] D3m0nHunt3r666: its decent
[5:31:45] HyoonKang: its not fake
[5:31:47] Thoreya: Blizz gets leaked all the time
[5:31:52] LeonardLongNips: Its not hard to fake that type of stuff. You can easily change the code.
[5:31:55] luckfore: if its fake the guy is really gonna regret it
[5:31:57] toocheap2rhyme: LUL
[5:31:57] Aquadriel: if its real, they spreading personal info. If its fake, its defamation. Either way is fucked up
[5:32:01] Broomba: this is getting interesting.... tbc soon, 9.1 soon, juicy emails
[5:32:08] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, is it really that hard to fake a SS of an email
[5:32:13] bumpstock75: I hope its real....it means blizzard is watching.
[5:32:20] toocheap2rhyme: one of us, one of us
[5:32:36] Chibs243: Drunk email sold as fake
[5:32:36] Thoreya: At least JAB has ions back
[5:32:37] Aro725: I dont think its personal info leaked when his email is on their website. Sooo.... anyone could email him anyways
[5:32:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: hopefully if it is fake the guy didnt use his WoW email address because I smell a ban LUL
[5:32:40] Kainiee: does the "zap guy" still work for blizzard? chilton i think his name is
[5:32:41] Ramrocc: like 69 years
[5:32:42] Thoreya: Thatd good at least
[5:32:43] kofijuve: you are forgeting players changed MMO in the past, Alex had an enormous impact on Everquest
[5:32:44] Mecabeast: preraid bis weapons for orc were axe of the deep woods/frostbite and flurry axe both are boes and frostbite is from av
[5:32:57] DelcoAF: But I dont even think emails like that get to him from random people.
[5:33:00] Collected1: especially if thats is battlenet account
[5:33:09] LeonardLongNips: It just doesn
[5:33:09] TheGaoSora: "Whose that influencer!?!?"
[5:33:11] holmstroms: If he is american, sure. But that isn't a given :P
[5:33:16] ArcaneSyntax: Frostbite requires revered does it?
[5:33:22] DelcoAF: could you imagine elon musk getting emails every day from random people? His inbox would be destroyed.
[5:33:24] ellasky: Have you seen Bellular's latest vid?
[5:33:25] Collected1: guy will be posting in 5 years "how come i never get invited to betas"
[5:33:27] warrenny: @collected1 permaban
[5:33:28] Bombayshow: no one get called for defamation in 2021 LUL
[5:33:40] jkitchin75: ok what happend
[5:33:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:33:48] Shongoshi: how much stuff is there to do in TBC prepatch ? not including the new race / class? I know there is tabart but anything else?
[5:33:49] LeonardLongNips: It just doesn't seem real. I can't see a random dudes email getting through business email filters/designations all the way to the president.
[5:34:10] abruptdecayO_O: you can grind bgs for some decent levelling gear @Shongoshi
[5:34:41] Aquadriel: 1. JAB has no reason to reply to a guy like that. 2, JAB is way more eloquent and well spoken than what email shows.
[5:34:59] Deshio: Does anyone know how much quicker leveling will be on average post Prepatch?
[5:35:04] 91Niki: LUL
[5:35:05] Ramrocc: the skips take as long as going the normal way and killing the mobs
[5:35:09] Aquadriel: AND HE WAS RIGHT KEKW
[5:35:13] PvtHudson093: LUL
[5:35:16] Thoreya: JAB doesn‚Äôt give a fuck
[5:35:33] Calphurnious: He needed to speak our language for us to understand that's why
[5:35:33] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢
[5:35:34] warrenny: Thats still a meme üòÇ
[5:35:35] onyx_pupper: its not that hard. i was in a hospital that was treating my partner poorly while he was there for emergency surgery. one email to the ceo and had people there every 10 mins
[5:35:47] Deusey: Colts sign Eric Fisher
[5:35:49] ArcaneSyntax: To be fair, he was right when they said that and if he wrote that email he was also correct.
[5:35:50] VictorAvalanche: Lmao boost have nothing to do with mara boosting
[5:35:51] jalloppy: if the JAB thing is real, he's not wrong. streamers are financially incentivized to talk shit because negativity drives traffic and engagement.
[5:36:21] magemaster225: icyveins wanted to hit that click quota
[5:36:29] Stars_Eternall: i wonder if it is fake if hes just sat there thinking i didnt write this but i agree tho
[5:36:31] verentnarv: @onyx_pupper poorly in what way? is not the only patient
[5:36:49] GiraffeHydra_: but negative probably does drive more than positive
[5:36:51] MuttonChopins: negative stuff gets more highlighted than the positive
[5:36:55] Bombayshow: there is a lot of overpositive streamers too true
[5:36:57] onyx_pupper: @varienus botched tonsil surgery and was bleeding down his throat and they had him in the waiting room
[5:36:59] Collected1: yeah there's balanced opinion out there. this channel. sloot. T&E.
[5:37:02] Shugaze: Bellular been the positive andy for wow for a while and only now he gets a bit negative and he gets trashed on
[5:37:26] jalloppy: @Towelliee right, but you can't tell me that the negativity doesn't vastly outweigh a positive mindset. especially with Asmon, who has long been on the "LFR and store mounts ruined my game!" crusade
[5:37:28] TheGaoSora: Drama > Content
[5:37:28] holmstroms: @HBsumo Exactly
[5:37:33] sagethemage40: That‚Äôs. Community issue then
[5:37:35] Vexxsis: @hbsumo noticed that also
[5:37:50] gangman357: question for @chat and @Towelliee is Holy Pally gonna be a viable healer for pvp and DGs?
[5:37:50] Collected1: Towelliee : those people were named in the original email
[5:37:52] PvtHudson093: Preach is branching out in to variety content
[5:37:54] Bombayshow: people just hate everything since 2016 trend will go out soon
[5:37:54] belfastcl: perhaps J allen only knows preach from his criticism, and the question grouped him with the other two
[5:37:57] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee didn't he do an interview recently? probably just one of the first names that came to mind
[5:38:00] Vexxsis: Bell always been a pretty positive person on wow
[5:38:03] maccaruso: What the balls are we talking about? What went down?
[5:38:14] 91Niki: Asmongold being animated is an understatement LUL
[5:38:18] Aquadriel: But JAB didnt mention their names, hejust adressed the question which included the names.
[5:38:20] jalloppy: @Vexxsis that's just not true, man. i'm sorry.
[5:38:24] DrakhanGaming: LUL
[5:38:29] magemaster225: preach and bell need to drink dr. pepper instead of pepsi max
[5:38:31] wolvepg: Asmongold 2 is plating a garden right now
[5:38:32] Oriion_: Asmongold streaming on seperate account that bloke is so far cooked..
[5:38:35] gangman357: question for @chat and @Towelliee is Holy Pally gonna be a viable healer for pvp and DGs? in buring crusade that is
[5:38:37] Vexxsis: @jalloppy ok Debby downer
[5:38:44] kofijuve: why are u shitting on Asmon, he is just expresing his opinion dude, no need to be rude
[5:38:55] Bombayshow: asmon moslty the jake paul of wow
[5:39:07] Vexxsis: @bombayshow lol
[5:39:14] toffeeswirl: I used to like Bellular's vidoes but when he got super negative and click baity I stopped watching
[5:39:16] Garrujak: @kofijuve because his "opinion expression" is mostly just shitting on everyone else

[5:39:26] MagicHoof: @Maccaruso take a look at the last tweet at Towelliee's
[5:39:28] Vexxsis: @bombayshow that's pretty good
[5:39:31] 91Niki: Nope
[5:39:32] dalaraz: @kofijuve he also lies a lot for content too though
[5:39:32] Boccardo316: No
[5:39:34] Bruhnders: @Oriion_ Ajjajaj you are if you cant see thru his two characters
[5:39:34] kofijuve: I have never heard Asmon said anything bad about Towelliee
[5:39:35] MuttonChopins: Asmon used to seem pretty chill in his alt account but when he has more viewers he keeps going back to his persona
[5:39:36] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: nope
[5:39:40] verentnarv: @kofijuve he suits on anyone who doesn't support his opinion
[5:39:42] Vexxsis: BLIND
[5:39:43] Boccardo316: He overreacts for sure
[5:39:43] Bombayshow: saying facts REEEEEEEEEE
[5:39:46] Boccardo316: For content
[5:39:46] jalloppy: @Vexxsis the proof is in the pudding. go look at his channel and check out the traffic on positive spins versus negative ones. he's quite literally making more money to complain about things in the game. he's *financially incentivized* to do so. he hasn't been positive about the game in a very long time
[5:39:49] Kinghorn: towBlind
[5:39:50] FresheFefe: true
[5:39:51] Pbazza117: Is Penance for priests in TBC?
[5:39:52] warrenny: @tacovendor93 His character
[5:39:52] LeonardLongNips: I don't really watch Asmon much, but who cares if he talks shit. Its his channel.
[5:39:53] tonyr23: how did you get your sound proof foam pads to stick to the wall @towelliee
[5:39:54] 91Niki: @kofijuve Nobody is saying anything bad about anyone. Just stating the obvious :LUL
[5:39:57] 91Niki: LUL *
[5:39:58] HotFlakesTom: Well thats Asmon's character on stream.
[5:39:59] 770Cash: Im all for criticism but incessant ranting is annoying
[5:40:07] SpectralExa: His post was completely unprofessional and IMO ruins the valid credibility.
[5:40:18] Chibs243: Asmon has a large following to entertain
[5:40:22] DelcoAF: it's not him
[5:40:25] Templexx: all while mostly spewing facts
[5:40:27] Boccardo316: Asmongold video saying TBC is dead bla bla actually got him almost 800k views
[5:40:29] Bruhnders: wehere did j allen say anything
[5:40:33] Nutsy: Wait has J allen brack wage in on the negative community feedback?
[5:40:34] kofijuve: Why can't we just get along?
[5:40:38] DarthVapour420: it's a shame cuz it waters down the validity of some of the very valid criticism.
[5:40:44] Garrujak: You also can't spend all day meme'ing and shitting on everything then go "serious time bois" and expect people to take what you say seriously
[5:40:46] Vexxsis: @jalloppy I watch his videos alot , he's been pretty positive on wow but now he get negative and ppl jump down his throat.. anything else? i
[5:40:53] 91Niki: @kofijuve Nobody is fighting tho. Chill dude :P
[5:40:57] CrusaderNero: wow is okish, but its not meant to be played all day everyday anymore
[5:40:58] fennecx25: ofc
[5:40:59] jkitchin75: @the_brazilian_runner and
[5:41:07] MagicHoof: @Nutsy Towelliee's last tweet will explain
[5:41:16] verentnarv: @crusadernero exactly
[5:41:18] Malnar1123: They're designing the game to maximize profits, how can they call out content creators for designing their content to do the same?
[5:41:28] fennecx25: and I think preach is the one who doesn't understand that the most. what he says is not what most people want
[5:41:29] holmstroms: Sounds like an easy way for JAB to discredit the opinions of people with large followings. As if having a large following somehow means your opinions aren't your own, but only stated for views and "clout"
[5:41:37] pawiq: @Towelliee I like Asmon very much, but he is super negative for TBC, main rant was character clone 35 bucks is too high, 15-20 would be OK. Very little ppl will use it and 15 usd wont matter to most ppl
[5:41:37] Asterisix: @Towelliee  can you warrior charge when in combat in TBC?
[5:41:43] jalloppy: @Vexxsis i mean... this isn't true. look at his channel and look at traffic in content. he hasn't been "pretty positive", he's been ranty and negative because the analytics told him to be so
[5:41:45] magemaster225: Switching gears a little, what kind of updates/new info could we get from sloot's interview tomorrow
[5:41:48] Boccardo316: @jkitchin75 just stating that his rants get him a lot of views. Not criticizing or anything, just an observation
[5:41:49] SpectralExa: @Towelliee Agree 100%.
[5:41:56] DrakhanGaming: "sorry, that was patricia talking"
[5:41:59] 91Niki: It's like preaching positivity and turning around and being a toxic brat. It just doesn't work that way LUL
[5:42:04] DarthVapour420: @51nocaster that's a pretty fair statement üëå

[5:42:34] kofijuve: Yes, but Asmongold has like 120k viewers on release date, so he can do that tbh.
[5:42:42] Malnar1123: @varienus im not saying they dont. But not all companies call out their free marketing creators for having an opinion
[5:42:45] CantHealz: does @towelliee know icey took the post down?
[5:42:47] Molvonos: @kofijuve lolno.
[5:42:48] Boccardo316: @jkitchin75 true
[5:42:48] Sodbox: sumLove nickmercsLOVE chairhL knutL <3
[5:42:49] DelcoAF: lol dude is on now planting flowers... 10.3k viewers lol
[5:42:50] jalloppy: @Vexxsis lol, man i am calm. it's just annoying to see people say things like "bellular has been positive about the game" when he's been one of the most negative people about the game for a long time for finances. it's irritating, y'know?
[5:42:55] goofywizard: tbh though the main channel is just a persona but he does say like halfway says what he believes lol
[5:42:55] froodyo: ZackRawr is logging in
[5:42:58] froodyo: oh boy lol
[5:42:59] Garrujak: Sure he CAN do that, but Blizz won't listen to him on anything, which is why he's whining every day
[5:43:09] honeychonker: People can choose to listen to someone or they can choose not to. They can agree or disagree.
[5:43:23] Calphurnious: You were right on the money too calling him out when asmon always says speak with your wallet and and him staying subbed.
[5:43:25] Chibs243: Let‚Äôs be honest, wow isn‚Äôt in a good place atm. Much of the ‚Äúshit talk‚Äù is warranted.
[5:43:30] goofywizard: and he kind has too do that because of the views he's getting. Who wouldnt do that to main those views?
[5:43:30] dianthusnemo: Responsibility  goes beyond yourself
[5:43:33] Garrujak: To put it simply: you can't start a fist fight in the morning, then be a pacifist by night
[5:43:35] LeonardLongNips: Eh the viewers choose to watch. The onus falls on the them
[5:43:41] DelcoAF: zackrawrr is on planting flowers with 10.3k viewers just watching that lol people need things to do...
[5:43:41] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[5:43:41] dalaraz: @veox89 people agreeing for the wrong reasons is the problem :p
[5:43:48] 91Niki: @LeonardLongNips Amen
[5:43:55] Malnar1123: It's not black and white...Asmongold can be right about a lot of stuff and still benefit from negativity
[5:44:02] Vexxsis: @jalloppy WutFace
[5:44:03] goofywizard: and its the viewers responsibility to take it upon themselves to listen or not
[5:44:03] Bruhnders: i know the best for the game, they should hire me to make every descicion
[5:44:06] 91Niki: @Garrujak Amen!
[5:44:11] 91Niki: @LeonardLongNips Wrong tag LUL
[5:44:12] Aquadriel: @Towelliee Its like the whole /spit thing. He made thousands of people do /spit on people who bought a store mount in game and social media.
[5:44:14] Molvonos: And people who enjoy Asmon, here, have explicitly stated 'the community's  toxic, but he isn't.'  Yea, no, that logic doesnt work.
[5:44:26] honeychonker: Doesn't change the fact that a lot of people are either playing MUCH less than they want to, or not playing at all. That's the issue. Shifting the blame onto popular figures is hiding the real issue here
[5:44:39] Jackovitch: Jackovitch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! cheers :D
[5:44:46] goofywizard: @veox89 exactly
[5:44:46] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:44:53] RageerPLZ: streamers can also be called "shit disturbers" and they are very good at it and it can drive them
[5:44:59] fennecx25: @molvonos he is toxic but he is not dumb, most of his viewers are kids that are just plain stupid. that's it
[5:45:00] goofywizard: @veox89 shifting the blame
[5:45:07] jkitchin75: so what did jab say i missed it
[5:45:12] LeonardLongNips: You also can't tell someone that they can't express their opinion because they have viewers that watch them. Especially when they caveat it with, "Don't attack the devs/designers"
[5:45:19] Garrujak: The sad reality is that social media is like that nowadays: people react to outrage, but all want to be absolved of any responsibility for their words or actions.
[5:45:25] CantHealz: @towelliee Icey already deleted the post so not likely true
[5:45:25] Broomba: take responsibility but more importantly realize that your actions and words have consequences.
[5:45:26] Bruhnders: What did he say`? link pm?`?
[5:45:26] D3m0nHunt3r666: LUL
[5:45:28] sathreindis: what the hell happen guys Oo
[5:45:31] taylerjayy: @Towelliee dldnt asmongold say he wanted devs to talk shit
[5:45:35] hrdstylem: i missed what brack said someone tell me
[5:45:36] SpectralExa: JAB salty his salary was cut
[5:45:38] lawles_walrus: @Towelliee colts sign lt eric fisher
[5:45:40] flebbooo: monkaS
[5:45:44] Malnar1123: Lumping Preach in was so dumb. Especially after he just did an interview with Ion
[5:45:46] dalaraz: @LeonardLongNips problem is when you lie to create impressions
[5:45:48] Molvonos: @fennecx25 That's his community.  Period.  If he doesn't nip the problem in the ass, then he's part of the problem.  You legit cannot argue logically otherwwise.
[5:45:51] SonSonVellano: SonSonVellano subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[5:45:59] sooziecuzie: Boy, I really missed what happened. :/
[5:45:59] Zander_TheGamer: It's true though
[5:46:02] Collected1: 51Nocaster : worth keeping in mind it was the original email that mentioned preach
[5:46:05] honeychonker: You have a right to be upset and say whatever you want though. You don't have a moral obligation to not say something just because of how many people are watching
[5:46:08] hawee11: Subbed?
[5:46:19] Collected1: the names JAB listed were the names the original email listed
[5:46:21] rocthenite: the post felt like it was made by a guy who want to watch the world burn
[5:46:22] SonSonVellano: twitch prime
[5:46:31] CardinalTX: reap what you sow boys
[5:46:33] RoyalFrag: Holy cow did I miss something WutFace
[5:46:34] fennecx25: @molvonos yes i can but i won't write paragraphs here because it's useless xd
[5:46:38] lawles_walrus: @Towelliee LT eric fisher will be signed toa  one year deal worth 9.4 mil
[5:46:46] DelcoAF: it's not him. think of it this way. If you actually do that, he just opened up the floodgates for every random to email him... it's not him lol
[5:46:51] Garrujak: Hey, can't expect someone to pull punches when you attack them every day for "the memes and views"
[5:46:57] Bruhnders: google j allen and sort by this week youll see it on mmochamp
[5:46:57] verentnarv: @towelliee streamer luck LUL
[5:47:01] D3m0nHunt3r666: there aren't many drops in lbrs
[5:47:04] Molvonos: @fennecx25 Nah, you cant.  You can say you can, all you want.  But the Streamer, and his/her mods, have full control over what sort of viewers they enable.
[5:47:13] D3m0nHunt3r666: its ubrs that has more use or strat
[5:47:16] Malnar1123: @Collected1 But he equates Preach with Asmongold and they're not similar at all. They both consume parts of the game the other doesnt touch anymore an Preach is actively looking to benefit the game and offer solutions.
[5:47:26] LeonardLongNips: I just don't he would respond and open the door to every complaint coming his way. I just don't see a president of a major business opening those flood gates.
[5:47:39] Boliath: idk what going on but it sounds we have another you think you but you dont situation right now LOL @Towelliee ?
[5:47:45] Collected1: 51Nocaster : perhaps but if the original email felt preach was worth listing then perhaps JAB agreed
[5:48:03] TheMaxxar: TheMaxxar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months! One more month till 4 years! towByah
[5:48:05] KPable: Will he be ready tho?
[5:48:13] soth_klf: Drama?
[5:48:26] Collected1: its possible that JAB didnt really know who the listed people are but listed them because the original email listed them
[5:48:37] Vexxsis: subject is escalated more then it needed to be
[5:48:38] RoyalFrag: @collected1 can you give me a tldr of what is going on lol just got in here?
[5:48:40] Malnar1123: @Collected1 Either way it's just really unprofessional and ridiculous Blizzard has come to petty stuff like this.
[5:48:55] Exodeo_: I wonder what Reddit is like..
[5:48:58] justlnquisitive: LUL
[5:48:58] soth_klf: omg what happened?
[5:49:01] Dcarter: you watch the Venom 2 trailer yet?
[5:49:03] MrGattz: wow

[5:49:06] MrGattz: is that email real?
[5:49:09] justlnquisitive: Firing squad, of course.
[5:49:13] Wildside1177: For satirical purposes. Nothing
[5:49:13] Garrujak: Libel most likely, right?
[5:49:14] Collected1: RoyalFrag : a "leaked email" from JAB critical of content creators whipping up hysteria
[5:49:15] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: thats a thing?

[5:53:32] Aravarth: That's fair and respectul, ty
[5:53:34] MrGattz: the reason its hard to actually know if its fake or not is that you can edit the html of any website to say litterally anything.

[5:54:59] Babygotbacon: @warrenny lolol no
[5:55:01] MrGattz: @warrenny hostile no. drama yes
[5:55:03] CrusaderNero: he thinks the game is bad, fair enough. The natural thing would be to quit playing, but he cant. addicted.
[5:55:19] verentnarv: @pidiap too much Wendy's affected his brain
[5:55:26] daegoh: what i took from it is he doesnt ike dicks in his salad
[5:55:27] RageerPLZ: @PidiaP it was actually 100+ he stated to play TBC classic which is even worse.
[5:55:34] warrenny: @mrgattz Actually fair tbh
[5:55:47] einself111: on the tower
[5:55:49] Garrujak: @CrusaderNero he's not addicted, he just gets paid too much to do anything else. He's raking in the money being toxic
[5:55:57] dalaraz: on the tower upstairs the letter quest @Towelliee
[5:56:01] aleagues: dude on top of tower
[5:56:07] RagingPunk: are u maining a paly in bc @Towelliee ?
[5:56:07] LeonardLongNips: 100% asmon is about drama, but I wouldn't describe it as hostile in anyway lol
[5:56:08] Humurious: He gotta talk to the orc
[5:56:08] CritcobainTV: it's not at the very top i think
[5:56:08] Boliath: so the icy-veins post got delete but i still have it up lol cause i never closed it.... i could probably snip it and post it?

[5:56:13] tommy_kt: gotta go through some dialog then he gives u a letter
[5:56:15] dalaraz: you get a letter after talking to the npc @Towelliee
[5:56:46] Garrujak: @CrusaderNero "enough" is subjective. He's not the type to take a pay cut for no reason.
[5:56:58] D3m0nHunt3r666: gotta call thongus again
[5:57:02] Kinghorn: he is doing scholo

[5:57:38] Shugaze: yep
[5:57:39] Garrujak: @CrusaderNero and yet he doesn't turn off subs/bits/donos
[5:57:41] MrGattz: yeah
[5:57:48] Rudric_Ice: no way a CEO answers to a streamer
[5:57:48] LeonardLongNips: Thats why I think its super unprofessional

[5:57:53] LeonardLongNips: if real

[5:58:53] Mecabeast: if you used a green screen you could do what swifty does lol

[5:58:58] Bernardo994: PEPE on crotch
[5:58:59] KnsWoW: lets get it

[5:59:01] GTmask: ride on it's head. duckCreep
[5:59:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: re7 from the hub , imagine those jump scares LUL
[5:59:02] Zander_TheGamer: And I think that you are assuming that he thinks of all streamers that way. The three he referred to are exactly that way. But not all streamers/content creators are like that.
[5:59:02] MrGattz: i mean..
[5:59:03] Vexxsis: @towelliee  write my name on you

[6:21:37] Rudric_Ice: corruptions were cool but why would you time gate it with the vendor
[6:21:45] BlueBeast33: Right, so it wasn't finished. That was my point.
[6:21:48] SenseiDomo: i mean i just did lmao
[6:21:53] Blvdman: Imagine not having enough time
[6:21:57] ArcaneSyntax: Shamans didn't change until 9.0 LUL
[6:22:02] shadi972: slow like the government'
[6:22:02] Blvdman: and never fixing it
[6:22:03] Shrapnel_1974: Good morning Hammer Heads
[6:22:04] Aromantis: yoo
[6:22:17] BlueBeast33: Therefore it wasn't finished....
[6:22:19] Vexxsis: dead lines.. ect
[6:22:19] jalloppy: @totallypayingattention i think they're back at the office now that california lifted some of their covid measures

[6:22:24] Unciatim: zoomer mentality.. kekw
[6:22:28] SenseiDomo: theyve had 9 months rright to take feedback and make changes?
[6:22:28] magemaster225: isnt it a problem though if all these design ideas are bad at the start, sounds like theres a bunch of yes-men at the planning comittee
[6:22:31] SenseiDomo: thats plenty of time
[6:22:37] BlueBeast33: That's not what the word means Towelliee lol
[6:22:45] Garrujak: I feel like people seem to think that once you develop a game, you just sit on your butt and go "cool, now we get a break." NO, you never stop developing stuff, especially for a "living" game
[6:22:49] dalaraz: its a problem if it happens in every patch,if you have feedback and you release it but you already fixing it they its problematic
[6:23:00] Aquadriel: when was vendor added?
[6:23:01] Kinetikx1315: YA
[6:23:03] crawcook: I understand things take time, what I disagree with is after that time they still add for example a rotation to a corruption vendor, like why?
[6:23:09] Exilox: but blueBeast33 is kinda right if you releas something what you are planning on changing it isnt finishd :x
[6:23:13] magemaster225: 8.1.5 is when they retuned azerite
[6:23:15] flebbooo: 8.2 u had that questline to get your essences and u got like lvl 35 azerite neck from it
[6:23:16] comp1: better than delaying the game
[6:23:20] Deshio: @Towelliee Is correct here. they have to give a timeframe for work to be complete and they cant change that because of some feedback. The only thing I'd like to see in that department is much more communication on those fixes and more iterations maybe on ptr so we can take an active part in its dev time as well
[6:23:22] VladVolynine: @crawcook that's a design issue
[6:23:23] Shongoshi: so they weren't "fixing" the armor but "changing" it ?
[6:23:28] Aquadriel: 8.1 was second big ring
[6:23:29] Burntlettuce: 8.1 they added another row
[6:23:31] Blvdman: Didnt they add azerite vendors in 8.1?
[6:23:32] PvtHudson093: 3 to 4 months after release
[6:23:33] shogon: lol dont get me started on shams.... in tbc i can dual wind fury weapons, in 9.0 its a bug and disabled.....
[6:23:39] magemaster225: extra ring traits
[6:23:44] Burntlettuce: that's it
[6:23:49] Aquadriel: no just htat
[6:23:51] Kindr1d: you could trade it
[6:23:55] Blvdman: Didnt they add vendors and remove azerite from end of dungeon rewards
[6:23:55] crawcook: @VladVolynine That is why I still think Asmon has a point. They have this weird design process to be polite.
[6:23:55] CloudPants8081: atpBigot
[6:24:00] dalaraz: the level increase on rows per ilvl @Towelliee
[6:24:01] soth_klf: I disagree with that a tripple A company like blizz cant implement a change within a certain timeframe
[6:24:02] Mecabeast: 8.1 was 2nd row and heirloom upgrades and allied races I think?
[6:24:03] Kindr1d: at beg of xpack you couldnt trade azerite gear
[6:24:07] xecksi: shaman are secksi.
[6:24:14] Burntlettuce: 8.2 they just gave everyone their bis ones from raids
[6:24:19] s7wede: @Towelliee Don't you think it's a tad bit dishonest to keep a tweet containing a fake screenshot up on twitter thinking it's a win for "your side"
[6:24:23] Blvdman: FeelsGoodMan Ele main
[6:24:25] shogon: WW monk had an ability that was bugged from 8.0-8.3
[6:24:31] Garrujak: The bigger the company, the harder it is to make big changes

[6:26:05] crawcook: I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard was lacking devs too and that could be affecting things, feels like there is a lot of competition for good devs now.

[7:36:49] Shrapnel_1974: Agreed
[7:36:58] XxExiLexX: I hate those long games during regular season.
[7:37:03] mulletrocker11358: only championship games should ever run that long
[7:37:03] Shrapnel_1974: DOuble Hedders are 7 innings
[7:37:12] Masqerader: 18 inning game is how long it takes for a 9 inning yankee/red sox game
[7:37:17] Masqerader: so i mean.
[7:37:27] Shrapnel_1974: Comes with a *
[7:37:34] Masqerader: Yes it counts
[7:37:36] ranceraptor: madbum did

[7:37:38] ranceraptor: vs the braves

[7:37:53] Masqerader: mlb set the parameters
[7:37:56] Shrapnel_1974: Aye
[7:38:14] nightmayor12: there is a minor league that is getting rid of extra innings and doing a homerun derby style overtime. I think that is awesome

[7:38:34] Masqerader: should a pitcher get a loss if the runner place on 2nd base in extra inning be a loss on the pitchers record? that runner would be there otherwise
[7:38:38] Shrapnel_1974: Thats would be cool
[7:38:47] ranceraptor: make sure you keep chasing everything outside the zone
[7:39:03] Masqerader: that mis gone
[7:39:06] Masqerader: oh shit
[7:39:12] Masqerader: i thought that was out
[7:39:18] nocontextlive: mlb memo said the double header did not officially count.  no *, just 7 no hit baseball
[7:39:22] rhodeos_: #scripted
[7:39:23] Shrapnel_1974: Yes runner at 2nd in Extras counts aginst the pitchers ERA
[7:39:36] PokerFaceMoose: you can change settings so it automatically skips baserunning
[7:39:56] yogithebear1993: u have to make the allstar game
[7:40:06] yogithebear1993: that did it for me
[7:40:13] Masqerader: @nocontextlive except it was a full game according to mlb rules and an official game, so regardless of what idiotic reason MLB says, it is a no hitter without the asterisk
[7:40:18] Shrapnel_1974: @nocontextlive Cool

[7:50:35] ranceraptor: I mean you are locked behind Gio Urshela and DJL
[7:50:40] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: who's the starter on the Yankees
[7:50:41] SonofHorus82: I was playing yesterday and fucking pitchers hit me in the ass twice in the same game.
[7:50:47] nightmayor12: You look like you are playing golf with those swings
[7:50:58] Jboogz718: U made a two way that‚Äôs y

[7:51:51] Obast: yeah two way players will take longer to get called up it seems this year
[7:52:40] ranceraptor: my two way player got called up with a 61 pitching and 68 batting (LF) early in my second season. It all depends on MLB team needs.
[7:53:03] Jboogz718: Literally called up to Angels one way pitcher first season in august. Two way slows it down.
[7:53:10] Shrapnel_1974: You are competing with Giovanny Urshela for the starting position at 3rd... thats rough
[7:53:29] WeedIsMySin__: LOL

[7:54:43] cormaccovegaming: bunt/
[7:55:07] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: goldglove doesn't like legend either, he's playing on hall of fame
[7:55:19] Obast: hit a home run or run home your choice said the coach Kappa
[7:55:33] Shrapnel_1974: Just a long strike
[7:55:54] Obast: pulled it just a lil too much dang
