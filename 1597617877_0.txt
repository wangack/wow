[0:44:55] Shingatsu: BUYING A PORSCHE
[0:44:57] CptLadiesMan: Not consistent.
[0:44:58] emaclune: damn bros, you don't block ads? lol
[0:45:01] RealDane: it varies a lot yep
[0:45:03] invalidsimptv: amazon just paid for nfl thursday night rights... gotta find the money somewhere @jakenbakeLIVE

[0:45:07] golaki: thats lunch money for months -.-
[0:45:08] Starwinpikachu: @josgar1017 jnbL
[0:45:09] Arctauran: @GreenyScott yeah same. dont bother checking out new streams for that exact reason. fuck jumping in to get ads straight away
[0:45:15] thesbm: this is why ads are bad, people and companies shouldn't rely on them
[0:45:18] Sedai: pikaboo is smart
[0:45:23] GunsGoBLAKABLAKA: YEP it is kind of a business
[0:45:25] buritzu_tensai: @hothotheals twitch doesn't promote turbo
[0:45:35] clm_big_j: but that's not their only revenue stream? They have ads and sponsorships and merch etc.
[0:45:38] neverust: Amazon paid 13 billion for NFL, guess thats why
[0:45:41] Skindef: we had our out from big corpo ads and everyone welcomed them back NotLikeThis

[0:46:06] obtoe_: the average viwers on twitch doesnt even know Turbo exists
[0:46:07] MrJunezz: cant 5heads find a way to make a ad blocker
[0:46:08] behindthescones: tax optimizing
[0:46:08] misteronetwo518: you could go make $1000 a week at a normal job.
[0:46:08] mmoody23: or switch it. i've been on mobile and some times they do the sidebar-ad. so the toggle screen on desk top, switch it. put the ad on top of the chat and mute the main video and so on
[0:46:10] Zemuda: Greedy twitch
[0:46:12] Juls_AC: I never watch ads anyway KEK
[0:46:13] Sedai: i dont see ads :)
[0:46:14] BadHabitat: I feel like instead of trying to fix twitch everyone should switch to youtube and convince them to change how streamer visibility works on that website, viewership/money would be better for the content creators, being able to skip ads would be better for viewers, and twitch is actively killing itself anyway.
[0:46:14] roller3d: yeah man these days I'm on YT most of the time

[0:46:31] yucklesuccle: turbo users GIGACHAD
[0:46:33] interIude: ad block EZ
[0:46:34] GreenyScott: @obtoe_ they threatened to remove ads from twitch turbo once, when they removed ad free viewing from twitch prime, which caused a lot of people to distrust it
[0:46:34] Wh1teNoise: gang gang
[0:46:37] B0WiEZ: @nutting yes
[0:46:38] Raiwo: Yeah there should be time

[0:46:47] misteronetwo518: i agree on that, the prerolls make me only watch a couple of people
[0:46:51] Jamason__: I would not watch twitch if i didn't have turbo
[0:46:53] Onfight: get a vpn to lithuania guys... i havent seen an ad in years
[0:46:54] emtee53: ads on mobile devices suck even more. everytime i switch between streamers i get ads
[0:46:55] eDexter: why doesn't twitch figure out how to get more people here instead of taking from the creators
[0:46:59] Andles1: pull up that ad manager,you wont Kapp
[0:47:06] DonLeeThe3rd: Yeah the running joke around here is jakenadbreak LULW
[0:47:06] TodoGuts: A few days ago, i think on Joey's stream, i got 6 ads at once. It got stuck on the 6th with 1 second left. I refreshed and got 6 more ads. 12 ads in 5 minutes.
[0:47:08] obtoe_: @interIude i think i heard about that too, insane
[0:47:10] Kuromeyo: m going back in time to delete anyone that made ads
[0:47:11] Lobo_SF: discoverabilty is already hard on this platform, throwing a 1/6 just makes it worse
[0:47:15] Ange1ism: more youtube deals incoming PepeLaugh
[0:47:18] Arctauran: @eDexter cause they know they can fuck over streamers. where else will the streamers go?
[0:47:21] obtoe_: @interIude wrong reply
[0:47:24] JUK1NG: there must be another platform that's about to evolve and twitch knows everyone is going to ask for better contracts
[0:47:26] xMika1: hen we going to yt Jake?
[0:47:28] frostedshaikhs: shameless fr
[0:47:31] AahNiky: just sub to skip ad 4Head
[0:47:31] Hells0_0: @jakenbakeLIVE Have you thought about trying out doing any Youtube streams to test the platform
[0:47:32] shaggytreats: @ryonenx Thats it ivs I got it wrong first time
[0:47:32] eDexter: @Arctauran fax
[0:47:36] thesbm: @jakenbakeLIVE if you think every viewer had twitch turbo, twitch would lose money on ad views ?
[0:47:37] CallMeInfinity: If I get hit with a pre-roll I'm out peepoLeave
[0:47:39] obtoe_: @GreenyScott I think i heard about that too, thats insane

[0:48:33] Reactable: more ads and now a wealth tax
[0:48:34] Cazzorla: Twitch abusing there monopoly position
[0:48:37] neverust: they dont even advertise twitch turbo
[0:48:40] reeezky: remove ads for jake and bake but still give him money for them!
[0:48:47] shaggytreats: @ryonenx They claim in their statement for a retail customer it would cost millions to run a website such as twitch but we both know thats with their 500% mark up on cost
[0:48:47] IronsFanDan: Yeah it’s almost bought up to TV when u watch an nfl game
[0:48:48] Arctauran: @Talk2Timbo time to use your influence at your work, so they can buy Twitch, and make it better

[0:49:58] xMika1: Corpo shills /Spit
[0:50:03] GreenyScott: it kinda blows my mind they decided to release that blog post at 3 am
[0:50:03] IronsFanDan: You have to remember they are pumping ads out to force people to start paying for twitch turbo.
[0:50:08] noc7t: IRL streaming is basically spending your earnings on stream for content
[0:50:08] HotHotHeals: We need content creators to create their own ads to play
[0:50:15] HotHotHeals: or have some type of interactive ads
[0:50:28] amv1: So i guess its better to donate say $3 to steamer per month rather than subbing for $5
[0:50:29] mmoody23: NODDERS

[0:50:50] obtoe_: @IronsFanDan its actually the opposite, they dont want people to know about turbo
[0:50:54] Ange1ism: making creators say plz watch ads is ganna be so funny to hear
[0:50:58] RocOn: @Talk2Timbo   my Bro t2tL
[0:50:59] BillHwang: amazon servers are basically free for twitch
[0:51:01] ramp7: how much is turbo?
[0:51:03] CallMeInfinity: mf complaining about price and infra when youre parent company literally owns AWS
[0:51:07] fartpies: Sounds like an amazon company, thats the new future with all the monopolies now and in the future
[0:51:12] misteronetwo518: you could also say twitch prime was you investment in the future, it want going to last forever. theres is a push pull.
[0:51:12] IronsFanDan: @jamason__ yeah I suppose
[0:51:13] Arctauran: i know it would suck massively for the streamers, but maybe the Twitch Apocalypse needs to happen @jakenbakeLIVE, so they stop screwing over everyone
[0:51:15] MainlyHigh: im sorry doesnt it stay 70/30 until you hit 100k in subs ?
[0:51:17] HotHotHeals: I think turbo is what $15 a month now?
[0:51:25] golaki: its a corp now

[1:40:37] CallMeInfinity: No cap this game is pretty fun. It stays true to the Star Trek story as you get to command your own fleet just as Kirk did. There's a huge world with many galaxies to discover and pirates to fend off. Allies to make or enemies to defeat. I'd say it's a top 3 mobile MMO, SeemsGood Would recommend.

[2:43:50] CallMeInfinity: No cap this game is pretty fun. It stays true to the Star Trek story as you get to command your own fleet just as Kirk did. There's a huge world with many galaxies to discover and pirates to fend off. Allies to make or enemies to defeat. I'd say it's a top 3 mobile MMO, SeemsGood Would recommend.
