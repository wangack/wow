[1:09:41] OgreCasual: Is there any discussion for changes to PVP gearing systems? Currently, it feels like you have to do a ton of PVE to open the door to PVP success. I like the catch-up mechanics but it seems that by the time you're geared enough to win arenas, the conquest rewards aren't as useful as they would be if you didn't already spend a bunch of time doing mythics/raiding.
