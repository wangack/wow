[7:08:45] freeagent80505: You don't play dead with grizzlies
[7:08:51] Thomsan04: 1 human with weapons could kill a gorilla or a bear
[7:08:52] GrandmasCloset: The goirilla will literally just crush its fucking skull
[7:08:52] Cosmic_Waves: Lmao
[7:08:52] 81unt: socket is dumbs lmao
[7:08:54] Trae618: The claws would matter
[7:08:56] BaddestCloud: what the fuck is this stoner argument?
[7:08:58] A_RCHR: humans can kill anything with weapons
[7:08:59] 81unt: bri what
[7:09:04] SeusV: grizzlys are so strong and have so much natural armor that they shrug off shotgun shots...
[7:09:09] Qrucials: @Graycen you're 100% right, the weight is too big a difference and the bear would fuck it up
[7:09:12] Thomsan04: speed doesnt matter  in a cage
[7:09:14] BaddestCloud: “a gorilla has the strength of 5 humans man trust”
[7:09:14] 81unt: yeah a human and a gun can legit kill anything
[7:09:15] ari_sap: i bet a grizzly is faster ngl

[7:09:34] Thomsan04: bears can climb trees
[7:09:36] BaddestCloud: the more you add the more impossible the argument is
[7:09:37] Trae618: The grizzly having claws is the difference
[7:09:43] SeusV: pffft
[7:10:02] SeusV: grizzly are faster, stronger, more endurance in every wau
[7:10:04] sighwarlock: xdd
[7:10:04] cbell829: silverback just sticks a thumb in the bears ass and its gg
[7:10:05] BaddestCloud: gorillas at known for their infinite wisdom

[7:10:12] Thomsan04: bears can climb trees in like 5 seconds
[7:10:12] BaddestCloud: +5 wis
[7:10:13] Parcelazo: he's confusing black bears with grizzly bears, grizzly bears are the epitome of a killing machine after polar bears
[7:10:15] A_RCHR: this mf is not real
[7:10:22] DuckSmoke_: Grizzlys can take a beating, the Silverback has no chance.
[7:10:30] sighwarlock: polar bears merk
[7:10:36] SeusV: grizzlys can literally take gun shots like its nothing
[7:10:37] i_hatehavingtosignup: bear would win have you seen them fight eachother
[7:10:37] Thomsan04: why does the gorilla get to go for the face but the bear  cant?
[7:10:53] BerkTheLUL: bro they think gorrillas can just dodge everything. they wont dodge shit
[7:11:04] ari_sap: the bear goes for the neck fr
[7:11:04] Qrucials: bring back the colosseum
[7:11:08] cbusbb: if they are close in size the gorilla gonna win
[7:11:09] Trae618: The gorilla would try to grapple and it would get slashed open by the claws
[7:11:22] certtifiedg: giga song
[7:11:26] BaddestCloud: @graycen https://youtu.be/insxmHlhfDw?si=yR69iMQhMmoRN_M4
[7:11:30] Parcelazo: a bear is the size of a small car, and can run like one, a gorilla could never
[7:11:37] Thomsan04: bear can maul the skin off the gorilla's face
[7:11:39] cbell829: Silverback Gorilla off the top rope
[7:11:41] geffres: I cant wait for phase 2 of sod im so over rp om
[7:11:47] DuckSmoke_: The Grizzly would just rip the Gorillas arm off if it went to grab it's face.
[7:11:51] ari_sap: one slash or bite to the neck kills the gorilla too
[7:11:52] rohdey: theres a game where you can sim this out, 100 bears vs 100 gorillas
[7:11:53] silan: @cbell829 KEKG
[7:12:05] Trae618: I'm so confused on how he doesn't think the claws don't matter lol
[7:12:08] i_hatehavingtosignup: one slash and the gorilla be fucked they don’t have the thick ass skin lil a bear has
[7:12:13] SeusV: most don't know what they are talking about. grizzlys and cats have skin that "moves around" giving it waaaay more durability and cut resistance
[7:12:24] eygton: google says a grizzly would win you take this W
[7:12:34] Thomsan04: guys who wins a silverback gorilla with the IQ of a pro MMA fighter or a bear  that is just gonna sit there?
[7:12:39] Parcelazo: one slash and the gorilla would be begging for tarzan to come in and save the day
[7:12:39] sleeplesswolf94: @Trae618 cause the agility of silverback, would most likely back away in time
[7:13:07] Trae618: Bro a swipe to the face of a gorilla would fuck it
[7:13:14] cbell829: what if the silverback knows juijitsu
[7:13:18] Sazaruna: claws matter if it was human to bear, because we have less mass to tear through, but a gorilla has a lot more mass, they wont just go down
[7:13:19] ari_sap: yeah
[7:13:20] Thomsan04: yes
[7:13:22] Higgs22: yes
[7:13:22] Trae618: Yes
[7:13:23] drewj_el: gorilla wins hands down
[7:13:28] sighwarlock: yeah
[7:13:30] rohdey: i think either has potential to one shot
[7:13:32] Thomsan04: bear can blitz a gorilla  1v1
[7:13:32] DuckSmoke_: Bear wins, idgaf what anyone else says.
[7:13:33] Trae618: They have huge ass fucking claws
[7:13:37] crowgoes: grizzly too big fora gorilla
[7:13:37] rigoristorphan: there claws are like 4in long that woulsd destroy a gorilla
[7:13:37] ErobbIsWhite: you are such a grizzly fanboy FeelsWeirdMan
[7:13:38] SeusV: the bear could break the silverback's back in 1 swipe... they do that shit to moose which are waaay bigger than a silverback
[7:13:38] Higgs22: the bear has way more power
[7:13:48] drewj_el: put it to a vote!
[7:13:48] sighwarlock: now if the gorilla has a glock
[7:13:51] A_RCHR: grizzly are smash any ape in like 2 minutes
[7:13:55] Nightbot: Follow my twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/graycen
[7:13:56] Parcelazo: @Thomsan04 the gorilla only if its the size or a little bigger than the bear, because you cannot strangle a bear, that neck is massive
[7:13:59] Fakomi: A zoo should do this scenario so this argument if over once and for all. I'm sure even peta would want to watch it.
[7:14:01] ari_sap: those claws aint made for scratching. those things are slashing that bear
[7:14:05] ari_sap: gorilla*
[7:14:25] Trae618: Take away the bears claws and it's a different fight
[7:14:37] Nightbot: My second channel is twitch.tv/definitelygraycen

[7:15:25] rohdey: a cobra
[7:15:27] Trae618: No wrong
[7:15:31] cbusbb: if the bear is in the jungle on the gorillaz turf its getting fucked up imo, 1 is a predator and 1 is more territorial fighting
[7:15:32] Fakomi: a mongoos Sussy
[7:15:34] rohdey: mongooses are snake hunters

[7:17:06] DuckSmoke_: Comparing weight of a mongoose and a snake Dentge
[7:17:10] Fakomi: Graycen mofuka
[7:17:14] manati889: Minus 2 RP for googling offstream

[9:26:13] Poisonslash: @yomawma_banevading Isn't that like.... just a regular robbing? KEKW
[9:26:17] fyisic: lootbox is treating people like an npc and not RP
[9:26:21] thorzain_22: The moral of the story is eat ass smoke grass
[9:26:22] fyisic: that didnt happen
[9:26:22] Fakomi: A lot of ppl think you guys camp houses because that time xqc caught you "stalking" his house. When you were just randomly having a meeting there. RP viewers dont care about context
[9:26:24] djanik31: I watched their POV after, they were all crying lmao. But also they mentioned how they bought stuff for cheap that was stolen from someone's apartment so it's really hypocritical
[9:26:33] Leysfort: fucking guppers
[9:26:41] Usahi_Light: idk how people thought the hous was camped it was 100% coincidence OMEGALUL
[9:26:50] Broosh: i love Lenny and i've watched GTA RP for a while.  If they DIDNT want someone to clear an entire house with the keys, then they need to make that a rule.  Lenny shouldn't've have been an example of the consequence, he should've been an example of the rule.  You are given a key to a house, you should be looting it.
[9:27:07] Broosh: It shouldn't be decided by the Rpers what all they take
[9:27:16] Leysfort: did Esfand ever find his other earbud?
[9:27:17] moa285: essaying
[9:27:17] ari_sap: they just got such a hate boner for lenny
[9:27:25] relmo: graycen is use to playing wow. you get loot from raids and viewers in wow. so he's just getting use to RP or earning stuff on his own
[9:27:30] purplepoodle89: @fyisic as a crim... wouldn't a mark be a mark? i have no empathy for someone slackin'
[9:27:40] Naboo69: @Broosh after the rule was established too they ended up giving all their shit back. having clear rules would've avoided a lot of drama
[9:27:41] thorzain_22: I think the admins were sick of Lenny farting
[9:27:45] Brlskull: wow a crowbar how generous
[9:27:49] camyo: pokiLoser deserved
[9:27:56] ErobbIsWhite: clipped you admitting it FeelsOkayMan
[9:27:56] SwitchBord001: @Leysfort HA! I saw that stream too LOL. I don't believe he ever found it.
[9:27:56] anarkeagz: i dont understand why they would let you equip a lootable key if you arent allowed to use it lol
[9:28:09] ari_sap: we all know you're not permabanned because you snitched on lenny and steven
[9:28:18] jaliela01: i was dying laughing when you guys were coming up with riddles for them. "whoopdy diddly doo, we stole your stuff from you" lmao
[9:28:21] Poisonslash: Imagine getting robbed irl and the dude is like, "you know what I'm in a good mood today, I'l only take your phone" KEKW
[9:28:23] bamboniiii: That's why rp community is actual trash. Lmao its fucking gta. Bunch pussies reporting people
[9:29:11] thorzain_22: Fuck the lumber union anyway destroying trees and not planting new ones to replace them
[9:29:13] GrandmasCloset: rp nerds were the the douche bag clique theater kids in high school
[9:29:30] GrandmasCloset: EEEEEEEEEEE
[9:29:31] Lagbolta: Imagine getting upset over a game, its incredibly pathetic
[9:29:31] Freddiepines: mcretEee
[9:29:36] moa285: AnnyLebronJam E E E E
[9:29:46] dduxxx: @GrandmasCloset You  went to a very different school than me
[9:29:47] Broosh: @Naboo69 Bingo.  There should be a lot of discretion for RP, but if you're gonna perma someone for using a mechanic: you need to make specific rules about that mechanic.
[9:29:50] camyo: u dont even know
[9:29:51] relmo: the loot wasn't really an issue. the bigger problem was graycen not letting them talk or have any RP at all
[9:29:51] camyo: stop talking shit
[9:29:52] ari_sap: quick fall guys win?
