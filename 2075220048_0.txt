[0:31:41] tvilk: KEKL
[0:32:02] CyonDru: i do think the avg league player is more ill than the avg wow player
[0:32:30] tvilk: That's just cus more people play wow casually than league casually
[0:33:08] CyonDru: i just remember i was doing low level unranked games and i apparently bought the wrong item, then i got called slurs and told to be reported
[0:33:09] CyonDru: KEKW
[0:33:09] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:33:18] CyonDru: cause i was "inting"
[0:33:44] itsmagyks: Has anyone ever considered that JB's chest hair could be an alien organism that attached itself to him and now controls his brain without him realizing it?
[0:34:32] CyonDru: @jdotb this game has consumed my guild
[0:34:34] tvilk: @CyonDru I was level 4 on a fresh account, cus I have no idea how to play the game, and got omega flamed for being a bad support because I didn't engage and he even reported me
[0:34:36] zani_eu: His Chesthair looks like Growls Cat
[0:34:48] CyonDru: @tvilk lmfao
[0:35:16] tvilk: like bro im level 4 and have 2 games with Lux ofc I won't know wtf im doing
[0:35:23] CyonDru: yeah it is wild
[0:35:41] CyonDru: I have actually never seen anything close to that level of toxicity anywhere else
[0:35:45] tvilk: he asked me if I was retarded and I said "I've literally never played this game before" and he said "keep it that way"
[0:35:45] CyonDru: and there are some toxic areas
[0:36:10] tvilk: don't worry I'm notorious for finding toxic people in online games classic
[0:36:48] carterblueman: @jdotb  do you run Heart of the Wild for purely damage or because you can't run nature's vigil (due to 10% bear hp talent)
[0:37:58] tvilk: @carterblueman It's only like Fall you would need innervate, so if you wan't NV you're wasting 2 points. HOTW is purely for DPS but I guess you can use it defensively for bear form too
[0:38:10] tvilk: want*
[0:38:23] CyonDru: @carterblueman hotw is for damage yes
[0:38:28] Toffur: holy
[0:38:47] carterblueman: What I meant to ask is is it better damage than nature's vigil* or is he forced to run it for the 10% bear hp talent
[0:38:53] CyonDru: man lost my boy zero to outlaw, a shame
[0:38:56] CyonDru: where is the assa dream
[0:39:39] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:40:25] tvilk: overall hotw is definitely a better dps talent. You get it for 1 point, whereas you need to spend 2 points to get NV, potentially 3 if you aren't already picking Vortex/Mass root
[0:40:38] carterblueman: gotcha thx!
[0:40:44] tvilk: not only that, NV doesn't do as much DPS as it used to
[0:41:14] tvilk: the reason you pick it in raid content is because you're unlikely to get benefit from HOTW due to not picking cat talents
[0:41:17] erectiliann: Season 4 April?
[0:41:24] tvilk: and its right under innervate which you are already taking in raid
[0:41:32] carterblueman: i main feral so i will always pick cat talents
[0:41:53] tvilk: hopefully not as resto in raid
[0:42:00] Toffur: Catweaving is so fucking nice dude holy quac
[0:42:25] tvilk: catweaving is great but you're not really catweaving in raid content unless you're doing normal or heroic maybe
[0:42:53] carterblueman: i would never play resto in raid lol
[0:43:09] tvilk: wait so are you asking about hotw in terms of feral or resto?
[0:43:30] carterblueman: resto, i'm offspecing resto for dungeons
[0:43:40] carterblueman: but the WoWhead m+ build takes NV
[0:43:43] carterblueman: so i was confused
[0:43:43] tvilk: ah okay, yes then what i said applies KEKW
[0:43:57] tvilk: Wowhead guides usually go for what's easy to play with
[0:44:01] WytherOK: don't read the wowhead guides, just check the higher raider.io m+ players builds
[0:44:20] WytherOK: or find a streamer on raider.io and ask them in their chat
[0:44:22] tvilk: The point of the wowhead guide is to teach you how to play the class, not to go into the advance stuff
[0:44:24] WytherOK: best way to get actual info
[0:44:31] carterblueman: @WytherOK that's what i did xD
[0:44:41] WytherOK: jdotbBrain
[0:44:50] tvilk: I assume the wowhead guide also doesn't say to pick skull bash?
[0:44:58] tvilk: Skull Bash is omega bis for pug m+
[0:45:06] WytherOK: I mean I aint gonna fault a resto druid for not taking skull bash
[0:45:11] CyonDru: @carterblueman you can take both NV and hotw for absolute min max damage, but in higher keys you generally wont take nv
[0:45:20] carterblueman: meld rake is the new skull bash
[0:45:21] WytherOK: "Oh I should interrupt" *leaps to death*
[0:45:33] tvilk: @WytherOK me neither, but I'm picking skull bash 100% of the time when pugging
[0:45:39] WytherOK: fair
[0:45:39] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[0:46:23] tvilk: Not picking skull bash means trusting your pugs to interrupt.... and um.. yeah
[0:46:25] tvilk: KEKL
[0:46:39] carterblueman: oh skull bash..i was thinking of maul lmao
[0:46:53] carterblueman: i just call it kick
[0:47:27] WytherOK: why is zero healing the boss?
[0:47:27] godenstag: @carterblueman basically everyone calls interrupts KICKS
[0:47:29] WytherOK: is rogue just down bad?
[0:48:03] YumYumSaucin: 3 damage meters cause healing doesn't matter these days? lol
[0:48:11] tvilk: @carterblueman This is what I run with usually in keys, leaving 4 points to be spent on whatever is left. 5 if you don't need Imp Nature's Cure https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/restoration/DAQQUEUVSIAiFQEAwBBAAA
[0:48:30] carterblueman: thanks!
[0:49:21] tvilk: if your group doesn't need you to kick, you have more leeway to go Thick Hide for defensive and Matted Fur into Incap roar. But I would only do that if I was running with premade
[0:51:07] erectiliann: Guys, April 9th is a conservative guess for season 4.
[0:51:17] erectiliann: Won’t be long now!
[0:51:27] WytherOK: I wonder if we get fated raids again 4Head
[0:51:37] erectiliann: I bet we do

[0:52:09] Lum3x: zero :)))
[0:53:35] tvilk: surely this is not a mix? That transition was so bad
[0:57:03] dellmanz: Which healers do you think will be top m+ healers in season 4?
[0:57:32] tvilk: That's so hard to say. Depends a lot of which tier sets will be chosen and how the tuning will be
[0:57:51] dellmanz: Tier sets has been voted on?
[0:58:25] tvilk: Yeah but how do we know they will pick the most voted? What if 2 tiers have 60/40? Blizzard can choose to pick the 40 pick because whatever reason they please
[0:58:39] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[0:58:41] dellmanz: True
[0:59:01] tvilk: and they said they would change the numbers to make it competitive choices, but cmon it's blizzard..
[0:59:28] tvilk: And we also don't know which dungeons yet which will factor in meta
[0:59:57] dellmanz: Yeah.. Monk are probably going to get sent back again.. They are only allowed to be "okay" for one season every other expansion haha
[1:00:08] tvilk: kek
[1:00:14] kuro1516: evoker heal will be meta xd
[1:00:26] tvilk: idk when ptr comes up, but until then we have no idea which classes might even be good
[1:00:40] dellmanz: Openly hoping for Shaman to be at the top
[1:00:50] dellmanz: But tier sets have been kinda meh

[1:01:42] weedyy22: pretty sure u could play every healer really close to 3.9k this season
[1:01:53] joxiusby: jdotbGasm_SG
[1:02:11] dellmanz: Holy priest.. I rest my case
[1:03:25] tvilk: @dellmanz https://raider.io/mythic-plus-runs/season-df-3/24327151-31-ataldazar You were saying? KEKW
[1:04:28] tvilk: @weedyy22 highest pres evoker rn is 3689 Aware
[1:04:31] throwmasterlol: your movement is so clean though. very cool to watch
[1:04:37] FrostmagicED: you could play holy priest to 3900; Nax literally was CRUSHING early season
[1:05:07] throwmasterlol: in perfect position for the big aoe and all that even when the rogue had the debuff
[1:05:19] weedyy22: @tvilk pretty sure a R1 multclass healer could push a pres evoker easily to 3.8k+
[1:05:29] dellmanz: @tvilk I will eat my words

[1:05:58] AlsoZen: I've tried most healers (except paladin), pres really struggles sometimes. PS: agreed about the groups
[1:05:59] joxiusby: shamans are the most useless healing class in mythics +
[1:06:03] FrostmagicED: https://raider.io/characters/us/tichondrius/Nax check them tapes (40 pts away)
[1:06:08] throwmasterlol: is disc a lot better?
[1:06:10] Adrang: ayije could do it after getting disc to 3980
[1:06:27] AlsoZen: Safety first
[1:06:43] joxiusby: best healers are the ones who have absorbs and/or passive self healing
[1:06:45] joxiusby: shamans have none of that
[1:06:57] tvilk: Top AD runs are no healer comps Aware https://raider.io/mythic-plus-rankings/season-df-3/all/world/leaderboards-strict
[1:07:01] Fraantic: that is extremely untrue lmao
[1:07:07] weedyy22: @joxiusby they give 10% more hp buff.. or did they remove that?
[1:07:09] AlsoZen: Agreed with Fraantic
[1:07:16] joxiusby: 10% more hp at the cost of what
[1:07:26] joxiusby: thats x2 points talents that can be used for ascedance
[1:07:26] tvilk: @weedyy22 So priest buff? KEKW
[1:07:41] FrostmagicED: he did a huge push that week and then he stopped
[1:07:47] darkol33t: i got 3.1k rio on my hpriest
[1:07:49] weedyy22: @tvilk nope its bigger HP buff
[1:07:49] FrostmagicED: b/c people STILL didn't invite him LOL
[1:08:00] tvilk: what you looking at jb? The Nax priest guy?
[1:08:02] darkol33t: now trying resto druid or hpala
[1:08:16] AlsoZen: Isn't that correct?
[1:08:21] AlsoZen: Or logical
[1:08:25] Fraantic: Nax is a chick
[1:08:26] Fraantic: not a guy
[1:08:32] FrostmagicED: I mean he just wants to be top he's in the title band either away also grats on ur mf mount
[1:08:35] FrostmagicED: Applecatgun
[1:08:40] Shirey12: Y'all think the 8 new hero talents will be them finishing up Druid,Mage,Priest,DK,Warr, and Paladin. I hope we see new class hero talents we haven't seen today
[1:09:08] tvilk: I don't think they will show new oracle talents yet at least
[1:09:18] tvilk: but im also not too fuzzed about hero talents
[1:09:42] Shirey12: @tvilk I'd rather it be theme and new animations making classes unique. Like mistweaver
[1:09:49] weedyy22: this meta talks comes often from narrowminded ppl who dont understand the game and just watch ladders
[1:09:50] AlsoZen: I will much rather play Shaman than Pres or Holy Pala tbh
[1:10:05] Adrang: thats kind of what i meant before too. ayije only runs holy on keys that he has an easier time on disc already
[1:10:09] joxiusby: shaman takes more skill than pala or priest
[1:10:17] joxiusby: too many buttoms ,useless bottoms
[1:10:22] joxiusby: that we are forced to use
[1:10:27] ren0m: This ongoing about what's meta and what's not makes me not want to play my "off-meta" alts. But I comfort myself that strict meta only applies for 30-ish keys.
[1:10:32] AlsoZen: Disc, Druid and Monk being the obvious go-to's
[1:10:52] Shirey12: I just want my Affliction rework. uncap UA, take malefic rapture out and it will reduce button bloat.
[1:10:56] weedyy22: @joxiusby and then there is ppl saying shaman is easy as fk cause u got low haste and therefore slower playstyle
[1:10:56] joxiusby: shamans totems should not be part of a GCD , that would make them a bit better in keys
[1:11:01] tvilk: @ren0m only applies to- sure, but still not getting invited to +10s on my 3200 aff warlock KEKW
[1:11:09] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb

[1:11:53] weedyy22: @tvilk stop it xD this may be a onetimer
[1:11:59] tvilk: @weedyy22 KEKW

[1:16:48] turfjitsu: i woiuld have made the coffee lmao
[1:16:54] weedyy22: @tvilk i can decline you in some +5s if u want so u can do a reddit post about it? just hit me up
[1:17:02] caradea_: just offer them some aswell, "since you guys are already awake"
[1:17:09] tvilk: @weedyy22 fuck yes, love me some free karma

[1:18:19] caradea_: wild charge?
[1:19:35] goilen: I got jdotbaited by new hero talents title
[1:20:06] slackstacker: is someones been playing non stop 10-14 hours a day since patch release shouldn't they be atleast 3600 by now? only playing one toon
[1:20:41] caradea_: how much of that is vadrakken afk time though
[1:21:20] slackstacker: not a lot
[1:21:43] slackstacker: they always looking for keys doesnt raid either
[1:22:53] caradea_: well if they're decent players and play a spec that people want to invite, yeah
[1:24:08] slackstacker: the persons just super toxic toward everyone but isnt even 3500. so i was just trying to see if thats even for amount of time he plays
[1:24:25] slackstacker: even good for amount of time he plays*
[1:25:18] weedyy22: he admit to play 10-14hours a day till patch release? thats crazy hours for 3.5k u push 2 weeks
[1:25:39] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[1:26:15] caradea_: well, if they're that toxic they break keys/groups because of their attitude, if you're not able to push higher with that amount of time it's on them
[1:26:27] weedyy22: @slackstacker my friend started pugging 3 weeks ago... geared beforehand and is now 3650ish only pugging
[1:26:35] caradea_: because it's the only consistent factor across all groups they're in
[1:27:39] weedyy22: imo if u strong defensively and have high awareness 3.5k is easy to push past

[3:53:44] xGuiha: I think thats okay
[3:53:50] Milano___: More passive effects, likely to reduce number of keys needed to press
[3:54:29] Twizited: Those look backwards
[3:54:31] leubinator: i think those are swapped
[3:54:33] ren0m: Divine storm on holy?
[3:54:49] Twizited: True
[3:54:49] branphd: so do dh only get one choice since they only have 2 specs?
[3:54:57] Phasedr: well considering ret literally doesnt have lod

[3:56:22] ren0m: So the whole talent tree is- add dmg, duration, speed, etc to sunspot
[3:56:24] sawako07: why not make it 100% increased ms, would be fun af
[3:56:40] AlsoZen: Sun out of his ass

[3:58:59] supzfly: make light of dawn a dmg cone :D
[3:59:01] Livid_Lycan: Hpal is becoming a Hot spec
[3:59:18] Milano___: When you see mistakes like that, it really gives off the impression only one person made this and posted it
[3:59:53] Tassakos: they removed it with rework
[4:00:00] Lewsea: Stronger batteries?
[4:00:14] Twizited: No they didnt
[4:00:16] Tassakos: second sunrise i mean, now you only have the range talent
[4:00:18] Twizited: Its called Breaking Dawn
[4:00:21] supzfly: it's called breaking down
[4:00:23] Twizited: The range is still there
[4:00:24] PNZTK: @Milano___ when you write things it really gives off the impression that you have negative brain cells
[4:00:25] supzfly: *dawn
[4:00:41] weedyy22: @supzfly what we do with shield of the righteos then?
[4:00:50] Livid_Lycan: LOL

[4:01:11] supzfly: @weedyy22 good question... never said it made sense
[4:01:12] leubinator: damn hit him with the buddy
[4:01:19] leubinator: its joever
[4:01:34] weedyy22: xD
[4:01:38] Livid_Lycan: you get a laser beam to your sunspot
[4:01:44] AlsoZen: literally happened to a colleague a week ago

[4:02:12] Lewsea: be me: dead in a key. Healer: you shoulda run through my disco beams bitch
[4:02:13] Livid_Lycan: the ret prot tree makes hammers fall from the fucking sky like crazy
[4:02:16] AlsoZen: 5 targets.
[4:02:35] supzfly: sounds like a clusterfuck for spotting mechanics
[4:02:51] ren0m: I need to see 5 paladin groups with that
[4:03:16] caradea_: why dont druids get laser beams
[4:03:17] Lewsea: Oracle KEKW
[4:03:20] caradea_: fk those flower petals
[4:03:28] Lewsea: @caradea_ FlOwErZ
[4:03:40] supzfly: this sounds like diablo
[4:03:47] Redivna: Pop wrath, mount up and blind everyone lol
[4:03:47] GrumpyKale: Herald of the Vines
[4:03:54] treavorthenusance: why do pally's have hots
[4:03:56] leubinator: whenever there is big dam in melee and u use wings u gonna shoot up the healmeter
[4:04:08] treavorthenusance: pallys are supposed to have big thicc heals
[4:04:15] Lewsea: Hot druid ability idea - you apply moon and sun light to allies, then you can commune with the moons and all those targets start rapidly shitting flowers everywhere @jdotb
[4:04:24] AstralKiwi0292: solar? aurora? sure this isnt druiid tree?
[4:04:35] treavorthenusance: this tree feels more like druid than paladin to me
[4:04:48] Redivna: I feel like the druid trees lake flavor\inspiration
[4:05:10] Livid_Lycan: fleks with a solid tweet

[4:05:41] ren0m: If Sun is a moonkin thing, what do Paladins get?
[4:06:06] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Just scrap it 4Head
[4:06:25] ren0m: Ye, just add another island and extend DF for one more year
[4:06:34] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They have to add some sort of player power. I don't think people would want nothing added to their class.
[4:06:34] PNZTK: i don't get this take like are we supposed to just play the same classes with 0 changes forever?
[4:06:42] Guffels: they already dont have anything this expac. hero talents are 4 choice nodes per spec and some passives.
[4:06:54] Livid_Lycan: surely theres some void inspiried shit that they could do instead of hero talents
[4:07:11] leubinator: templar is kinda sick colossus makes me want to delete my warrior
[4:07:34] weedyy22: i hope they make changes in M+ , if all stays the same not sure if i wanna play another season
[4:08:11] treavorthenusance: wow this tree is just run a sim and pick the best talent tree LOL
[4:08:11] nikator1: literally the entire wildstalker tree could be replaced with "hot/bleed healing increased by 20%" KEKW
[4:08:14] TBouse: healer movement about to reach all time highs
[4:08:28] Lewsea: I think that's good, no?
[4:08:29] leubinator: i kinda like that most of the trees just enhance playstyles instead of changing them makes it easier to swap with tuning
[4:08:39] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:09:20] Livid_Lycan: theyre making feint a maintenence buff
[4:09:26] TBouse: what if you can extend it for mastery stacks with VI
[4:09:34] treavorthenusance: that tree could be baked in and you'd have no idea
[4:09:43] WytherOK: glizzy fur gonna be the goat
[4:09:43] caradea_: its kinda "things you do anyway proc buffs that benefit the things you do anyway"
[4:09:47] WytherOK: 🐐
[4:10:05] caradea_: would be nice to couple it with an active ability
[4:10:07] Lewsea: Glizzy furrrr daddy yes

[4:11:17] Lewsea: It is difficult to make trees for the main characters in the game
[4:11:20] AlsoZen: Few years ago, I would've said warrior
[4:11:26] leubinator: arcan/fire arcane/frost sounds cursed to make

[4:13:49] Lewsea: They got you with that curse of tongues @jdotb
[4:13:58] Tortys: Bear / moonkin tree they at least attempted to make an overlap
[4:13:59] AlsoZen: Infernal Machine sounds dope
[4:14:00] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Anals Below YEP
[4:14:34] Lewsea: Infernal Machine looks good for some barrens anal spam

[4:16:59] minischoles: Templar is Watch
[4:17:24] nikator1: sacrosanct is like a more elaborate "sacred"
[4:17:36] caradea_: it means "untouchable" or "unalterable"
[4:17:55] Twizited: enemies?

[4:26:12] ProjectSevan: i hope you like snapping
[4:26:12] Mythos24: or maybe you can have it on the tank for the duration of the dungeon
[4:26:22] reippailija: LMFAO
[4:26:38] MrGharr: they could give a max range to it tho
[4:26:40] alpocopatroleros: That's just rogue stuff
[4:26:44] treavorthenusance: You could do both wings of tott with that talent at the same time
[4:26:45] sw0ngs: snap the whole fucking dungeon to the tank
[4:27:05] Lewsea: Do rogues still have throw dagger?
[4:27:07] Tortys: Can't wait for tanks in the raid to overaggro because of the rogue
[4:27:07] FieryPanda: thats a fun talent for MDI haha
[4:27:11] leubinator: just give it a max range and call it a day

[4:29:39] trivotix: only 50?
[4:29:42] leubinator: using a defensive rotational sounds kinda cursed
[4:29:43] shunsha: attacking from stealth increases dmg by 150% and stealth is permanent
[4:29:51] Lewsea: Well - they nerfed frost having defensives that buff output within 2 weeks. This'll be the same I'm sure
[4:29:55] ren0m: Shifting to Bear increases arcane damage for 5% for 10s
[4:29:57] Probab1e: LOL That cloak change would get so many rogues killed if they had to choose to use it for damageor survival , they'd choose damage every time.
[4:30:02] nikator1: @shunsha thats kinda how outlaw plays on live
[4:30:15] treavorthenusance: 1 hour dmg buff

[4:32:57] Lewsea: sin is 100% the red headed step child of the rogues lol
[4:33:18] Guffels: the audacity to put that tricks node in hero talents and not the class tree shows how piece-meal they are doing this entire dev process
[4:33:34] caradea_: depends how hard the paladin spaceship is gonna hit with the lasers

[4:37:58] clickermekk: jpc tweeted that rogue tree is bad
[4:37:58] Lewsea: @zerossussy He means power wise
[4:38:00] Yzuthoth: having to use a defensive for offensive gain :( :( :(
[4:38:03] reippailija: sure its mean to say 1 minutei nstead of 1 hour
[4:38:09] zerossussy: its dogshit powerwise @Lewsea
[4:38:20] zerossussy: killingspree is useless and mastery is horrible
[4:38:24] dizorid: jpc wasnt thrilled

[4:38:52] ren0m: Has there ever been a big change announced for WoW that people liked?
[4:38:56] zerossussy: they are buffing the talents that aren't being used
[4:38:58] Guffels: they got way more utility than both resto trees
[4:39:09] zerossussy: and they are forcing us to use a defensive for dps

[4:45:49] Klakii: So what would be different if they just put these talents into the class talent tree instead, i dont get what the point of these are as a "feature"
[4:46:13] Guffels: 1. something to put on the back of the box,
[4:46:36] Guffels: 2. not having to find a place in the tree or balance them for being at the bottom. floating nodes are just easier to dev

[5:28:19] reippailija: *seems
[5:28:51] burne114: It's just pure passive pretty much, which is probably boring unless it's super strong
[5:29:30] reippailija: i find it funny that they remove the cap on crests, BUT NOT ON THE FLIGHTSTONES
[5:31:20] Guffels: the cap on crests doesnt matter. no way you could have hit the old cap and not been maxed on 486 crafted right?
