[0:37:07] TheRealJinjix: That's Big Business for you. You're useful until you're not, then just canned.
[0:37:10] alpaca_god_7000: brr i'm a cat
[0:37:10] Methuzahla: @ravenratt looking for a job and finding a job, especially when it was a mass layoff, are two different things
[0:37:19] yeahs1: Blizzard is a membership, not a company to work in
[0:37:19] Achny01: War within you say?

[0:38:25] Sphexs: @TheRealJinjix you're a number at any job
[0:38:55] stljay73: @Mak2349 why would you ever think you are anything but a number, just like they are just a means to get money for your life
[0:38:56] Geri_0123: KEKW
[0:39:04] Shelana95: Just buy a boost xD
[0:39:16] fifty3three50: Are you planning to do something along with Nick from T&E? That could be fun.
[0:39:17] BuckyDK: The silly little  bucking dragons lmao
[0:39:22] ravenofjudgement: @Methuzahla was reffreing to when Mike said they were being told for a year they are getting fired.
[0:39:37] Red_Fr0st_: Wank Joe
[0:39:39] Shelana95: Not surpriced
[0:39:39] TheRealJinjix: @stljay73 Easy to do when it's your first "real job" you have for over 14 years in my case. I certainly know that "Now".
[0:39:57] ScouseDonkey: Ooo I'm in the strum ,Hi Mom !

[0:40:28] Mak2349: @TheRealJinjix hope you're in a better place now

[0:41:24] BuckyDK: Now she'll be replaced with an uncaring AI :(
[0:41:26] SinRedblade: I was going to drop a one month sub on WoW then I saw how MS/Blizz did 1900 ppl dirty and said fuck em
[0:41:30] Mak2349: @TheRealJinjix <3
[0:41:33] Entropy_NZ: CM actually being involved with the community is rare, but awesome.

[0:43:27] OniScythe: That sucks
[0:43:27] Synckery: honestly INSANE
[0:43:30] TheRealJinjix: Its so heartbreaking that more have to go through it.

[0:43:44] hiraikou: Sadge
[0:43:48] UniqeornRider: sadly that's what happens with corporate mergers Sadge
[0:44:22] Entropy_NZ: Must be someone who's otherwise uninvolved just picking out certain roles, and paint-by-numbers-ing the lay-offs.
[0:44:46] cerolith: clueless bureaucrats in Microsoft making those decisions
[0:44:46] Naethix: GGG is BiS

[0:45:34] Vinestra28: Clueless US team has got it covered. Don't worry about it.
[0:45:34] FILLAN88: I'd quit on the spot every time, screw that, let Microsoft UK plan it
[0:45:38] Maze_0f_Torment: If they needed me so badl;y, they wouldnt fire me. Now they need me and firing me, I would walk away and quit
[0:45:44] TattersAU: I had assumed most of the Blizz layoffs were Overwatch based LUL
[0:45:46] Aknikai: why puit in efford when you get axed anyway?
[0:45:57] fifty3three50: I wouldn't do shit. Scroll LinkedIn and indeed on company time.
[0:46:00] Mak2349: How the fuck are you supposed to do your job when you know they'll just sack you???
[0:46:03] AtomJar: @FILLAN88 jobs are hard to come by and id imagine money is needed
[0:46:05] Daranun: Daranun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 32 month streak! finally baldurs gate is over, so i can be watching again. Gonna catch up with the VoDs once im done with it myself
[0:46:07] Jauffre_: Streamer curse
[0:46:09] TheRealJinjix: @TattersAU They fully deleted their new Survival game team too, it sucks
[0:46:12] ponchemann: They change the good person and keep the people who are ruining the game. What the fuck.
[0:46:16] AngryFil: i love the managers who tell people they'll lose their jobs once management has figured out how to operate without them and expect those people to continue working as usual
[0:46:19] realnzall: @Preachlfw Didn't Lore quit so he could move to another company?
[0:46:20] SkelebobTV: @Preachlfw to be very clear "At Risk" doesn't mean fired, I've been at Risk twice but been kept on
[0:46:24] Vinestra28: @FILLAN88 Shruge I got bills to pay

[0:46:26] KelticNight: seeing people saying others where "overblowing the layoffs" was such a clown shoe moment. so many good people losing their jobs
[0:46:38] SZebra: Long-term I can see XBOX re-focussing on US communities. Even setting aside the layoffs it seems likely that the EU are going to be left out in the cold.
[0:46:43] Nupss: timezones too PepeHands
[0:46:48] Geri_0123: @Mak2349 by doing the bare minimum I assume, at least that's what people I know did  (not game industry tho, just general software)
[0:46:49] TheRealJinjix: @AngryFil That was us in France 2021. When we learned we were all being fired... we still had to work for like 4/6 months after.
[0:46:57] ployboi69: KEKW
[0:47:05] Shelana95: Whaaat, they are in the US?  Shcoker
[0:47:07] gwynegaming: KKona well duh
[0:47:10] kaspiDev: "I would quit immediately" "Why put in effort?" I must resist essaying
[0:47:12] Aknikai: what are timezones? LUL
[0:47:23] Phabey: @KelticNight clowns saying that '20k seemed like a lot of employees'  to try and justify it, without any context or internal knowledge, absolute clowns

[0:47:45] DerZanael: @AngryFil I have a friend who was there too, he had been at Blizzard since right after WOW launch
[0:47:48] AngryFil: @TheRealJinjix i would expect performance to plummet
[0:48:03] YuushaEX: yeah the blizzard survival game
[0:48:05] realnzall: Cheer100 I just asked the ElvUI Discord. WoWup can still be used completely legitimately to update ElvUI, because ElvUI has their own addon API that's independent from the Curse API
[0:48:06] Mak2349: @Geri_0123 can't blame that mindset tbh
[0:48:06] OspreyRed: it‚Äôs 1:30 am here in California YEP

[0:48:13] TheRealJinjix: @AngryFil Oh dude, I rattled off about 9 tickets in the first 20m of an hour, then played FF14 off the VPN
[0:48:13] palecarnage: 1900 is a lot of folk
[0:48:15] ponchemann: The survial game was being made for 7 years and didn't have a workable demo from what I heard?
[0:48:16] monitus0: monitus0 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Molkohr! They have given 16 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:48:19] gwynegaming: 7 years and dropped the project!?
[0:48:22] YuushaEX: HUHH
[0:48:23] Maddroxv: 6 years but lets be honest it was in development hell
[0:48:23] huntaoce: HUHH
[0:48:23] alpaca_god_7000: I didn't like Mike at all
[0:48:24] shinra40: he did nothing
[0:48:25] da_phuq: imagine making game for 6 years and its so shit that they cancel it KEKW
[0:48:26] 3rayed: HUHH

[0:48:28] beskarsilver: HUHH
[0:48:28] Nupss: HUHH
[0:48:30] KelticNight: Ybarra at Blizzcon said he'd have to be dragged away from BLizzard Classic
[0:48:31] Arkangel_I: yea after 7 years and they haven't showed anything, sounds bizarre!
[0:48:31] Elydian: He's just a corpo.
[0:48:34] jace193: @Preachlfw did  Lore leave on his own or get dropped? he's the only one CM guy i can think of that might have left on their own terms
[0:48:36] Phabey: Ybarra proved himself to be a prick, good riddance
[0:48:36] hiraikou: KEKW
[0:48:40] AngryFil: @TheRealJinjix exactly Clap
[0:48:40] persi_enne: @Preachlfw check out Jason Schrier's tweets, he gives more context
[0:48:41] Shelana95: I am glad he is gone
[0:48:41] OspreyRed: Shruge i don‚Äôt get it either
[0:48:43] alpaca_god_7000: You could just tell when he opened blizzcon, he felt so out of place
[0:48:44] brackers89: Decision made at the top without thought to the micro impact. Such a good way to lose talent... we see it in my industry every 18 months... board will assume you will eventually make the change and be ok
[0:48:44] SZebra: Streamer Privilege KEKW
[0:48:45] itsClubby: Mike One Of Us Ybarra
[0:48:46] Synckery: people thought he was "one of us" cus he played the game ....

[0:48:48] tordalor: boost guy leaving oj no KEKW
[0:48:49] fifty3three50: Ybarra can suck farts

[0:48:49] ponchemann: I'm glad he is gone too
[0:48:50] Maddroxv: yeh towelliee going "one of us"  over ybarra was a big LOL
[0:48:53] thavleifrim: Does overwatch even have a dev team I thought it was just people making store edits
[0:48:53] Entropy_NZ: Maybe just because it's a familiar name? Can't thin of another reason.
[0:48:54] SoulSlicer808: Ybarra is a turd
[0:48:59] Vinestra28: @Synckery He was how do you do fellow gamers NODDERS
[0:49:02] Shelana95: Nothing
[0:49:02] Nupss: @Maddroxv that comment was unhinged KEKW
[0:49:02] psn_kratos: now ybarra can stream boosts all day PepeLaugh
[0:49:04] Elydian: Also, that guy will land on his feet.
[0:49:08] Jauffre_: His tweet was so fucking tone deaf
[0:49:11] leegolas_WSS: His announcement when leaving to say hes going to travel the world was so tone deaf
[0:49:13] Synckery: @Vinestra28 YUP KEK
[0:49:15] Shelana95: Good he is gone
[0:49:16] persi_enne: Diablo Immortal <3 XD

[0:49:29] zxabu230: I made my money YEP
[0:49:30] YuushaEX: yeah feck that guy
[0:49:31] OspreyRed: YEP Hyper Growth Opportunity
[0:49:31] ponchemann: @Preachlfw Do you think Microsoft fired him or he chose to go?
[0:49:31] Elydian: Hard times, Ybarra.
[0:49:32] FezHansen: So true, Ybarra leaving is the best thing that could happen despite it being shit for the rest :(
[0:49:34] Phabey: he's the guy that claimed execs 'don't get paid much more than employees' when they cut employee bonuses, fuck him
[0:49:37] Wooodsen: hyper growth KEKW
[0:49:41] Arkangel_I: D4 üí©

[0:49:46] palecarnage: I'll give you a recommendation
[0:49:47] Shrandamar: He ran away whenever people confronted him on something, weak ass turd
[0:49:55] Geri_0123: @Phabey not like it's public info to fact check
[0:49:59] MitsuAmariyo: @Maddroxv Towelliee says some weird stuff a lot
[0:49:59] Shelana95: Good for us then
[0:50:01] TheRealJinjix: Hyper Growth Opportunities is what the fuck got them into this ion the first place
[0:50:02] SZebra: Yeah, he probably left MS for a reason.
[0:50:03] ravenofjudgement: makes sense NODDERS
[0:50:03] YuushaEX: he knew he was getting fired so wanted to leave on his own terms
[0:50:04] ratskyz: Towlie looked pretty bad with that tweet about Ybarra
[0:50:04] Elydian: Poliitics.
[0:50:07] Morujin: He is traveling the world because he cant join another game dev company
[0:50:10] daedri: also don't need to spend millions on someone Phil probably can do.
[0:50:17] itsClubby: Wait Mike, you dont think he was planted at Blizzard to help with the merger? @Preachlfw
[0:50:18] Brinnleybtw: ALOO
[0:50:19] Marach: Phil refused to promote him before...
[0:50:20] KelticNight: a few Blizz execs make millions during the takeover
[0:50:22] alpaca_god_7000: they always were going to be
[0:50:24] MaybeDefinitelyNot: D4 bad EZ
[0:50:25] zxabu230: D4 bad LIVESFROMBASED

[0:50:30] AngryFil: same with Bobby i presume
[0:50:31] Molkohr: @Brinnleybtw ALOO
[0:50:31] Mak2349: you could say the same about Kottick. Line went up
[0:50:34] Phabey: @Geri_0123 he's about to go off travelling the world, he's clearly not doing too badfinancially.
[0:50:38] Tibbroar: Classic people still buying blizzard games because of the name alone
[0:50:40] stljay73: @Brailee might not be another CEO, I could see MS breaking blizzard into seperate IP studios
[0:50:43] Shelana95: I celebrated him going
[0:50:45] ployboi69: Sure strummer
[0:50:45] SinRedblade: just saw the tweet about the new stream theme - holo ben dog :)
[0:50:49] ponchemann: I remember when Ybarra said he didn't know who you are. That pissed me off, honestly;
[0:50:50] fifty3three50: Immortal was a victory, no? Future of gaming is mobile.
[0:50:53] troupet: so he pulled a dan clancey?
[0:50:56] alpaca_god_7000: He didn't have much charisma

[0:51:08] Vinestra28: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Who was sad
[0:51:12] Geri_0123: @Phabey ofc at his level he would be well of if he didn't work for a day for the rest of his life
[0:51:13] Kodvir: Gotta love US employment laws
[0:51:17] Elydian: It was a layoff. It's always a layoff.
[0:51:17] palecarnage: NOPERS
[0:51:33] Entropy_NZ: I actually think D4 is a really good base game, but had some issues with itemization on launch, and doesn't have the end-game of something like PoE. Doesn't help that 2/3 seasons have been kinda crap though.
[0:51:34] SinRedblade: @Kodvir the US has empoloyment laws?
[0:51:37] Elydian: Back to office is just a cheap layoff. It's all it is.
[0:51:48] cerolith: yep
[0:51:55] Synckery: wonder what the future of blizz looks like with getting rid of survival game, if it means theyre going ALL IN on WoW it seems as its like the only game they kinda have in development still
[0:51:57] huntaoce: it's fucked
[0:52:00] Atreyu_Lavellan: It needs it really
[0:52:04] SinRedblade: @ChunkeyNinja love the holo ben dog on the new theme :)
[0:52:04] YuushaEX: NODDERS Indie games rise up
[0:52:05] Entropy_NZ: likely, yeah. Grew waaay to big too quickly too
[0:52:07] Geri_0123: the whole software industry is kinda fucked the past few months
[0:52:08] Mobitron: I'll keep giving indie devs my cash
[0:52:10] mobbeh: Riot MMO ded
[0:52:10] OspreyRed: @kodvir we protect the  ability for companies to make  choices
[0:52:11] gwynegaming: AAA is gonna be outsource outsource outsource, be the source @Preachlfw
[0:52:16] Thefatkid145: AAA is fuckes
[0:52:18] Maddroxv: well its more like "don't join the triple A game industry with any sort of feeling of Job security"triple A is ruled by C suite execs and not developers
[0:52:18] Mobitron: Palworld and Enshrouded in the same month? I'm sold.
[0:52:18] ChunkeyNinja: @SinRedblade tyty
[0:52:20] ravenofjudgement: @Preachlfw Bungie magically hired 400 people right after layoffs KEKW
[0:52:22] BlindnotdeafOCE: The Greed is crazy

[0:52:30] Vinestra28: @Elydian NODDERS layoffs by another name... It was fairly obvious they wanted to lay them off but didnt wanna pay.. so make it shit for them so they leave/have ni choice
[0:52:30] Miss_Kas: It also takes them too long to get games out

[0:52:40] Marach: nearly all the SE stuff
[0:52:40] Atreyu_Lavellan: RE3 was the shit one

[0:52:48] FILLAN88: Larger number = Bigger better
[0:52:50] maegnis: @ravenratt It still makes me feel insane that that happened. God I hate what Bungie has become
[0:52:51] Ractorious: 3 was bad, of course it was disappointing
[0:52:51] Selverya: every Square Enix game that sells well = disappointing for them
[0:52:52] felwink: yea they saying spiderman 3 needs to sell ~17mil copies at full RRP to break even or something, insane
[0:52:55] troupet: I mean I remember when square enix would say there were disappointing sales for tomb raider a few years back

[0:53:10] AtomJar: i mean im sure GTA 6 will save the idea of big budget games again
[0:53:11] SoulSlicer808: If they were disappointed, they had unrealistic forecasts
[0:53:12] ponchemann: Cyberpunk sold something like around 18 million and shareholders were disappointed too.
[0:53:13] countrycount: @Entropy_NZ every Squenix game is a "disapointing release" according to squenix
[0:53:14] MikuMonday: @Green_Chocobo it was Forspoken that was a giant failure
[0:53:17] persi_enne: Tomb Raider sold 10 mill and was dissapointing so SE sold the studio XD
[0:53:18] grimeylive: I don't think they would've made 3 and 4 remake if 2 did bad
[0:53:18] 3rayed: re4 remake?

[0:53:36] Traion: Tomb Raider selling 6 million copies and being disapointing
[0:53:37] Warskippy: hey preach. goodmorning
[0:53:37] Plinglebob: It's not just greed, costs have driven dramatically, but even with a wider audience base prices haven't gone up enough to cover with a return % that beats sticking the money in an investment fund

[0:57:16] Braggardt: BG3 had a budget of 100m? crazy
[0:57:17] shinra40: BG3 got so many non DND/turn base players into that genre which quite amazing

[0:57:46] Wodiin: @ravenratt I mean me being a fan doesnt change I am still a poor
[0:57:48] Yr_Helwyr: @lobstermotel It's the quality of it but it is no way a AAA game compared to games like Starfield, CoD or whatever - it's in the way it was made and developed
[0:57:50] Ahrmanhamma: Cyberpunk ended up being pretty solid, just not the game a lot of people wanted
[0:57:58] Mendo_ksi: except noone will play palworld in like 3 months. It's just a "hype" thing fueled by advertising. There is not a lot of long lasting games in the market
[0:57:58] Mak2349: BG3 is still in 7th place on Steams 24 hour peak LUL

[1:01:26] alwiro: jeeeesus
[1:01:33] cerolith: the same people who buy madden and fifa

[1:01:51] mobbeh: FIFA
[1:01:52] Sleeping______: FIFA, Roblox, Fortnite
[1:01:52] Geri_0123: With the amount of ad providers not filtering for malware in the ads they server, adblock is a must
[1:01:53] Zabraxa: Fifa Ultimate team
[1:01:54] Shelana95: FIFA
[1:01:55] Lctl10: Pokemon ?

[1:02:01] Kodvir: Pokemon
[1:02:01] Wodiin: Fortnite for sure
[1:02:02] Lithirrdys: @Traion profit is in the micro transactions though NODDERS need that horse armour
[1:02:03] the_inactivewall: genshin
[1:02:03] Moebka: fortnite
[1:02:04] Polebegood: i'm sure the in-app purchases make more money than the games themselves
[1:02:04] Entropy_NZ: Pokemon still the most profitable franchise of all time.
[1:02:04] jako347: fifa fortnite gta5
[1:02:04] Morujin: Genshin?
[1:02:04] daris888: fifa for sure

[1:02:05] OspreyRed: GTA 5
[1:02:07] ployboi69: Genshin
[1:02:11] BogzyMan: many mobile games are pc/console too now
[1:02:11] ausYenLoWang: GTA5 is crazy profitable with online and shark cards
[1:02:11] Entropy_NZ: in movies/games etc
[1:02:15] Sleeping______: oh, ye forgot Genshin, i don't play weeb games so i forget
[1:02:16] BogzyMan: thats the future
[1:02:19] librengbigas: when people say a game is a "failure," it's hard to tell if they're referring to poor sales or negative reception
[1:02:21] ployboi69: HUHH

[1:02:29] Syrjyys: Funny how FIFA ain't FIFA anymore cause two could greedy corps couldn't find an agreement
[1:02:29] Sleeping______: That is definitely NOT correct
[1:02:32] Entropy_NZ: doubt this list tbh
[1:02:32] kickya_lipsoff: d4 made nearly a billion
[1:02:34] ployboi69: FUCKING HOW D4?
[1:02:35] kickya_lipsoff: it was crazy
[1:02:36] skuull23: @Sleeping______ exactly even islands were fine, if it was option content as doing it occasionally, (same as torgast) essences were good tooand had cinematics throught expansion which never had in any other expansion
[1:02:37] BuckyDK: sportsball games lmao
[1:02:38] Entropy_NZ: no Honkai on there?
[1:02:39] Phobion: S3 is tragic
[1:02:40] Shelana95: Yeah Diablo was great the first week
[1:02:41] PanzerID: people had misguided hope for D4
[1:02:45] Allessii: diablo IV is like heroin
[1:02:45] Sleeping______: That looks like sales not revenue/MTX
[1:02:46] Miyu_Fhey: And it works for casual arpg fans
[1:02:46] Lctl10: D4 sold super well. it just turned into a fiasco after
[1:02:47] Lithirrdys: Sure its diablo they like and not lillith
[1:02:47] AgrM_Gengar: lot of people bought diablo 4 and then stopped playing after 2 weeks
[1:02:47] Geri_0123: D4 was fine if you are not an ARPG player, just play the campaign, fuck around then leavee
[1:02:47] Elydian: It's insane to me that D4 cash chop even makes money. The skins are so boring.
[1:02:47] mobbeh: I bet FIFA buries them all because of microtransactions
[1:02:48] AtomJar: @Traion GTA 5 sold 25mil in its first year apparently. and gaming is bigger and more acepted now
[1:02:49] Dernsby: People really liked the initial campaign, most people just play that.
[1:02:49] Mak2349: I guess but it's fucking predatory
[1:02:49] Radrez: loved* diablo ;)
[1:02:52] Ziracc: everyone bought D4 on release
[1:02:53] Fingle1: campaign for d4 was sick, that seems to have been forgotten
[1:02:55] Faulty_F: Why does 16 have 15 thumbnail? LUL
[1:02:57] kickya_lipsoff: @Dernsby ^^
[1:02:57] OspreyRed: great to see Street Fighter 6 do so well
[1:02:57] Mobitron: D4 isn't even bad, it's just not good.
[1:02:58] Bendix10: Reviews was not to bad aswell
[1:02:59] Catkillerfive: most people who play diablo just played the campaign and left
[1:02:59] MoonKyun: @Entropy_NZ Star rail does not have established customer income like Genshin running for 2-3 years
[1:02:59] countrycount: oh please don't ask how...you guys think twitch viewers are anywhere close to the "Normal" game consumer?
[1:03:00] ravenofjudgement: Miyu_Fhey miyufhLove miyufhTailR
[1:03:01] alwiro: "loved"...past tense
[1:03:03] KelticNight: so many weird AI generated sites these days
[1:03:05] AltCoby: @Geri_0123 Agreed, the price was steep for just that though
[1:03:05] Fablier: xdd
[1:03:06] redroniksre: Not to mention the people like us in the know are in the minority. Most don't give a damn
[1:03:06] MoonKyun: Even though it made shitton
[1:03:08] Naethix: I enjoy D4 :)
[1:03:08] ravenofjudgement: xdd
[1:03:08] ployboi69: Based
[1:03:09] Mak2349: KEKW
[1:03:10] troupet: some microtransaction nonsense
[1:03:12] Morujin: Nah! GTA5 should be there. Does the list include old games with ingame purchase?
[1:03:12] persi_enne: No Honkai or Genshin is weird
[1:03:12] Reksanar: You didnt miss a lot
[1:03:12] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw one of various reasons
[1:03:14] LordRavenspire: @Preachlfw back to work incident
[1:03:15] Entropy_NZ: D4 isn't predatory at all.
[1:03:18] kingjacks: its true i bought d4 even though i wasnt interested in diablo. havent played since though
[1:03:20] Elydian: It's very boring after about level 60.
[1:03:20] Radrez: Radrez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! <3 mucho love
[1:03:21] Bissenz: @Preachlfw unfortunately bc of my work schedule I missed pretty much all of bg3 streams, what are you final thoughts on it?
[1:03:22] KelticNight: not bad for a 1 console game
[1:03:23] BuckyDK: If you wanna see a proper website the way the internet was supposed to look, Berkshire Hathaway's website is a prime example..
[1:03:24] Gforcez1337: Have you talked about the layoffs Mike?
[1:03:24] zxabu230: I bought D4 Aware
[1:03:25] PlexasAideron: "players" not sales lmao
[1:03:28] Koppakamarin: It will continue to sell over time tbf
[1:03:29] luzcius: I just like Diablo
[1:03:35] Vinestra28: Sure 'players'
[1:03:37] skuull23: d4 was good as base its just no end game stuff so ended up eh
[1:03:42] Shelana95: Yeah Diablo was great the first week Û†ÄÄ
[1:03:43] Sleeping______: @skuull23 yeah tbh, i think it gets way too much shit, but i think that's just cos Legion was the odd good expansion in a fucking sea of how shit WoW is haha
[1:03:44] dragothicx: TotK GIGACHAD
[1:03:48] yomiffxiv: wth where bg3
[1:03:48] KelticNight: people shit on Starfield but it still sold Shruge
[1:03:52] Mak2349: @redroniksre I need to get this in my head that most people don't follow the gaming news like us
[1:03:53] AngryFil: i'll probably buy D4 on some future sale
[1:03:55] feekdav: d4 has a good engine and thats it
[1:03:57] DzikiWegorz1223: Hogwarts Legacy, fuck yeah
[1:03:59] Vinestra28: @KelticNight TBF it was always gonna sell
[1:03:59] LasyPanda: Why are we Purple now?
[1:04:00] Gforcez1337: BG3 made 360 million dollars, I think
[1:04:03] Dreadzol: I do feel like I got my money's worth out of D4 when compared to other games, but it definitely leaves a lot to be desired when compared to PoE
[1:04:05] Wodiin: Yeah no BG3 is that because of early access?
[1:04:10] SirAppleheart: D4 isn't bad, its just not great. Its disappointing and underwhelming, but its fine.
[1:04:11] Coffeeraptor: im so glad about the 3day early access for starfield. i saw people play it early and decided not to buy it
[1:04:11] Vinestra28: @LasyPanda Team Chaos won Chaos
[1:04:13] nohomu67: catJAM
[1:04:14] Hyperionnova: I‚Äôm surprised BG3 didn‚Äôt make it, yeah
[1:04:17] Jenna_Heart: @LasyPanda Chaos
[1:04:21] hiraikou: Sadge
[1:04:23] JakeZGR: @LasyPanda Chaos
[1:04:25] KelticNight: @Vinestra28 I fell off after 2 hours on Game Pass, just don't get it myself LUL
[1:04:30] PlexasAideron: larian doesnt share sales numbers thats why. microsoft doesnt share sales numbers either, they say players because of gamepass
[1:04:32] shinra40: every wow creator is like that , one more chance another chance
[1:04:35] Saifota: larian doesnt disclose their numbers
[1:04:39] Shelana95: Agreed
[1:04:40] Kodvir: US company ignoring EU consumer base is a given at this point
[1:04:41] Allessii: its fitting War within blizzard :D
[1:04:43] onetwojango: but its war within
[1:04:44] kickya_lipsoff: Wokege
[1:04:45] KelticNight: "overlap" Despairge
[1:04:45] Lithirrdys: the war within...the microsoft gaming department
[1:04:47] Elydian: Blizz hasn't been good at making games for a while. Very much rest on their laurels.
[1:04:48] aberlourspey: That'll be exactly it.
[1:04:49] ausYenLoWang: didnt they fire ALL of the MS community teams?
[1:04:50] tyrocantus: The war within was microblizzard all along, huh
[1:04:51] majkos: war within is fitting, blizzard vs microsoft
[1:04:53] Xianir: phil is at it again
[1:04:55] Braggardt: I expect that Microsoft intends to replace them with contractors like they did with the halo series
[1:04:56] Sleeping______: shinra40 yea, i stopped watching basically anyone, fucking painful
[1:04:56] skuull23: @Sleeping______ probably true and started expansion with really bad grinding for neck/azerite armour
[1:04:57] Miyu_Fhey: Yaaa and the already overworked QA team can do QA for all of blizzard and activision too KEKW
[1:04:58] ravenofjudgement: @Preachlfw just get your Twitch Account Manager to contact Blizzard Community Manager LUL
[1:04:58] Bissenz: Is not normal for mega corps to down size after an acquisition @Preachlfw
[1:04:59] oxoKumakichioxo: investors are plague in the industry
[1:05:01] ployboi69: KEKW
[1:05:02] Hyperionnova: ah makes sense if Larian didn‚Äôt reveal their numbers
[1:05:03] SirAppleheart: @Preachlfw and supposedly the whole Game Master team, globally, is going boom :(
[1:05:06] Yurian33: Xbox Andy
[1:05:06] Miyu_Fhey: fuuck sake microsoft
[1:05:07] Geri_0123: Larian is not a public company, you won't get numbers like that
[1:05:08] Gforcez1337: Typical MS KEKW
[1:05:11] Nupss: so explain RWF to me
[1:05:11] jovens_v: Yeah same kinda thing happened for EU riot team I believe
[1:05:11] Vinestra28: How do you fellow WoWers It is mike the XBOX guy
[1:05:11] ChunkeyNinja: @Preachlfw double music
[1:05:13] PlexasAideron: it wasnt redundancy, they fired people that were 20 years in the company
[1:05:19] Decadence001: nah, you'll end up with an AI chatbot @Preachlfw
[1:05:22] Sleeping______: didn't the GM team go boom like 20 yearsago lol?
[1:05:24] BuckyDK: Yea great, CS brought to you by Bing AI... "My character is gone! what do I do?" "Weed-eater"
[1:05:25] kickya_lipsoff: Honestly I think wow is actually in a decent spot for now and the future seems promising at least @Preachlfw
[1:05:27] Entropy_NZ: @ChunkeyNinja it's kinda working though haha
[1:05:28] ponchemann: @Preachlfw what's your excitement for War Within btw?
[1:05:31] KelticNight: Fallout 76's CM got laid off too. MS must be moving them in house or contracting it out
[1:05:31] Vinestra28: @PlexasAideron 20 years in are expensive tbf
[1:05:32] DarkSafka: If you just look at data, community management doesn't make any money directly so you can just cut it off to save money Shruge propably something like that. Which is stupid.
[1:05:33] ausYenLoWang: @Preachlfw hasnt MS said they were outsourcing those CS roles
[1:05:33] PlexasAideron: austin customer support was razed and outsourced
[1:05:35] alwiro: can't be worse than shadowlands soooo.... Kappa
[1:05:44] persi_enne: Also they are getting rid of their physical game staff, so all MS games are gonna be digital @Preachlfw
[1:05:49] siren_industries: sireni18WIZZARD sireni18WIZZARD sireni18WIZZARD
[1:05:50] SirAppleheart: US team is gone already
[1:05:52] Elydian: That's what will happen.
[1:05:55] Lithirrdys: they made big cuts to QA too. you NEVER cut back on QA morons will end up with a broken game and wonder why customers are pissed
[1:05:56] purplenbrown: microsoft is succesfully killing every studio they bought, blizzard wont be different
[1:06:08] Vinestra28: Despairge

[1:10:32] Miyu_Fhey: oh yea the state of sickness when you feel it coming sucks
[1:10:32] ponchemann: I would honestly prefer a WoW2 for something going forward than another 6 years of expansions
[1:10:51] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @ponchemann They probably will never do a wow2
[1:10:53] SinRedblade: Mike is down with the sickness KEKW
[1:10:54] daCasca: ah another expansion. time for me to get 1 month game time and then decide that I don't have eneough time to play
[1:10:56] Vinestra28: @ponchemann Shruge the fuck would a wow 2 offer
[1:10:57] MitsuAmariyo: I believe in Metzen returning Thrall to be a front and center of stuff, that's about it
[1:11:35] daCasca: i think he went to the shitter
[1:11:37] AwakenRevelation: @Preachlfw are you a part of Generation X by chance? Or does anyone in chat know if he is?
[1:11:40] KelticNight: i mean the story was still pretty uninspiring when Metzen was there, so... PepeLaugh
[1:11:50] MitsuAmariyo: @KelticNight Exactly
[1:11:53] Sleeping______: there is NO WAY WoW (retail) can be any good with the amount of fucking bloat in the game, it's crazy.
[1:11:58] SinRedblade: Mike is a boomer :D
[1:11:58] Vinestra28: @AwakenRevelation NOPERS he's the forgotten generatoion
[1:11:58] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @AwakenRevelation Preach is the older end of the millenial generation
[1:12:00] alwiro: @AwakenRevelation he's like 60
[1:12:11] Dernsby: Pretty interested for the alpha to come out just to see what they do with all the hero talent trees, there was some parts in the ones that were shown
[1:12:13] Phabey: I don't get all the 'WoW 2' stuff. It's so nebulous, what does it even mean? The current game basically is a 2.0 compared to the vanilla - cata days, it's a completely different game
[1:12:14] Bashiel: he's over 9000
[1:12:14] hiraikou: @AwakenRevelation Oldge
[1:12:15] OspreyRed: chat is full of haters KEKW
[1:12:19] Geri_0123: @KelticNight but it mostly made sense, and was cool (not deep or particularly well written)
[1:12:21] stljay73: WoW needs to dump all the "Competitive" type content and get back to being a RP game
[1:12:22] deathdotcom: I believe it's about time we had a WoW 2, I don't think there's anything left that this engine or this timeline can offer, a complete overhaul is due.
[1:12:36] SinRedblade: @OspreyRed Memes sir, memers KEKW
[1:12:42] daCasca: @alwiro didn' he start the whole youtube thing when he retired?
[1:12:44] Dirtymonroe: I will buy 5 100‚Ç¨ copies, just to fuck with the haters xD
[1:12:48] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @deathdotcom Yeah, probably ain't gonna happen
[1:12:51] wenzkuze: why is preach purple
[1:12:55] Sleeping______: @KelticNight yep, 100% - he's literally a puppet/meme, the megafans just can't regulate emotion so they go into meltdowns and just imagine some fantasy, which won't exist xD
[1:13:00] Vinestra28: @SinRedblade Now now he's not that young. He's the Silent Generation
[1:13:01] alwiro: @deathdotcom that would require MS and blizz to care.
[1:13:08] Fingle1: @Shelana95 i've been spamming m+ this season already
[1:13:08] OspreyRed: @sinredblade a lot of people seem genuinely bitter KEKW
[1:13:10] Mobitron: I just realized what purple ya'll were talking about. It's such a good look
[1:13:16] snuffles_80: catJAM

[1:13:18] ScouseDonkey: @deathdotcom They did Overwatch  2 so well, why not !
[1:13:21] AwakenRevelation: I'm part of Gen X, I had some hope, at least Preach, and some of chat, of course, appears to still have some common sense =P
[1:13:26] Dernsby: @OspreyRed Some major "Stop having fun vibes." from some

[1:13:35] nzcorona: will preach play SoD
[1:13:36] SinRedblade: @OspreyRed well one or two, you alwayts get a few, but most of us just meme the shit out of him :D
[1:13:40] OspreyRed: @dernsby for sure NODDERS
[1:13:43] deathdotcom: @Dragonnan_Drakelos they're going to milk current wow until there's nothing left, which is sad tbh, instead of being pro-active.

[1:19:32] ponchemann: how does it feel playing BG3 and going back to WoW
[1:19:36] Mak2349: I miss the Legion class stories Sadge
[1:19:38] ScouseDonkey: I actually have no idea wtf happened in Shadowlands, and i actually played all of it
[1:19:46] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Entropy_NZ Shadowlands story was decent (aside from Sylvanas and Jailer stuff) before the "city of secrets" stuff came in 9.1. What even was the name? Can't remember.
[1:19:47] nohomu67: @Mak2349 NODDERS

[1:20:09] SupoxFlytrap: @ScouseDonkey you're better off that way, trust me
[1:20:16] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Entropy_NZ Ahh, yeah, Korthia, thanks. That was a fucking disappointment, innit?
[1:20:17] realnzall: @Preachlfw sorry, was in a meeting. i asked the ElvUI discord, they support updating ElvUI through WoWup, because it's through their own API, not Curseforge's
[1:20:18] LuiBMHunter: bad Mikek not looting kills

[1:20:52] Mak2349: @KelticNight I sadly agree Sadge

[1:21:15] tomdotdll: @KelticNight legion was the last time you genuinely had fun
[1:21:39] forevrzero: just put up your commander tag
[1:21:43] rhychan: rhychan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! dies to MSQ mobs lol
[1:21:44] ravenofjudgement: @Preachlfw gameplay is the only thing I miss
[1:21:54] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @KelticNight I'm kinda okay with Dragonflight too. Story is weird in some places, but I'd place it as my top 3rd expansion.
[1:22:02] realnzall: @Preachlfw Is Bits TTS on?
[1:22:04] DrPruning: @preachlfw where would you put baldur gate 3 in your list of top rpg? above dos2?
[1:22:13] metavahn231: why is anduin so dramatic all of a s udden
[1:22:19] SirAppleheart: I keep trying to get into FFXIV, because of all the praise its story gets, but the combat just throw me out every time
[1:22:21] metavahn231: in trailer kek

[1:22:26] SirAppleheart: I wish I could play WoW in FFXIV :D
[1:22:34] Mak2349: played a bit of DF and yeah WoW is king when it comes to pressing buttons
[1:22:37] Geri_0123: @bluecesti he was kinda mindraped by the jailer/sylvanas
[1:22:46] Azikielboi: players get mad when u nerf cds

[1:22:48] KelticNight: pop cd's PepegaSword
[1:22:48] RMA_90: is it season 4 or 3?
[1:22:48] AtomJar: @Dragonnan_Drakelos big part to is coming back you miss a ton of satory as this is the first time they have done so much story in .5 and .7 patches
[1:22:50] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @SirAppleheart Yeah, combat is really different from WoW. If you go in with any expectations, you're not gonna like it.
[1:22:50] Azikielboi: "it doesnt feel good"
[1:22:51] jovens_v: popping the 2 minutes time to pump NODDERS
[1:22:57] Mobitron: The gameplay is fun. I just wish the game was fun.
[1:23:02] Mak2349: FF14 is amazing but gameplay wise it's miles away
[1:23:05] Vinestra28: HACKERMANS CD's popped lets go
[1:23:18] SirAppleheart: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Yeah, exactly. Coming from GW2 and WoW, FFXIV just feels so dull to play, in terms of just the combat mechanics.
[1:23:18] MrBorisPavlov: time for BoomerDisco ?
[1:23:22] realnzall: @Preachlfw I asked elvUI Discord btw. They host a separate and free API for their addons that WoWup is free to use
[1:23:26] steelfurspeaks: I need my CDs to feel like a god
[1:23:34] Vinestra28: Oldge Forgot his keybinds
[1:23:40] hiraikou: Oldge
[1:23:42] Kayvonnn: how long are you fingers to reach shift F1
[1:23:49] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Dragonnan_Drakelos It takes some getting used to, that's for sure. I like both WoW and FF14 combat, just for different reasons
[1:23:52] steelfurspeaks: Wowup is goated
[1:23:57] JakeZGR: Time for BoomerDisco
[1:24:02] ravenofjudgement: Time for BoomerDisco
[1:24:13] Shelana95: Never heard of WOWup
[1:24:14] pupkat: @Preachlfw did you change logo color on twitch?
[1:24:17] scrubbybubbles42: power auras

[1:24:28] Knonme21: BoomerDisco
[1:24:31] Geri_0123: I  used cursebreaker, nice CLI tool to update/install sstuff
[1:24:37] nohomu67: PepeLaugh Just can't survive it
[1:24:47] fulhamfan25: have you tried any other classes this expansion?
[1:24:48] SirAppleheart: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Yeah, I get that. I am sure I will too, I just need to get past that initial barrier and "get it", you know?
[1:24:50] Vinestra28: @KelticNight and we used to ride on the ground non of this new fangled flying Oldge
[1:24:53] Rotsel: wow is... back?
[1:24:55] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw I kinda know the answer to my question, but I'mma shoot anyway: Do you plan on updating your "UI pack" in TWW perchance?
[1:25:00] TheFuriyon: I kept trying to slide cast when I got back into wow recently, sufficed to say I died a few times to my FF muscle memory KEKW @Preachlfw
[1:25:03] Entropy_NZ: @SirAppleheart depends on the class. Try playing somethign like Ninja if you're finding it slow. It's very slow early on, but on a class with lots of oGCDs it's just as fast
[1:25:15] nohomu67: PauseChamp
[1:25:15] mr_az3k: FF14s combat is what stopped me from getting past reborn. poopoo
[1:25:17] erodhar96: amirdrasil is a b√§nger
[1:25:21] Phobion: KEKW
[1:25:24] LuiBMHunter: You scared im!
[1:25:24] erodhar96: And I know b√§ngers
[1:25:26] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Dragonnan_Drakelos People usually say that FF14 has a moment where the combat just "clicks" and it's smooth sailing from there
[1:25:26] nohomu67: peepoFingerLeave
[1:25:27] Tartuccio: NOPERS
[1:25:36] itsKhro: itsKhro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 89 months! His queue popped
[1:25:37] Mak2349: watching this makes me miss my warrior so much. My very first character
[1:25:37] Phobion: gone like the Jailer KEKW @Preachlfw
[1:25:40] SirAppleheart: @Entropy_NZ Yeah, thats fair. I've mostly just played Warrior and Bard so far
[1:25:45] realnzall: @Preachlfw Regarding WoWup: They have 2 app versions, one that supports Curseforge and 1 that supports wago.io, but you need to allow ads if you want to use either one
[1:25:47] alwiro: snek
[1:25:51] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Entropy_NZ I main WAR
[1:25:59] KelticNight: @Vinestra28 Riding on the ground? you must've been rich. I had to be dragged around on a used cabbage leaf by a friend Oldge
[1:26:09] Mak2349: Momma?
[1:26:13] nohomu67: YEP
[1:26:20] hiraikou: uuh
[1:26:21] Fingle1: knaifu is coming back  so all is good
[1:26:23] RMA_90: I still cant get over the fact that we just had to take the batteries off jailer's back to get rid of him
[1:26:24] SoulSlicer808: I hope they give more previews on the elite trees coming in War Within
[1:26:24] KelticNight: sound bite in 3... 2...
[1:26:25] SirAppleheart: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Nice! I play a Lala with a proper Magnum PI tash, and a big axe :D
[1:26:25] Morghdred017: mommy coming? im siding with mommy then :P
[1:26:25] crashuloxd: After Jailer will there be Gulager?
[1:26:26] Entropy_NZ: bard is pretty APM heavy much later on. Pretty fun class. Ninja and Monk take the cake, i think
[1:26:37] Wingey: monk and DRG are my fav
[1:26:39] nohomu67: pogSNEAK
[1:26:42] Mak2349: Epic sneaking KEKW

[1:26:58] Dernsby: @SoulSlicer808 Supposedly all of them are coming with the Alpha.
[1:27:00] MrEdnooki: Tauren rogue
[1:27:06] fripple4: @SirAppleheart also depends on your level and what content you're doing. lower levels and stuff for everyone are very simple mechanically.
[1:27:09] mr_az3k: SNU SNU
[1:27:12] SirAppleheart: @Entropy_NZ Yeah, I think either way I just need to stick with it for now. I am only like level 45ish, so I know I have a long way to go
[1:27:15] KelticNight: LUL
[1:27:16] ravenofjudgement: D:
[1:27:17] Mak2349: the animations KEKW
[1:27:20] nohomu67: Prayge I hope they improve their horribly jank in-engine cutscenes
[1:27:23] jjpunk666: So cruel....
[1:27:27] KelticNight: was it always this janky?
[1:27:38] metavahn231: bring back jailer
[1:27:43] ravenofjudgement: why...do...they...talk...like...that....
[1:27:51] Geri_0123: @SirAppleheart the way the game backloads abilities on higher level makes low lvl gameplay  kinda painful
[1:27:58] nohomu67: @ravenratt Shruge It's EPIC
[1:27:58] Infydar: Man, how the mount appears when called is so cool
[1:28:02] Phobion: coming from BG3, i need to readjust my mind not to expect that quality üôà
[1:28:05] Shelana95: Yeah they are nice, Maybe more / longer, and it will be better
[1:28:06] alwiro: @Mak2349 gotta work with what you have :D
[1:28:08] enzo_08310: it is at the same level as mobile game ads
[1:28:23] whiskeyjack03: @ravenratt to sound more menacing? Shruge
[1:28:31] FrenchFraies: catJAM
[1:28:32] RMA_90: did they not make voiceover addon for retail yet
[1:28:35] Lithirrdys: ratJAM
[1:28:38] KelticNight: Epic Music‚Ñ¢ POGGERS
[1:28:46] Mak2349: The in game cutscenes have a sort of nostalgic Warcraft 3 feel
[1:28:46] Entropy_NZ: @SirAppleheart other thing that often makes that feel worse is that they often rebalance the earlier skills/spells every expansion. So with the cap being 90, classes at 50 are waaay simpler than they would have been when 50 was the level cap. But it gets a LOT better from where you are. It's genuinely really good at endgame.
[1:28:56] Hydere: where is this music from?
[1:28:57] deathdotcom: @Preachlfw change transmog
[1:28:57] Braggardt: BANGER
[1:29:15] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Dragonnan_Drakelos AFter level 56, WAR barely needs a healer
[1:29:16] tyrew0rm: i feel like I know this music from somewhere

[1:29:26] alwiro: it is tiime
[1:29:41] Mak2349: ratJAM
[1:29:43] Wingey: yeah level syncing below 50 feels like shit after tasting lvl90
[1:29:51] Lithirrdys: HUHH sun knickers?
[1:29:55] Mak2349: @Ratscior for me at least KEKW
[1:30:16] alwiro: the last part of every sentence is funny :D
[1:30:20] SirAppleheart: On another note, didt anyone else play Enshrouded this past weekend? Its a helluva game, for EA and all
[1:30:24] Entropy_NZ: this music makes this dialogue way more epic

[1:33:53] def_glitch: The DF story was an absolutey trainwreck. The tie-in novel was delayed because it probably had to be rewritten, because they had to adjust the DF story so much due to cutting content.

[1:38:56] erodhar96: Not really, just mute the ones who yap
[1:38:59] Lithirrdys: as someone who raided in vanilla, voice comms with 40+ people all wanting to talk at once was ear cancer
[1:38:59] alwiro: probably because microphones back then were utter shit and sounded garbage :D
[1:39:02] Zimmerh: @Shelana95 at this point its just nothing more then a fun fact it happened nearly 16 years ago
[1:39:05] TheFuriyon: I take pride in knowing that being an elitist group is danish EZ
[1:39:07] Mirilendriel: So long as you're able to hear the Raid Lead, you don't need to talk
[1:39:10] ravenofjudgement: there's no way to avoid clicks tho

[1:39:31] Yurian33: theres no avoiding cliques anyways... people going to associate with who they want in any case
[1:39:51] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Lithirrdys Our guild just went from 10-11 (mostly) IRL friends to like 15-20 people to finally counter scheduling issues in current raid tier..... It's a bitch sometimes even with so few people.

[1:42:47] Shelana95: @Fingle1 What you playing these days ?
[1:42:51] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw I kinda know the answer to my question, but I'mma shoot anyway: Do you plan on updating your "UI pack" in TWW perchance? Or ever, if you have the time?
[1:42:51] erodhar96: Dont really understand why they did away with that? It felt way cooler to wrap up in a scenario
[1:42:53] Khalus90: new logo Pog
[1:42:54] Mirilendriel: They could use the NPC companion system for mini dungeons like in the tutorial

[1:43:11] Xythana: take the page out of FFXIV book - have the default difficulty as a lil harder and if you fail can retry on lower difficulty

[1:44:10] Gubchan: is she gonna sit on the eye while meditating? HUH
[1:44:13] Zoglaar: I think the main issue is that all is done by npc and your involvement is not relevant
[1:44:13] erodhar96: Insanely mushy
[1:44:15] Arkangel_I: @urbish_ FF was developed with that tech in mind. I'm guessing they do the difficulty levels manually which will take a lot of time if they decide to implement something like that.
[1:44:19] Sprakenheit: Aye aye

[1:52:41] OmegaSyntaX: Dadgar
[1:52:45] Shelana95: Dadgar
[1:52:52] interztellar: Cool as a cucumber
[1:52:54] Mirilendriel: Khadgar, the actual main character of WoW, is here at last!
[1:53:13] PaganFlute: plot device inc. ^^
[1:53:25] stljay73: @Mirilendriel Kadgar been in DF since beginning, he was in Azura Span
[1:53:25] Wodiin: That would be a classic Khadgar move though
[1:53:26] AngryFil: @Mirilendriel ain't that Gamon?
[1:53:29] Shelana95: He is reading
[1:53:32] mordbreygon: maybe he's causing it...
[1:53:34] SinicalDev: Forgot to renew his passport
[1:53:42] Mak2349: Or Jaina, or Thrall, or Anduin modCHECK
[1:53:45] KelticNight: does Khadgar still laugh then shit himself if you keep clicking him?
[1:53:46] Shelana95: I want a new wow movie !
[1:53:51] Entropy_NZ: they should just write him to have a massive coke addiction. Good excuse to not be where's he's needed.
[1:53:52] Shelana95: I really liked it
[1:53:55] Dragonnan_Drakelos: Ohhgod, don't do another movie, please
[1:53:56] Zabraxa: next WOW movie is COPIUM Sadge
[1:54:05] Entropy_NZ: and we all know the best mages are crack fiends
[1:54:07] Mobitron: @Entropy_NZ that would be fantastic
[1:54:08] Yurian33: I want the movie to be animated not live action
[1:54:13] Geri_0123: him as Arthas would be great
[1:54:14] Lithirrdys: get liam hemsworth in as arthas KEKW
[1:54:18] Shelana95: it was yes
[1:54:21] AngryFil: Willem Dafoe is Arthas? Pog
[1:54:21] nerefwow: It was huge in China
[1:54:27] OmegaSyntaX: only for China
[1:54:27] zoxalot: it was crazy profitable in china
[1:54:28] FatedMuse: The plot of wow <-----> The plot of wow if Kadghar was attentive<->
[1:54:43] crashuloxd: The Rock as Arthas NODDERS
[1:54:44] Mirilendriel: I actually liked the Warcraft movie for what it was
[1:54:45] FatedMuse: william dafoe as kelthuzad
[1:54:47] def_glitch: The film was considered a "box office flop" because America only counts itself, it was a huge hit in China though
[1:54:49] interztellar: Chris Pratt as Arthas PepeLaugh
[1:54:52] AngryFil: or they could always appeal to the modern audience and cast Chris Pratt as Arthas
[1:54:58] Shelana95: Henry Cavil all  the way. But I think he may be scared to join these projects after Witcher @Preachlfw
[1:54:59] Entropy_NZ: @interztellar or Jack Black
[1:55:00] UniqeornRider: saw fanmade art of Cavil as Arthas it was perfection
[1:55:00] porridgeu: Vince McMahon as Nerzhul
[1:55:01] SinicalDev: Microsoft will give it to Paramount like Halo :)
[1:55:02] Dernsby: The orcs were really good.
[1:55:04] Tyras92: I really hope they start clearing out the overpowered "side" characters as now we are basicly just the guys that are send to stall for time
[1:55:09] mattbman: Willem Dafoe as Kel'thuzzad
[1:55:10] Twinbros2: So Preach...City of Heroes is back, ya gonna try? lmao
[1:55:11] PanzerID: @interztellar ü§°
[1:55:12] Mak2349: it was a decent action flick but as a WoW movie meh
[1:55:15] Entropy_NZ: Make it a musical
[1:55:15] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @porridgeu AHAHHAHAHHAHAAAHHAHA
[1:55:16] mordbreygon: wait morose was in the movie?
[1:55:17] dreadvaine: the guy in the painting from ghostbuster 2 for arthas
[1:55:17] Wodiin: They need the dude playing Reacher to do Arthas. Just make him full chad.
[1:55:24] KelticNight: @Preachlfw WoW movie made 439 million dollars worldwide, needed 450-500 to break even
[1:55:28] plznoplz1111: @porridgeu KEKW
[1:55:33] redroniksre: Seeing the brief Avatar was pretty hype though
[1:55:36] Mobitron: what did morose do of any significance in the game?
[1:55:37] Shelana95: Henry Cavil all  the way. But I think he may be scared to join these projects after Witcher. Thoughts ?
[1:55:37] mrsrockguru: mrsrockguru subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 2 month streak! mornin @Preachlfw and chat
[1:55:52] Allessii: budget + marketing
[1:55:57] Entropy_NZ: the props were done by Weta in Wellington. They're really fucking cool to see close up
[1:55:58] Mirilendriel: Jamie Lannister's actor could do a pretty good Arthas imo
[1:56:03] Mak2349: It still makes money to this day so I'm sure they made it bak now
[1:56:09] BraetonGreswold: To be fair it's warcraft 1 so it's hard to show a story that spans 10 years in game in the time they had
[1:56:10] Narsis6: Production costs dont take the marketing into account so it always needs to make more
[1:56:12] Naethix: Alpha confirmed tomorrow by preach
[1:56:16] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @KelticNight Is that the really worldwide numbers, including China? Sometimes China is missing from the "worldwide" stuff.
[1:56:20] mordbreygon: is the new city empty for others?
[1:56:21] Tyras92: @Mirilendriel Pre lichking Arthas for sure
[1:56:27] drcustard: WOW , needs a murder hobo settings with swaps out all story quests for a murder fest
[1:56:39] Shelana95: do you know who Arthas is tho ?
[1:56:40] Geri_0123: battle of hyjal could be  cool
[1:56:42] Mak2349: That could be a decent trilogy as well
[1:56:44] Wodiin: I feel like Arthas story would be a better as a tv show
[1:56:45] FatedMuse: The have to tell the story of Illadin before Arthas
[1:56:46] Dreadzol: yessssss
[1:56:48] Entropy_NZ: it's just your BG3 playthrough
[1:56:50] ravenofjudgement: Arthas did nothing wrong NODDERS
[1:56:51] Tyras92: Either Arthas story or the Illidan story
[1:56:52] mordbreygon: yeah you need someone who could do the culling properly
[1:56:54] Lithirrdys: with dead, acid covered children in the streets!
[1:56:54] Twinbros2: Yea no PG13 ullshit pls
[1:56:55] porridgeu: Aragorn as Uther
[1:56:55] Goregie: and then he turns into a blue circle POGGERS
[1:56:55] crashuloxd: Arthas story is trilogy to make
[1:56:58] FatedMuse: since they intersect in frozen throne
[1:57:00] interztellar: Ok Matt Mercer
[1:57:00] AngryFil: and then they make a series about farming apexis crystals
[1:57:01] Dragonnan_Drakelos: If they change so many unnecessary things like they did in the first movie, I'mma snore like hell
[1:57:02] Entropy_NZ: With fewer dissolved children.
[1:57:09] fulhamfan25: done well, arhats story is the only one I would recommend to someone who‚Äôs never heard of it
[1:57:10] nohomu67: PreachDisgust
[1:57:13] Azikielboi: u dont even know the illidan story KEKW
[1:57:13] SinicalDev: Hellboy style illidan lets go
[1:57:13] Jauffre_: Ah yeah it would look bad
[1:57:15] Asreyya: the story will take place on the farms from MOP
[1:57:15] Yurian33: the whole movie needs to be animatd
[1:57:16] Azikielboi: never played WC3
[1:57:16] pringlez91: WoW will finally reign supreme
[1:57:17] Tyras92: Fair nvm that
[1:57:18] skuull23: @Tyras92 illidin story with him 95% of movie with him in prison :p
[1:57:18] OmegaSyntaX: I AM my CGI
[1:57:18] KelticNight: @Dragonnan_Drakelos it does. apparently at the time it "was also only the second Hollywood release (after Terminator Genisys) to earn $100 million in China without making $100 million in the United States"
[1:57:22] PaganFlute: u got some disturbed thought from bg3... ^^
[1:57:24] pringlez91: top MMO coming thru
[1:57:24] Hydere: Illdan story is way to vast to have  1 movie
[1:57:24] MrBorisPavlov: I mean they made the orcs look really good
[1:57:26] stljay73: Arthus story? What him standing around in Icecrown foronly 40 peons come and kill him
[1:57:26] Traion: A CGIllidan if you will
[1:57:26] AngelL0ls: Whos Arthas? Is he that Blue Pixie fart at the end of Shadowlands? KEKW
[1:57:26] Amyrantha_: how i would pay to see Mike in cosplay illidan in the movie KEKW
[1:57:27] FatedMuse: I AM MY PIXELS
[1:57:27] Tyras92: @skuull23 hahaha
[1:57:27] def_glitch: But the CG was the best part about the Warcraft film
[1:57:28] fifty3three50: Hell yeah
[1:57:28] NeeK_23: it worked for Green Lantern KEKW
[1:57:29] Yurian33: WoW is not ment for live action
[1:57:30] Entropy_NZ: Not if they got Weta to do it again.
[1:57:31] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @KelticNight Damn
[1:57:34] Geri_0123: orcs looked great
[1:57:35] Azikielboi: did mike ever play WC3?
[1:57:48] UniqeornRider: a cgi movie with the quality of the new trailer would be a good call imo
[1:57:51] Traion: @NeeK_23 Ouch
[1:57:51] Mirilendriel: But hear me out, if it's CGI they could have Liam O'brien voice him
[1:57:52] FatedMuse: hey... it could be worse they could make a sylvannis movie
[1:57:53] durincort: Better idea. Muppet Wrath of the Lich King.
[1:57:58] Bunionz: Bunionz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 81 months! Good morning Mike and Chat. Good to see we are back with that toxic ex that is WoW
[1:58:00] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Mirilendriel YES
[1:58:01] str4ysheep: the real humans in the movie were out of place for the style of the movie
[1:58:02] Entropy_NZ: wait.. what?
[1:58:04] Nanthe_: D:
[1:58:05] KelticNight: who that Lich King fella? Shruge
[1:58:05] ravenofjudgement: and that could be a nice solo scenario, you and Ysera together gachiBASS
[1:58:07] Jauffre_: Ah man you should
[1:58:09] rilefors: @preachlfw when the tech is here to make blizz cinematic full movies/ series without taking 20 years I'm gonna cum
[1:58:09] steelfurspeaks: You need to play Warcraft 3
[1:58:09] DrQuackzalver: I like how the npcs who stood in ranks are now all dead on the ground
[1:58:10] Siccobluex: Wut
[1:58:12] FatedMuse: oneguylaugh
[1:58:13] DrQuackzalver: details
[1:58:17] steelfurspeaks: Reforged is fine if you've never played it
[1:58:20] Narsis6: subgoal
[1:58:21] Azikielboi: i mean, it wasnt dogshit as much as it wasnt what was promised
[1:58:21] Herpdederp117: you have played wc3? you did a whole video on it
[1:58:31] Azikielboi: they said they would redo cinematics adn they did not
[1:58:33] FILLAN88: @Preachlfw You could play reforged on old graphics mode, assuming it won't crash as it likes to
[1:58:36] Shutupandpul: mike on the toxic girlfriend once more just cant stay away
[1:58:36] jjpunk666: Story is good
[1:58:37] Mobitron: Reforged's campaign is just fine
[1:58:37] soggyshoggoth: reforged campaign is honestly totally fine
[1:58:37] skuull23: i mean the story is same as base wc3 wasnt changed
[1:58:39] Basstosa: i saw there was a warcraft 2 game someone made in it now, no idea how good that is though
[1:58:40] stljay73: I dont know this Arthus dud, I just played through WoLK and he was just a raid boss, no story
[1:58:41] Cascol: @Preachlfw Have you seen WowGrandma78 on twitch?!?! She's my idol!
[1:58:43] redroniksre: Yeah reforged is fine if you didnt do it before
[1:58:43] def_glitch: Now is a great time: There's a team of modders who are remaking the Warcraft 2 campaign (Chronicles of the Second War) in Warcraft 3 Reforged. You can play that and then play Warcraft 3.
[1:58:46] steelfurspeaks: @Azikielboi exactly, nothing to go back to if you played the first game. But for someone who never has, its great
[1:58:47] BartyBreakerDragon: @Azikielboi I think it made a bunch of missions worse, and made connectivity worse online?
[1:58:50] Entropy_NZ: Oh, do you mean you didn't play reforged? or didn't play the OG?
[1:58:50] Razzin_: If you never played original, its fine
[1:58:53] Shutupandpul: Shutupandpul subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 35 and loving it
[1:58:54] Jauffre_: You really should play it, it'll give you a lot of missing context
[1:58:55] Azikielboi: @steelfurspeaks pretty much what id say eyah
[1:58:57] Herpdederp117: @Preachlfw you played it like 9 years ago lol
[1:59:06] Azikielboi: @BartyBreakerDragon it broke custom games, connectivity is far better
[1:59:11] FILLAN88: @Preachlfw there's some differences in the campaign on new graphics, best to play it old school.
[1:59:19] crashuloxd: lookUp
[1:59:23] Azikielboi: @BartyBreakerDragon missions arent worse, or rather there were bugs adn they are fixed
[1:59:25] eaolq: @Preachlfw loving that new youtube series you've been putting out recently, amazing!
[1:59:27] MrBorisPavlov: lookUp
[1:59:28] rilefors: The new story mod that came out for reforged is the graphics I expected for reforged @preachlfw
[1:59:34] Entropy_NZ: 1 is rough
[1:59:39] Entropy_NZ: has not aged well
[1:59:39] mordbreygon: @rilefors oh?
[1:59:45] Mobitron: Warcraft 1 is quite the game...
[1:59:46] FatedMuse: haha no
[1:59:48] Azikielboi: KEKW
[1:59:51] FatedMuse: 3 maybe
[1:59:51] jjpunk666: 1 bad. 2 and 3 good
[1:59:53] soggyshoggoth: @FILLAN88 some of the missions were also changed, esp in the scourge campaign
[1:59:57] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @FILLAN88 I still just can't with the fat dreadlord. Which one did they make fat? Detheroc?
[1:59:59] realnzall: @Preachlfw The big problem with Reforged is that Blizzard released a version that was missing dozens of features from the original game AND demanded all rights to all user generated content, so they don't miss another DoTA
[2:00:00] FatedMuse: because 1-2 is just... barely related
[2:00:01] AngryFil: oh, i thought the sackbeaters were out in force
[2:00:02] Dernsby: There's a custom campaign which is the entirety of Wc2 been remade on Wc3
[2:00:05] rilefors: @mordbreygon some huge story mod recently came out, looks freaking awesome
[2:00:05] Markreivi: Warcraft 1 is rough. 2 is great but gets repetitive. 3 is BiS, but reforged fucked the campaigns up. Can't even kill children in the new patch.
[2:00:11] dragothicx: WC1 uuh
[2:00:13] FatedMuse: what most people understand was warcraft starts at 3
[2:00:15] skuull23: @Preachlfw there is a custom campaign in wc3 with wc2 story its really good
[2:00:18] Re4perILL: @Preachlfw i have a 70 boost leying around. and no idea to what to use it on xD
[2:00:20] Bladetykon: they remade warcraft 2 in warcraft 3 recently and it seems very good
[2:00:26] Narsis6: WC3 won GOTY when it came out
[2:00:43] nohomu67: @Markreivi Mike better not bother then, he wouldn't like it Sadge
[2:00:44] EazzyBreezzy: did they have the ability to hot key units in WC1?
[2:00:46] Markreivi: You had to press A for any attack move.
[2:00:48] AngryFil: @Narsis6 imagine an RTS winning GOTY nowadays
[2:00:49] stljay73: Wc1, Wc2,  Wc3 and all expansions until MoP had no story and very boring
[2:00:53] Geri_0123: playing custom games back in the day on wc3 was great
[2:00:58] FatedMuse: to its credit Vanilla, TBC, and WOTLK had covered much of the warcraft 1-2 content
[2:01:06] WavePath: @Preachlfw you could play original WC 3 not reforge one ; since you can find the classic one easy
[2:01:09] rilefors: @preachlfw wish they made drsgonflying so you could NumLock fly at normal speed and have dragonflying
[2:01:10] mordbreygon: it's interesting that WC3 still only lets you select like 14 or 16 units
[2:01:10] Azikielboi: wow that was way long ago then?
[2:01:12] Traion: @Markreivi So not for Mike then
[2:01:16] MrBorisPavlov: Come a long way since then
[2:01:17] WavePath: If you want to play the real WC 3 experience
[2:01:17] realnzall: @Preachlfw The big issue with WC3 Reforged was the dozens of missing features compared to the original
[2:01:21] Azikielboi: cuz u streamed other games like back 5 years ago
[2:01:25] Streamlabs: üòé See those cool metal posters behind Mike? Get your own with up to 33% OFF after visiting https://displate.com/PreachGaming/?art=619e85e06e135
[2:01:26] Azikielboi: so this was long long back

[2:14:12] Mirilendriel: @Mak2349 Matt voiced Minsc in BG3, replacing the original VA from 1 & 2

[2:16:33] stljay73: @Entropy_NZ WoW never really had an ingame story until MoP
[2:16:33] Azikielboi: @Entropy_NZ i mean, in the gameplay telling of the story yes, in the cinematic/narrative story aspect i quite like it
[2:16:38] ArmoryCZ: @FederalVibeInspector Friendship beam...but I was the good guy, now Fast and furious decisive family win
[2:16:47] Azikielboi: wow just tells its story very differently
[2:16:47] mobbeh: you know, I dont think he can even queue for LFR with his gear
[2:16:56] Azikielboi: and people judge it based on ffs story telling style
[2:17:04] Phabey: @mobbeh he can't KEKW
[2:17:10] Bisquetz: @Entropy_NZ i loved how it at least felt like a "fantasy epic". now it just feels like some low effort Disney shows LUL
[2:17:14] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @ArmoryCZ "Draenor is free" is my top pick
[2:17:17] FatedMuse: @ArmoryCZ tough competition "But I'm good now so we won the planet is free, oh what's that behind me just fascist light dranei" is still pretty good
[2:17:21] Hupu_a: Have not been able to join strums lately due to work so has there been any info about the mousemat from the pixel art from the subathon?
[2:17:28] Entropy_NZ: @Azikielboi outside the game, sure. But even then, it's a right mess, even at the best of times. ANd I really quite like parts of it, but it's not 'good' by any metric.
[2:17:31] ArmoryCZ: KEKW
[2:17:37] BartyBreakerDragon: @Azikielboi Idk, people were critising the story well before the exodus to FF
[2:17:48] Azikielboi: @Bisquetz are u caught up? there are some twists at the end that are really good imo
[2:17:52] KelticNight: WoW's a saturday morning cartoon, just like FF14 is an anime
[2:17:53] Syrjyys: @Phabey Gotta run the gear threadmill... to see story...

[2:18:18] Mak2349: @Azikielboi not at all, I judge it for what it is. which is mediocre at best. Or Shadowlnads level of bad at worst
[2:18:19] Geri_0123: "Carry Mike raid"
[2:18:29] Yurian33: Carry me Mommy

[2:18:50] nohomu67: NOTED "Plate wearers only"
[2:18:50] stljay73: I will have to say though it has been bettr than FF16, that was a horrible story especially since it was not an MMO
[2:18:52] Nobbel87: loot lock not raid lock
[2:18:52] mobbeh: C4M
[2:18:53] Phabey: @FederalVibeInspector it does, finishing the story he's doing now will give him the gear he needs
[2:18:54] Traion: In FF that would fill instantly LUL
[2:18:55] Bisquetz: @Azikielboi nah. honestly stopped caring completely during Shadowlands and only watched through clips and stuff.

[2:19:54] Phabey: @Amyrantha_ 5Head
[2:19:57] seraphiell31: depends on how many people you bring and the ilvl of the healers as some stuff can be easily carried by just 2 or 3

[2:20:30] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Azikielboi I'm caught up, story is decent in Dragonflight, much better than WoD after 6.0, BfA from 8.1 or SL after 9.0. But still, they are really bad at telling their stories. I love the universe to bits, but still
[2:20:38] LasyPanda: 40 man?
[2:20:52] DzikiWegorz1223: They just have bad dialogues, that's the worst part. Everybody moaning and speaking like some lore book

[2:21:18] FatedMuse: @Dragonnan_Drakelos imagine if they just ditched the grand narrative for a game and just did like a tales around the hearth style of story through quest lines kind of expansion
[2:21:25] Azikielboi: @Dragonnan_Drakelos the twist at the end of the new patch is really cool in what it implies about what happened in the rest of the expac

[2:23:09] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Dragonnan_Drakelos I'm not saying the twist itself is bad, I'm just saying the storytelling is all over the place in quality. Story is much better in hindsight, when you read all the books, shorts, comics, whatevers they give out. At least FF14's outside-the-game material is just extra behind the scenes stuff, not as greatly important as WoW books.
[2:23:11] aftergl0w: if you are, it's because they're slowing down to make you feel better
[2:23:12] Geri_0123: and invited no priests, he is afraid of leap of faith

[2:53:00] Zir_aus: how far has our boy fallen, preach u was a blaster
[2:53:17] Dragonnan_Drakelos: I'm in a casual guild full of carefree dads and such, we steamrolled the raid mostly on heroic, 5 pulls on Smolderon, 2 pulls on Council and Larodar, 3 pulls on Tindral.... And we barely touched P2 on Fyrakk after 10-11 pulls.
[2:53:18] Gaz_Games_: the skull on the instance icon in normal annoys me :(

[2:56:11] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @KelticNight I was good with that too, but now they talk about the sword because TWW, so it's not fun anymore
[2:56:14] Lithirrdys: Sadge good memes become corporate sellouts
[2:56:28] stljay73: @KelticNight It was funny when Ion wore the shirt at Blizzcon
[2:56:28] StarShopping95: @Edelritter_ just say the game isn't for you. WoW is literally built up on it's PvE content

[2:58:06] Wodiin: I mean there is a easy solution to that. Just sell them off KEKW
[2:58:06] Edelritter_: @Edelritter_ It definitely isnt for me after going back for Dragonflight release and the game being as hollow as ever.
[2:58:08] AlvatoreDimarco: The jarring blips and bloops are from an addon? Oh lordy.
[2:58:12] dinke93: Mike - "I won't get the leggo, don't worry about it." -> Gets it.

[3:00:01] Mazkon: God damn pumpers in there
[3:00:34] stljay73: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Ironically DF is my 3rd favorite, but WoLK and Legion are my bottom 2
[3:00:37] Daxxius: It's jarring how much I noticed the lack of combat music
[3:00:38] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @YuushaEX I've been using those interchangeably since I've been working at a kitchen, because customers use it interchangeable when they bitch, sorry
[3:00:40] metavahn231: u even raid mythic bro?
[3:00:55] lookitsgordo: might have a few people out gearing the normal raid

[3:02:07] Fingle1: think danny/kenny has done every week hc and hasnt got it

[3:31:43] Exaality: all new zones probably
[3:31:45] lookitsgordo: it feels pretty wrapped up. I doubt they cut anything, nevermind a whole major patch.
[3:31:47] shinra40: ppl had higher expectations since the dragon isles should been a big thing
[3:31:49] Azikielboi: @Nobbel87 i feel like thats kind of a fakeout, like they set an expectation that its all about doing stuff for each dragon flight, and then the murazond stuff was all a jebait, which idk i think is cool
[3:31:49] str4ysheep: dream zone
[3:31:50] beskarsilver: KEKW

[3:32:19] Nobbel87: *shrug* we'll never know the inner workings of the kitchen, but the pace/story feels off regardless if it was cut or planned. Both is not great
[3:32:20] GoobleGamingTV: Not seen the vod but how was your BG3 ending experience @preachlfw
[3:32:40] Azikielboi: @Nobbel87 i mean the moment to moment writing definitely isnt enjoyable either way for sure
[3:32:40] nohomu67: Genocide YEP

[3:32:54] yeahs1: You got NVidia now?? Traitor!
[3:32:55] Hjolt: i mean was it not though
[3:32:58] chivmuffin: That ending wasn't in the game originally iirc
[3:33:00] palecarnage: kinda was
[3:33:02] max1461: Genocide was the journey, not the ending
[3:33:05] Narsis6: well, it was, but then you reloaded
[3:33:08] jakeyplops: genocide was in the video tho so must have happened
[3:33:10] Lctl10: 7007 vampires disagree
[3:33:13] metaphased: eeeeks spoilers :( i only came back now u've finished it

[3:33:39] brotdassbernd: its okay, its magic
[3:33:43] Lythi: prolly launched some poor fucked to the other side of the world. we¬¥ll run into some deer hanging in a tree on an island in TWW
[3:33:43] lookitsgordo: @nobbel87 the pacing definitely feels off. I kind of chalk it up to poor storytelling rather than missing content, though. I hope they put some focus on that going forward.
[3:33:46] interztellar: Out of the water actually Nerdge
[3:33:49] Traion: Vinestra28 we got a new one this morning
[3:33:58] Vinestra28: @Traion aye hence me asking NODDERS
[3:34:01] OmegaSyntaX: Nope

[3:34:06] daris888: nope
[3:34:07] Herpdederp117: Fuck all
[3:34:08] FoxonSilverfur: Why would they?
[3:34:08] Dernsby: Nah mostly the same wq's
[3:34:10] rohdey: just more world quests
[3:34:10] chivmuffin: It's just a nice chill WQ
[3:34:11] NeeK_23: world quests
[3:34:12] raxus502: they fixed it where it kinda works right
[3:34:13] Jauffre_: The world quest thing?
[3:34:22] KelticNight: it was broken on launch, did they ever patch it?
[3:34:33] daris888: yay just not many bugs not spawning rocks
[3:34:37] enhanced2: maybe in TWW Copium
[3:34:38] FoxonSilverfur: WoW is held together by potential
[3:34:38] rohdey: @Preachlfw you also missed a quest up by the centaur bridge, theres a shy horny centaur that wants you to rizz up some dryads for him
[3:34:40] raxus502: forbidden reach was the last thing they did with it
[3:34:45] DejavuNeony: @Preachlfw i think the climbing rafts etc will end up being mashed together in the new archeology thing
[3:34:49] Imorteus: that gnoll mentions the toxic boss at the end of brackenhide
[3:34:54] Xann_: You actually just flew away from one of the only hands we get as to the rest of the content in this expansion
[3:35:04] raxus502: "wood"
[3:35:05] nohomu67: monkaW imagine a raid boss with climbing mechanics
[3:35:06] yeahs1: New NElf city. Not on a top of the tree. Inside an expansion zone. Horde can go in. Do I need to elaborate?
[3:35:08] Zimmerh: I honestly think they should do more GW2 jumping puzzles the climbing stuff could have been a integration into these puzzles
[3:35:08] Vinestra28: New words?
[3:35:10] Herpdederp117: @rohdey isn't the centaur a she? been a while
[3:35:11] Lithirrdys: must be a vegan party or something
[3:35:15] KelticNight: was that a Japanese Furbolg?
[3:35:16] Azikielboi: i wonder how much its reusable "tech" vs reusing it would be from scratch essentially
[3:35:18] roseONE: peepoArrive ALOO
[3:35:18] Jarlan23: 10.0 was really cool for open world stuff but they never did anything more after that
[3:35:22] Glenactus: NotLikeThis could of climbed stormwind castle
[3:35:25] Jarlan23: just little events for catch up gear

[3:35:51] Silkwood: Preach when are you doing another 'PUG Series' like in legion? Was a good laugh
[3:36:04] Azikielboi: @Jarlan23 agreed, the events are a lot less cool than the pokemon go + mountain climbing
[3:36:06] Dernsby: The rest of the Amidrassil is actually alright.
[3:36:06] ravenofjudgement: xddTree
[3:36:08] interztellar: Wrathion thing was pretty decent imo

[4:35:24] Fynale: @OmegaSyntaX they seemed to have found a resurgance that's explained in the undead heritage armor questline
[4:35:24] Braggardt: Factions make no sense in this game, how are the Scarlets still around after us wiping them out several times? How are they repopulating?? Who's joining them??

[5:21:05] NecroBeard: Shes got plot power.....
[5:21:06] Braggardt: He's sure supposed to be
[5:21:07] skydoom: she has aspect power doesnt she
[5:21:07] Azikielboi: she is aspect ++ @Preachlfw
[5:21:07] Tetra85: this is way better than gilneas
[5:21:07] Vinestra28: Shes on par with the aspects
[5:21:08] xIGBClutchIx: Odyn just got froze like that
[5:21:09] phinci: CC maybe, no damage, just freeze
[5:21:09] redroniksre: She got stronger cause of Azeroth power
[5:21:09] Marach: shes an aspect now
[5:21:09] Colddaylight: She's and Aspect.. Azeroth's Aspect
[5:21:09] holiweird: she is an aspect here no?
[5:21:10] Entropy_NZ: She's an aspect; she's pretty fuckign strong
[5:21:10] MeowgicTheCathering: frost mages lost deep freeze for her to do that Sadge
[5:21:10] scumlucki: she just froze  him
[5:21:10] Ractorious: or maybe you're just too weak KEKW
[5:21:11] Txn_Nerothos: keeper aren't that strong
[5:21:11] 2maron: nah odyn is expansions behind
[5:21:12] Azikielboi: no thats normal
[5:21:12] nohomu67: Shruge Yeah but storytelling
[5:21:12] Zabraxa: Apperantly not
[5:21:12] Zirconix: he's from two expacs ago, she outlevels him
[5:21:13] raxus502: she is a modern woman, she is unstoppable
[5:21:13] MysticalOS: she was strong before, but she even got blessed as an aspect
[5:21:13] BigMightyena: Chad? More like a chump KEKW
[5:21:13] anaksana: she did just get empowered by the planet
[5:21:15] pyromoto: they are really rushing to war within
[5:21:16] KaisenSiru: His beard will melt the ice
[5:21:17] Ziktus: That was a rather anticlimatic confrontation with Odyn lol
[5:21:18] Deatheran: @Preachlfw but odyn's level like 30 she is 73
[5:21:18] elderratt: she is a primal dragon
[5:21:18] shinra40: a keeper should be stronger
[5:21:18] Azikielboi: no its after
[5:21:20] Knonme21: what power levels KEKW
[5:21:20] Markreivi: Shruge Japan
[5:21:20] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw she rivals the aspects and they're on par with odyn
[5:21:21] dknamey: dragons> keepers
[5:21:22] Taibe: She is same as Fyrakk and Fyrakk is harder boss than Odyn
[5:21:24] roseONE: the strongest would be rat
[5:21:24] sooziecuzie: she's from a later expansion so she's a higher level
[5:21:25] bakingbad: this was just so fucking bad idk man
[5:21:25] zastin586: I guess Odyn got no frost ressistance
[5:21:26] steelfurspeaks: Both her brothers are raid bosses in DF, Odyn is a Raid Boss in Legion. That means she's quite stronger
[5:21:27] trashedskeletor: it is before aspect power
[5:21:28] Azikielboi: she is aspect AND an incarnate
[5:21:29] Dreadzol: no this is after i am pretty sure
[5:21:30] BernardoRel: she's a woman so that makes her automatically strongest
[5:21:31] Litterboxxx: I think Odyn was just blindsided
[5:21:33] Axestro: this questline is recent.
[5:21:39] Skoragon: Like in 40k: The power levels are what they need to be for this particular part of this particular story
[5:21:42] Azikielboi: @trashedskeletor ?
[5:21:42] Goregie: Shes level 70 odyn is only 60
[5:21:43] Dragonnan_Drakelos: She isn't an aspect at this moment of the story. But she is on aspect relative level, being a primal fucking incarnate.
[5:21:47] elderratt: mount
[5:21:47] Phabey: WoW power levels for lore NPCs are always 'whatever the writers want them to be right now', it's a bit silly
[5:21:47] bakingbad: this quest just completely shat on legion
[5:21:48] Dernsby: Got another dragon mount
[5:21:49] sartrik: INVENTORY
[5:21:56] Arthars: Arthars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! ALOO
[5:21:58] turtleandfish: @sooziecuzie that means the ook ook boss from stormstout brewery is more powerful than Kael'thas Sunstrider KEKW
[5:21:58] Azikielboi: @Dragonnan_Drakelos isnt this postraid?
[5:22:03] crazedking45: She is an incarnet which means she was already as powerful as an aspect. Now post Fyrak she is doubly so
[5:22:06] Geri_0123: wasn't this mount trading post as well?
[5:22:06] MysticalOS: "thank you for helping us free the draogn slaves, here is another slave dragon for you to own as a mount"
[5:22:10] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Nope, it's preraid sidequest
[5:22:11] Dernsby: All the dragon riding mouns.
[5:22:17] TheWookiemanSol: incarnates are pretty much on par to the power of the aspects
[5:22:19] Fynale: @Preachlfw so vyranoth was alexstrasza's equal BEFORE she became an aspect so she's probably on scale with a titan keeper
[5:22:19] Vinestra28: @Azikielboi its before post raid however she is also still empowered
[5:22:21] realnzall: @Preachlfw Just read a story of a Wild Magic Sorcerer in BG3 who cast Mage Armor right after leaving the pod. His Wild Magic summoned a Mephit that killed him before he even left the first room
[5:22:25] Streamlabs: üê≤ Check out our new Dragonflight merch in metal band live tour style! https://preachgaming.com/shop/ üê≤
[5:22:28] daris888: this is before raid quest
[5:22:33] nohomu67: KEKYou
[5:22:33] elderratt: @Preachlfw how was the quest?
[5:22:47] adrianialo: If she's so powerful she could've just solo'd it.
[5:22:57] cerolith: she also got a large power boost from becoming an aspect
[5:22:58] Entropy_NZ: she'll be at the same as Fyrrak and Razageth, at least
[5:22:58] Mellowshrimp: well. i guess she's on a level with Razzy and Fyrakk
[5:23:01] Drunkndragon: how does the hero of azeroth compare to any of the npcs in wow
[5:23:02] nohomu67: modCheck
[5:23:02] ECon8990: flightpath nearest the raid
[5:23:02] anaksana: pgeBlind
[5:23:05] reapz2156: Shruge
[5:23:05] xIGBClutchIx: I would assume they will in war wind
[5:23:06] Torkelnder: nearest flypoint to the raid entrance
[5:23:07] Fynale: @Preachlfw she fights alex multiple times in the book
[5:23:07] Prycey: @Preachlfw tier vendor is before the raid near the flightpath
[5:23:09] NeeK_23: near the flight point
[5:23:09] redroniksre: They need to tell it so you can't straight up miss parts
[5:23:10] LuiBMHunter: near the fp
[5:23:10] DrQuackzalver: it's on the hill behind you
[5:23:16] anaksana: its near the flight path close to the raid
[5:23:19] tappyhdw: Closest flight path
[5:23:21] turtleandfish: but it does seem that vyranoth does not like keepers, she might do the ol switcheroo
[5:23:21] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Preachlfw In the game, the power hasn't been shown, only told. The 5 apsects warred with the 4 incarnates and they were equally matched more or less.
[5:23:34] holiweird: @Preachlfw is the war your current main?
[5:23:37] Syrjyys: @Preachlfw Funny/Sad tale about that ToGC unhittable tank... we had warr with the gear but he worked for Dutch army and went to Afganistan just before we reached Anub.  600 pulls and 0 kills later ICC was released
[5:23:44] LuiBMHunter: turn left
[5:23:45] zastin586: 1 platform up
[5:23:45] NeeK_23: right of the building
[5:23:45] def_glitch: Aspects are below keepers, because a keeper elevated them to Aspects
[5:23:46] Axestro: @Preachlfw the story is more gradual and easier to follow if you do it when it comes out and not all in one go like this.
[5:23:46] Tossberg: Go Annihilator first off
[5:23:47] elderratt: @Fynale shouldnt be in a book
[5:23:47] LuiBMHunter: turn right now
[5:23:51] LuiBMHunter: over there ---------->
[5:23:52] anaksana: other side of the builkding
[5:23:56] Yurian33: so blind
[5:23:57] GoTeamAJ: GoTeamAJ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Been watching some old "Legacy of the" videos. Still waiting for the Shaman one lol. Glad to see ya back on WoW.
[5:24:24] Fynale: @elderratt it was a fight scene. like literally in game alexstrasza is like "we can't take them without our aspectral powers" so it's not a far stretch
[5:24:25] PvtHudson093: dont mis it up with PVP tier
[5:24:33] LuiBMHunter: you've got lots of catalyst charges saved up btw
[5:24:41] flynxJR: well you cant compare classic to vanilla
[5:24:45] flynxJR: its not the same game
[5:24:59] KaisenSiru: Cata Pog
[5:25:00] Khalus90: yeh AOTC used to mean shit
[5:25:00] Phabey: @flynxJR people do conflate them though
[5:25:02] Dernsby: Unnerfed heroic dungeons hopefully.
[5:25:04] Markreivi: 90% of the players had 10 fps in Ironforge alone KEKW
[5:25:06] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @elderratt OHHH, I forgot about the Alexstrasza vs Raszageth cutscene.
[5:25:06] Azikielboi: harder in my day xdd
[5:25:06] GoTeamAJ: Oh 100% haha
[5:25:08] TeslaCoilTV: heroics wont be hard
[5:25:10] chavelo_: people gonna complain about hard dungeons again
[5:25:12] redroniksre: Oh it will be obliterated too
[5:25:13] Shintek: cata classic Bedge
[5:25:16] raxus502: cant wait for spine to kill classic
[5:25:20] Tetra85: the healing was so hard at the start of cata
[5:25:21] Azikielboi: congratz on your clear it was harder in 2011 xdd
[5:25:25] Ronny_Styles: Are you planning to do a Legacy Of Cata before its release?
[5:25:26] HaipexTV: progging new content is not the same as the guys who have been playing private servers for years speedrunning the game
[5:25:31] TheFuriyon: yea no Uber bugged mid fight changes on Sinestra @preachlfw

[5:26:15] SharakUK: me and my clique have played classic up to killing lich king and its a blast, but rather than play cata we're coming back to retail
[5:26:15] Dragonnan_Drakelos: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Yeah, but Vyranoth is more powerful (probably), Raszageth is also the youngest
[5:26:17] Entropy_NZ: We raided 10. So hard
[5:26:18] KaisenSiru: Druids Pog
[5:26:21] Azikielboi: Pog kitties

[5:27:17] GoTeamAJ: Still never going to have that seeing Sindragrosa for the first titme feeling ever again though.
[5:27:19] Skipitin: Btw have you seen the new video about the Emperor from Luetin?
[5:27:19] DasFlume: Cata was the expansion that made me quit the first time
[5:27:21] Vinestra28: @Dragonnan_Drakelos Razzy was their weakest and barely made the cut Shruge
[5:27:24] cinnatoasto_: What happened to the guild Paragon? I thought they were still going
[5:27:33] Geri_0123: will the sonar dragon release in a fixed state? KEKW

[5:28:03] Vinestra28: @Dragonnan_Drakelos ahhh
[5:28:04] Skipitin: I was visiting my cousin when Cata released. He couldn't stay logged in more than 15 minutes first two days.
[5:28:07] brastilou: cuties only AYAYA
[5:28:08] MysticalOS: outside of tuning issues, i still think first tier cataclysm was great. the dungeons were fun pre nerf. if classic executes right it can be cata without all the issues
[5:28:10] Molkohr: @Preachlfw a historic look at ragnaros HC as (subjectively) the start of "modern raiding" would be cool to see! interview people like Fraggo who were there at the time?
[5:28:11] huntaoce: atramedes PepeLaugh
[5:28:12] KaisenSiru: Ah yes Atramedes
[5:28:16] GoTeamAJ: Hopefully with WWN or Midnight we get to see a secrete boss phase.

[5:30:03] HypnoHorror: Amazing how bad Blizzard was at this time
[5:30:10] GoTeamAJ: If we could have the story/settings of the old raids with the mechanics of the newer raids we're be set imo. The newer raids feel flashy but I lose the reason for being in there.
[5:30:13] Ractorious: not patching an exploit in a week, that's not very blizzard
[5:30:15] Tetra85: I hated that worm
[5:30:15] Axestro: Not the same situation, but it kind of reminds me of Kurog mythic. Everyone doing some shit that was not intended at all.

[5:32:46] OhMyGodItsChloe: 10man every encounter was so fucked
[5:32:51] KaisenSiru: Conclave of Wind Pog
[5:32:54] Charm_pit: was warr fun in Cata? what was the most fun to play?
[5:33:04] Elistine: We did it back in day. halfus wasnt fun lol
[5:33:07] erasar: man, I'm glad I've only raided chill Mythic, avoided all the release bugs :D
[5:33:10] Shintek: what is blizzards excuse for continued release of incredibly unbalanced/ broken raid bosses?
[5:33:11] bigoldmeatpie: @Deatheran nope it's dumb but zygor is "legit". the addon is free but the guides cost money so it's technically within TOS
[5:33:14] thereuz8: @Preachlfw someone i play with now was your co-tank when you played in Cata. his name in game was Retalius
[5:33:17] Syrjyys: Conclave 25man... ffs wind platform

[5:33:48] Balaur1135: @Shintek Push the top teams, nerf, then nerf more until certain other teams clear. They don't test their own content.
[5:33:53] Geri_0123: seeing all those adds on the screen just want me to press combustion and inferno blast
[5:33:53] Deatheran: @HypnoHorror or when they purposly left demo locks undertuned and broken cause they didint want people playing it when it was getting a rework later on
