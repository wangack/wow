[0:05:04] teachzin: Good morning @Minpojke <3
[0:09:49] gotemg1: this priest was in shinta's chat asking where are u and now u face them first game xD COINCIDENCE
[0:09:50] Moobot: www.Twitter.com/Minpojke_ & https://www.instagram.com/jonandersson92/ and https://discord.gg/STTWtwwDet
[0:10:13] Xeriyo: shinta's positivity is infectious
[0:10:41] fingerboy___: seems kinda hard to gain rating atm since no teams are playing on the same mmr, gotta win like 20 games in a row to gain 50 rating above 3.1-3150
[0:10:58] gotemg1: @fingerboy___  SOD Phase 2
[0:11:12] Phicon_: @fingerboy___ Ye same in 3s
[0:11:43] fingerboy___: Honestly I think that its better to que at this hour then to que later, as every game right now is kinda "free".... but yes of course shit can happen and u can drop 1 game and -25
[0:12:06] notmorbos: or you face that stupid rdruid warr 3 times in a row and lose all your rating :)
[0:12:31] fingerboy___: @notmorbos dw we will lose to your random bites that does 12k
[0:13:06] notmorbos: do other feral priests win you? it feels super hard but also i think im playing it far from optimal
[0:13:19] fingerboy___: ye i mean for your rating right now you are prob right i agree with that, but if you were like 3.2-3.1 then it would be better to que now against 3k teams ish i think
[0:13:58] Phicon_: Bro best comp is SPM xD
[0:14:03] Biggypanda: do people still play double rouge
[0:14:05] Phicon_: This shit is unreal idk

[0:14:12] fingerboy___: @notmorbos ask Pojke
[0:14:22] notmorbos: oh talking to fingerboy, sorry :D
[0:14:54] fingerboy___: I mean it is like 60/40 for us I think, maybe 50/50 or even 40/60 vs good teams.
[0:15:15] notmorbos: ok i figured smth like that. we really gotta work on that MU
[0:15:25] fingerboy___: In general we are favoured cause most ferals doesn't really know what to do or discs as well I guess. (No flame), but theres a huge difference facing Spott+Simba and any other Feral on the ladder.
[0:16:10] notmorbos: well its a bit of a problem of matchup inexperience. i only good kinda decent recently and theres like 2 warr druids out there
[0:16:11] Moobot: playlist !socialmedias !photosynthesis !covenant !legendaries !conduits !stats !discord !macros !ui !specs !restodruid !awc !armory
[0:16:12] fingerboy___: Ye well if we put it like that then the matchup is 0/100
[0:16:22] notmorbos: simbo has played it thousands of times probably
[0:16:39] notmorbos: well we cba and push
[0:16:49] notmorbos: i get cept into triple cyclone twice and my priest is dead
[0:16:53] notmorbos: as i said, gotta work on that :D
[0:17:23] fingerboy___: @Minpojke we fought against a warrpal on Horde that was better than Qwneer+Azmo/whatever pala
[0:17:46] fingerboy___: just a random team on the ladder being 3-3.1 xD
[0:17:50] fingerboy___: playing safe
[0:18:07] Fiftyswen: @fingerboy___ wait till we switch to human....copium
[0:18:27] fingerboy___: We won like once or twice, (mby).. but dont even remember it, but some games are close cause Qwneer plays aggro and I mean he doesnt give a damn u know.
[0:18:37] notmorbos: my priest is not here rn so not yet i guess
[0:18:41] twitchfulgladiator2024: i mean its monday 13;00 nobody with a life would be qing rn
[0:18:46] notmorbos: (hoping he doesnt show up with the other feral again Prayge )
[0:19:03] fingerboy___: So he pushes towards Dverik overextends a lil bit maybe and then we get clone and blablba backfires.. but yea at the end they still have bop/freedom/etc etc defensively so technically warrpal can never dies vs us if played defensively as the warrpala on horde did.l
[0:19:17] Vessler: @twitchfulgladiator2024 lowkey flaming pojke, I support it
[0:19:30] fingerboy___: @Fiftyswen think it will be easier then for us.
[0:19:41] Fiftyswen: @fingerboy___ actually might be true
[0:20:00] Fiftyswen: but honestly we have 0 clue of the matchup and feel like we lack the dmg to kill druide....so we play it save
[0:20:13] fingerboy___: exactly what i was going to write and deleted my message that was about to send.
[0:20:32] fingerboy___: but playing it safe will not score a win next game you face us, cuz i will just play like you do
[0:20:37] fingerboy___: 47 min draw
[0:20:45] Xeriyo: what comp vs waht @fingerboy___
[0:20:59] Fiftyswen: that was the first long game though....every game before we won below 20 mins
[0:21:19] notmorbos: so everything below 20 min is not a long game? KEKW
[0:21:25] notmorbos: im glad i dont play warrior i guess
[0:21:37] Fiftyswen: in a war vs war matchup for sure
[0:21:42] gotemg1: sac'd 2 CC's
[0:21:44] gotemg1: yikes
[0:21:56] Xeriyo: young heckfy
[0:22:28] Fiftyswen: i mean its our first season together, my first season playing serious 2s at all and we play horde....ofc we have a lot of room to improve
