[0:34:05] Cara1977: @shelana95 Cool!
[0:34:08] Decadence001: @Preachlfw i've had to do CPR in many strange places and for prolonged periods of time. Techniques certainly needs to be good to prevent tiring... once you start you can't stop
[0:34:14] Markreivi: BoomerDisco btw
[0:34:31] Shelana95: @Cara1977 Sounds cooler than it is ;) but its something
[0:34:44] ployboi69: Sure Kappa
[0:34:46] chavelo_: better break rips then die
[0:34:50] JakeZGR: @Preachlfw you can't do it too hard
[0:34:50] Umseslad: Can't really do it to hard
[0:34:50] ErgarX: it's often normal to break some rips
[0:34:51] chavelo_: ribs*
[0:34:51] NeeK_23: crushing ribs
[0:34:51] joelster73: Not a problem on adults
[0:34:53] Elrick_James: CPR usually breaks some ribs
[0:34:55] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw if you aint breaking ribs youre not doing it right
[0:34:57] Wodiin: If you arent cracking ribs you are doing it wrong
[0:34:58] Markreivi: Testosterone is a weird drug honestly.
[0:35:00] FILLAN88: You'd have to hurt the heart, ribs/ribcage will get wrecked, better than dying
[0:35:01] Seyna: if u dont break ribs you prob arent doing it right
[0:35:02] joelster73: On kids or babies it's slightly worse
[0:35:02] Decadence001: Nah, no such thing - the casualty is dead already, what could be worse? @Preachlfw
[0:35:07] Phabey: ribs normally break if done properly right
[0:35:09] bigmeanbeefy: If you break a rib, thats not an issue, remmember, the person is dead so anything else can be better
[0:35:09] OmegaSyntaX: living > broken ribs
[0:35:10] Markreivi: DED
[0:35:13] majkos: as long as you dont piledrive them it should be ok
[0:35:14] sinclsw23: they'r dying anyway
[0:35:18] Umseslad: If you don't do it they die
[0:35:19] Marach: You will break ribs doing cpr
[0:35:20] ployboi69: HUHH
[0:35:21] Zziggz: The nurses cracked 3 ribs when they did cpr on my mum
[0:35:22] Zyrakel: lmao
[0:35:24] JakeZGR: @Preachlfw when we are doing CPR they are already dead, so you cannot do any more harm
[0:35:25] oxoKumakichioxo: broken ribs or death by choke
[0:35:25] Cara1977: Probably
[0:35:26] Bendix10: Easy now cowboy
[0:35:28] Markreivi: NODDERS
[0:35:29] cruzo: blood for the blood gods
[0:35:29] bagwaa: euthenasia
[0:35:33] Shelana95: True
[0:35:34] Decadence001: THIS IS TRUE!!!
[0:35:36] Xythana: even emergency workers break ribs sometimes
[0:35:37] GeordieMarauder: realist though
[0:35:37] Byteflux: Shruge
[0:35:39] Thornefield: Better some broken ribs than dead
[0:35:40] Braggardt: fuck i was literally writing that Despairge
[0:35:40] sinclsw23: you have to try you mf-er
[0:35:40] chavelo_: i mean its true, better broken ribs then die
[0:35:43] Markreivi: AAAA CRUSH
[0:35:47] nessardo: if somebody needs CPR then broken ribs are nothing
[0:35:48] Wodiin: I mean he aint wrong
[0:35:48] bigmeanbeefy: Thats not cold hearted at all, you cant really go lower than being dead, breaking ribs is not an issue
[0:35:49] Reiyayru: @JakeZGR peepoGoosehug
[0:35:51] majkos: you cant cpr on a women in 2024 anyway :D
[0:35:54] Shelana95: A child you use alittle less force
[0:35:54] JakeZGR: Reiyayru mopHug
[0:35:54] PlutoInsanity: child uses 1 hand. baby uses 2 fingers
[0:35:55] Decadence001: @Preachlfw the only difference in CPR techniques is for kids and babies
[0:35:56] juriell86: actually the docs say the same thing
[0:35:56] Dernsby: It's either break ribs or they risk dying
[0:35:59] Thornefield: It frequently will break ribs.
[0:35:59] joelster73: You use want hand on a child
[0:35:59] Wodiin: The alternative is death.
[0:36:01] chavelo_: children almost always break the ribs with cpr
[0:36:01] ployboi69: LUL
[0:36:02] shrimpssy: i think u aim for 3 cm deep
[0:36:03] Shelana95: but you still break their ribbs
[0:36:06] Traion: Medicine is all about risk vs. reward. If they die without CPR literally nothing you could do can make it worse
[0:36:07] Aknikai: in germany its illegal to not do it, "killing" the wounded is a possible, protected outcome
[0:36:10] rat4larry: what is better, breaking some ribs or death
[0:36:12] XamiRozar: Then less resistance to get that heart going
[0:36:18] taranathome: It is better to have a broken rib but be alive
[0:36:18] Marach: A broken rib is better tbh
[0:36:19] ployboi69: Then Healer adjust Kappa
[0:36:21] Markreivi: Well for kids you don't use your whole weight or full hand.
[0:36:21] XamiRozar: get past the ribs faster
[0:36:21] joelster73: St John's do a great CPR intro course
[0:36:21] captainuselessv2: captainuselessv2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hi Mike, random tree on this forest here, I see you're still not level 40. poor
[0:36:22] Muggus: i think its kids 1 use 1 hand and a baby is 2 fingers
[0:36:22] bagwaa: if you kill someone whilst doing CPR is that still murder or manslaughter if the intension was to keep them alive?
[0:36:23] sinclsw23: you now how to vary your force don't you?
[0:36:24] Muggus: been a while tho
[0:36:25] Methuzahla: WHAT
[0:36:29] Decadence001: 1 hand for kids <12, fingers for babies @Preachlfw also difrerent rates
[0:36:30] cruzo: lol
[0:36:30] Cara1977: U have my permission to break my ribs if saving my life. I'll sign a waver
[0:36:33] leinadnoss: Just trust me bro wtf?
[0:36:34] Vinestra28: For small kids? babies? its two fingers
[0:36:38] Phabey: when my dad passed, the dr explicitly said to us 'if we need to try cpr, we will break so many ribs and it won't be pleasant'
[0:36:39] juriell86: left ear only
[0:36:40] Methuzahla: John gon fuck you up now NODDERS

[0:36:56] Wodiin: Dont finger the babies
[0:36:58] Sockerbagaren: 12 fingers? I don't have that many HUHH

[0:37:10] Unrealsiege: full power always

[0:37:14] Byteflux: peepoFAT
[0:37:15] anjilo: wave a pie under their nose instead

[0:39:03] majkos: and the biker didnt even need cpr, mike just went for it
[0:39:09] Decadence001: @Preachlfw Actually, a 'pre-cordial thump' - or a punch in the chest - is used in witnessed cardiac arrest with certain rhythms. Can actually restore normal rhythm with a punch - i've done it once or twice!
[0:39:11] joelster73: You can get patches for mouth to mouth
[0:39:11] Markreivi: That's a fetish for somebody.
[0:39:11] eximisprime: just make sure you dress as one of the avengers when you give someone CPR...
[0:39:13] elderratt: can i cpr a hot guy?

[0:39:45] SpiderXIV: pre-cordial thump is what I'm naming my new band
[0:39:49] Decadence001: @suzaku70 yes, masks with one way valves
[0:39:50] LoneSurvivorOfUs: @Preachlfw people in the US have actually tried to sue people for performing CPR
[0:39:54] Gaotastic: elbow drops for the heimlich instead
[0:39:56] Synckery: only mouth to mouth, you didnt pump him
[0:39:59] Synckery: got it
[0:40:00] bagwaa: like a double team?
[0:40:01] rat4larry: u got manhandled
[0:40:03] DukePiewalker: I carry one of those blanket mouthpiece thingies for mouth to mouth in one of the card holder slots of my phone case.

[0:40:30] Decadence001: no, it's never good - it's the smell of death
[0:40:32] suzaku70: @suzaku70 Thanks
[0:40:33] MunkeyNZ: OSFrog OSFrog
[0:40:33] Shelana95: @Preachlfw Funfact. they have started to teach that the breath is not needed, cause alot of people are hessitant to do CPR cause of it. So they have started to say that chest compressions is better than nothing
[0:40:33] Lionheartex: SNIFFA
[0:40:34] grumpy_dan: technically it was your breath that came out of him
[0:40:37] Markreivi: Good guy
[0:40:40] elderratt: a cave in ff12
[0:40:45] nohomu67: NODDERS And question your sexuality

[0:41:07] Traion: Mouth to Nose is also an option

[0:41:14] ployboi69: What if you get sued? Kappa
[0:41:15] smartm07: mouth2mouth > ass2 ass
[0:41:15] cruzo: @preachlfw you are protected under “Good Samaritan law” if you have your updated cpr document . you can’t be sued
[0:41:16] Decadence001: @Preachlfw it's not hesitancy - it's poor technique that doesn't really make much difference. Chest compressions are the only thing that actually have been proven to make a differencew
[0:41:17] JohnnyMcCrit: so, I saved your life, but I may be gay now KappaHD
[0:41:19] rat4larry: i would be afrain in NA
[0:41:19] elderratt: i will only mouth to mouth a hot guy eww woman
[0:41:19] Xythana: people have been sued for it yeah
[0:41:20] Lionheartex: There are some guys who won't wash their ass because they think it's gay so yeah I can believe that
[0:41:20] Shelana95: Respect the woman's boundrys
[0:41:30] bigmeanbeefy: Its also proven that the chest compressions, does more than breathing in air, so its only needed for 1 exhale into the lungs and then go back to compressions
[0:41:31] ErgarX: yes
[0:41:32] Syrjyys: Yes
[0:41:35] Markreivi: Yeah
[0:41:36] Phabey: @Lionheartex KEKW
[0:41:37] Decadence001: @Preachlfw for the general public yes
[0:41:38] realnzall: @Preachlfw Morning Mike! Apparently Cybertrucks are rusting because even though their body is made of stainless steel, that can definitely rust in the right conditions
[0:41:38] Lithirrdys: yeah, you kissed the dude for nothing
[0:41:40] Vinestra28: @Preachlfw If theyre still breathing its not an issue
[0:41:46] Philbobaggins12: @Preachlfw I'm sure if a woman had a family and you gave her CPR when nobody else would they'd be very grateful
[0:41:47] rat4larry: OMEGALUL
[0:41:47] PlutoInsanity: What about if the person unknowing has a DNR?
[0:41:48] Umseslad: For once we're not
[0:41:51] bagwaa: Yes, it's just classed as "getting off with sick people" now
[0:41:51] Markreivi: CPR doesn't require mouth-to-mouth currentlyh.
[0:41:54] Akenys: But if you like it Gayge
[0:41:56] melturto: They're starting to develop CPR dummies with breasts to increase a women's likelhood of receiving CPR

[0:42:09] ployboi69: LUL
[0:42:10] joelster73: Otherwise you'll burst their longs
[0:42:10] Geri_0123: the current recommendaon is just chest compressions
[0:42:11] rat4larry: lmaoo
[0:42:13] majkos: @LoneSurvivorOfUs that spread, I think there was a notable drop of man willing to cpr on a woman because of lawsuits
[0:42:19] chavelo_: @PlutoInsanity dont think a DNR is valid outside of the hospital
[0:42:19] alwiro: blow em up like a balloon till they pop
[0:42:22] Lionheartex: half way to necrophilia monkaS
[0:42:22] suzaku70: Its also to make sure it goes to lungs and not stomach
[0:42:23] theaveragetoast: mouth to mouth is preferable, but not necessary
[0:42:29] Methuzahla: NODDERS
[0:42:32] Vinestra28: Same in Sydney
[0:42:35] ployboi69: KEKW
[0:42:35] Markreivi: @Preachlfw They're for heart arrythmia.
[0:42:39] Xaarca: mouth to mouth does nothing unless you do it a specific way. do it wrong and air isnt actually going to the lungs
[0:42:39] sinclsw23: there's one in our town centre
[0:42:42] joelster73: AEDs tell you how to use them
[0:42:42] WackoLlama: They're automatic, you don't need training for them
[0:42:43] Decadence001: @Preachlfw The CO2 content in expired air makes it much less efficient. It's much better to concentrate on non-interrupted compressions and wait until a formal airway can be established by someone trained.
[0:42:43] Geri_0123: also when I learned it it was mouth-to-nose
[0:42:43] crashuloxd: Same here
[0:42:44] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: They retrofitted a lot of phone booths right;
[0:42:46] Vinestra28: Sydney has em at major bus stops
[0:42:55] PlutoInsanity: whn I was in secondary school, I campaigned my school to get defibs.
[0:42:57] Markreivi: Hmm
[0:43:01] Lionheartex: Do you sound demonic when you snore?
[0:43:02] nessardo: it's not for EMT people it's for anyone to use in case of emergency
[0:43:04] AltCoby: @Preachlfw In Denmark we have "heart runners" who access those wall mounted defibs
[0:43:05] Tartuccio: LIGMA monkaS
[0:43:05] Lithirrdys: the state of our ambulence services these days, you better hope the public know how to use those
[0:43:05] bigmeanbeefy: Here in norway, malls sports centers and other places people gather usually have heart starters, not so much on the street
[0:43:12] Wodiin: You can rent tests from chemist for sleep apena stuff.
[0:43:16] bagwaa: in Nottingham there is a defribulator outside the undertakers office, seems a bit late
[0:43:19] nessardo: and it actually guides you with voice on what you need to do
[0:43:20] alwiro: gotta ask your wife if you stop breathing :D
[0:43:24] RockyReee: we have so many people in our area stealing the defibulators, madness
[0:43:26] DukePiewalker: Theyre usually in the entrances of big businesses or schools/workplaces here in Sweden. There's an app for it too.
[0:43:30] Mr__Flibble_: Have you ever woken up dead? That's one way to tell
[0:43:32] nohomu67: POOGERS ME TOO
[0:43:32] Decadence001: @Preachlfw apologies, but my PhD involved cardiac arrest algorithms :P I spend most time teaching kids CPR now
[0:43:32] smartm07: we know
[0:43:33] Reiyayru: I have very bad sleep apena
[0:43:33] zeppo3K: do it for stream content

[0:43:51] MrZxorm: I did that once. Nearly died. Good times
[0:43:52] Lionheartex: @Preachlfw I did that and found out my heart was dire so I wouldn't recommend it
[0:43:53] Traion: If you snore and have bad sleep testing for sleep apnea is a good idea. Sleep affects everything
[0:43:54] Kirah__: im fine until proven otherwise
[0:43:54] rat4larry: next thing u know u have to sleep with a whole mouthguard connected to a machine thing
[0:43:58] LoneSurvivorOfUs: @Preachlfw then you either cant get an appointment because an elderly person has a sniffle or they say to take paracetamol

[0:44:08] mobbeh: one eye test on stream or what PauseChamp
[0:44:10] majkos: Amen brother, we die at 50 like a real man !
[0:44:10] DzikiWegorz1223: @Atreyu_Lavellan and if stops hurting after 6 months, then it's fine too NODDERS
[0:44:13] crashuloxd: HUHH

[1:13:27] killmatix: druid has windfury
[1:13:31] Tartuccio: feral druids got windfury
[1:13:48] Braggardt: nobody plays enhancement on alliance, it's sad
[1:13:50] Markreivi: Though their dps is worse than other specs as the casters go their full kit.
[1:13:52] Geri_0123: didn't all the druids reroll to moonkin?
[1:14:01] AngryFil: probably a druid
[1:14:04] Tartuccio: PepeLaugh

[1:14:25] pazernus: was busted*
[1:14:28] cruzo: @preachlfw what do you think they will touch in the balance patch on the 20th ?
[1:14:34] Lorriluring: @forevrzero starsurge is still crazy
[1:14:38] snuffles_80: Druid got a nerf recently, starsurge was so op
[1:14:39] pazernus: starsurge damage was nerfed by over 50% overall damage done
[1:14:39] Markreivi: Wait they fixed Starsuge?
[1:15:05] Markreivi: Ohh finally
[1:15:06] pazernus: starsurge barelly hits for more than wrath and hits less than starfire now
[1:15:08] cruzo: yes but now shadow word pain does 1400 damage
[1:15:21] Markreivi: They had to do something about the mana cost, cooldown or damage.
[1:15:31] Markreivi: Good thing about the nerf, somewhat deserved.
[1:15:42] Markreivi: Shadow Word: Death will also require a nerf
[1:15:57] Markreivi: And Lava Burst needs some tuning. I say this as an Ele Shammy.
[1:15:57] pazernus: so does raptor strike

[1:16:21] snuffles_80: Heard melee hunters are freaks right now in pvp
[1:16:28] Markreivi: Aye Raptor Strike was made into a busted shit when they removed the CD
[1:16:34] Philbobaggins12: @Lorriluring No patience, cap in 2 days or slow! :P
[1:16:46] pazernus: melee hunter is like a horror villain in pvp, they  cant catch anyone up but if they do they kill them :P
[1:16:55] cruzo: @snuffles_80  I win vs them but I have to play enhance with rockbiter and earthen to reduce the dmg
[1:16:56] Braggardt: There's a portal to SFK from Stormwind now, should be a nice shortcut!
[1:16:56] OmegaSyntaX: just sneak onto the zepplin NODDERS

[1:21:59] Allessii: they are boe you can buy them
[1:22:03] Markreivi: You can get 2x of the rings from WSG. not that awful to do with the Ashenvale event
[1:22:09] Markreivi: 28lvl & 38lvl ones.
[1:22:15] anjilo: prebis lists are often overkill, just make an effort to keep your gear up to date and don't be shit is more than enough for most content.
[1:22:18] SilverSerpent69: Morrigans Might?
[1:22:32] Markreivi: Bonebiter is a goodun
[1:22:34] KelticNight: chat said Bonebiter was legit yesterday

[1:23:14] bodkinz_: tldr; make your own list
[1:23:15] DukePiewalker: Because its always been worse than bonebiter
[1:23:21] bwhittaker: because its good for horde not worth the effort on alliance
[1:23:22] SilverSerpent69: @Vinestra28 Oh yes absolutely :D
[1:23:22] Philbobaggins12: @Preachlfw Because it's actually shit, you're looking at it through rose tinted goggles
[1:23:34] kaw_kaw: The only reason WW axe is "that good" isw cause you can get boosted into it at level 30
[1:23:40] MagicPants_99: its a lvl 30 weapon
[1:23:49] Vinestra28: lvl 30 its great. at lvl 40.. its ehh
[1:23:49] anjilo: it's good, just not level 40 good.
[1:23:49] Disfideus: due to the speed maybe?

[1:28:40] coral_k_: I think it's all from tokens anyway
[1:28:45] Tjapneus: there's mail set too
[1:28:46] Braggardt: There is a plate tier set, but I guess the leather is bis
[1:28:48] realnzall: @Preachlfw Apparently Tesla CyberTrucks are rusting because the uncoated stainless steel the panels are made of can't cope with salty sea air
[1:28:49] Decadence001: @dragothicx only eviscerated of it's diseased innards, it remains but a skin currently
[1:28:53] Tjapneus: and plate
[1:28:55] brackers89: When we rezzing fat cat!?
[1:29:10] Heret3k: Bosses drop a lot more items as well this time round, did it for the first time last night and we had several epics + plenty of tokens etc. Will be easier to gear that p1
[1:29:11] dragothicx: I guess I wasn't fully following the subathon then LUL

[1:30:33] huntaoce: Pog
[1:30:38] realnzall: @Preachlfw Unrelated to the stream, but installing my new SSD was fairly painless. I did have to figure out how to close the latch on the screwless M.2 standoff, and getting the thumb screws back in for the GPU bracket was a mess, but I made it work

[1:35:53] Tartuccio: real?
[1:35:55] Markreivi: Get fucked Alliance
[1:36:11] Tartuccio: why SFK and not SM KEKL
[1:36:17] Markreivi: Factual and big
[1:36:22] Lionheartex: SFK is close enough to SM
[1:36:25] Flayswow: Flayswow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:36:26] Lionheartex: that's pretty reasonable
[1:36:26] Tartuccio: fair
[1:36:30] Markreivi: Because SM is Horde Territory SMadge
[1:36:30] Fataldh: Because funny Clueless
[1:36:33] Av3nturA: faster Travels to Shadowfang  By Kaivax <Community Manager> yesterday at 6:07 AM (Patch 10.2.5)
[1:36:35] Markreivi: Smadge
[1:36:41] Tartuccio: though horde just get a straight up teleport to Gnomeregan which is Alliance territory Shruge
[1:36:51] kingt0s: why is SFK relevant??
[1:36:56] chavelo_: @Markreivi So is SFK
[1:37:04] Fataldh: As a fellow copium enjoyer, when are the Ret buffs coming in?
[1:37:07] Av3nturA: love is in the air ?
[1:37:07] Markreivi: Aye, but SFK is irrelevant
[1:37:10] Phabey: horde can't get in to dun morogh without going through Alliance guards, it's not the same
[1:37:16] Lithirrdys: @Tartuccio iirc this existed in vanilla though
[1:37:17] Vinestra28: @Fataldh what needs buffing?
[1:37:23] Tartuccio: @Phabey ah good point
[1:37:23] Braggardt: blizz hates (faction i am currently playing), typical (faction i am not currently playing) favouritism
[1:37:33] Markreivi: I still can gank the stupid Allies as they run through Tirisfal SMOrc
[1:37:37] dragothicx: Classic
[1:37:42] Markreivi: SMASH
[1:37:43] m_azark: Okay so i'm not really a WoW player, if someone can explain why warlocks would be upset at a summon wardrobe?
[1:37:52] Fataldh: @Vinestra28 Damage aint the greatest just yet, feels it's lacking something
[1:38:03] Streamlabs: 🐲 Check out our new Dragonflight merch in metal band live tour style! https://preachgaming.com/shop/ 🐲
[1:38:04] Tartuccio: @m_azark less money I guess
[1:38:06] Zziggz: @m_azark they can make gold by selling summons
[1:38:12] Vinestra28: @m_azark imagine 50 children all begging you at once for it
[1:38:15] Fenzha: @m_azark makes them not only responsible for summoning their own party but other people too
[1:38:15] Lionheartex: @m_azark people will bother them more for summons because it's 100x easier for them to do now
[1:38:22] dragothicx: AAAA music
[1:38:22] Markreivi: @m_azark It makes other classes available to summon folk.
[1:38:24] Vinestra28: @Fataldh Shruge feels pretty good to me.
[1:38:29] Markreivi: @Markreivi No more monopoly
[1:38:36] Impurite: @m_azark because then alt warlocks can drop the temporary summon and log out making taking a lock to things unneeded.
[1:38:44] Markreivi: Headbang
[1:38:44] Lionheartex: You know how people beg mages for ports? it's that but like 1000 times worse for Warlocks
[1:38:45] mfcrocker: cause /tell warlock SUM PLS x10000
[1:38:58] m_azark: okay so from what I've gathered from the responses, the whole summon thing was a Warlock skill and now anyone can do it?
[1:39:01] Markreivi: wideWalk
[1:39:01] Vinestra28: @mfcrocker oi oi. slow in a few more slurs mate
[1:39:06] Tjapneus: thats why always sit afk at SM :)
[1:39:08] mfcrocker: I literally have to go DND when I'm in Desolace
[1:39:09] Fenzha: My warlock cant do 5 minutes without asking for summons
[1:39:10] Tjapneus: as a warlock
[1:39:19] alwiro: fight fight fight
[1:39:19] Lionheartex: @m_azark no no, only Warlocks can do it - just demand FAR FAR FAR exceeds supply
[1:39:20] Tartuccio: @m_azark no Warlocks still have to create the portal itself, but they can just have alts do it
[1:39:21] Markreivi: Yeah, anything that makes summoning easier, makes Warlocks Madge
[1:39:25] Vinestra28: @m_azark NOPERS wrong. It is still a lock thing just you get a lot mor ebegging for t
[1:39:39] m_azark: OHHH OK, that makes sense, thanks for the response chat

[5:57:36] Madelion: The potential of BRD is insane though, with the fire torch room and 10 people you could make it require all 4 at once etc.
