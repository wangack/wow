[2:55:29] SilkeySmooth: gdkps will dominate classic wrath worse then classic tbc
[2:55:35] Broomba: @towelliee -- but i love saying Hi in FF14
[2:55:46] WillWoW: What if: Blizz gives players chance to vote for "skip cataclysm" or "continue expansions line with cataclysm" pre-MOP, that'd be cool @Rexialiton
[2:55:49] cannibalcanyon: mines been sayin the same
[2:55:57] HolyAkiao: Seems like a bug. I got it this morning but it was up to date
[2:55:58] darkdestroz: @Towelliee if u have wowup that can update Elvui
[2:56:18] Shrenko: just join a guild and avoid gdkp
[2:56:20] cerealkillas22: what server are ya on?
[2:56:20] Broomba: @darkkronoz is wowup fixed?
[2:56:37] Broomba: @cerealkillas22 the new fresh pve server
[2:56:45] Rexialiton: @Towelliee Try this https://www.tukui.org/classic-wotlk-addons.php?id=8
[2:57:11] camslam: I dont know what GDKP means and at this point im too afraid to ask
[2:57:11] valth: i so need to find a guild to join on this serverlol
[2:57:20] Alaquane: How much are people going to pay for Val'anyr?
[2:57:46] Broomba: @valth which server?
[2:57:49] Day_Walker78: just get the client from there website to update it with
[2:57:58] cerealkillas22: has there been login queues on Maladath? I rolled on the PvP fresh server
[2:58:10] Broomba: @cerealkillas22 mope
[2:58:12] darkdestroz: @broomba idk if itz fixed, but wowup still supports Elvui and things from wago etc, not curse tho
[2:58:18] Sadisticmedic: We Have Hammer Squad still
[2:58:18] watpuppy: Anyone have a link for a nameplate addon that actually works in beta?
[2:58:23] Rexialiton: @WillWoW I mean. mop classic isnt really a "classic". then they should come up with something new for the specific newer "classic versions"
[2:58:23] Tybow0811: His guild is a banger
[2:58:29] Tybow0811: Definitely recommend
[2:58:31] Shrenko: fuck gdkp I hate it
[2:58:32] Broomba: @cerealkillas22 need an inivte?
[2:58:42] TompsonX: Was jokerd a big streamer before he got the first classic level 60?
[2:58:47] Day_Walker78: https://www.tukui.org/download.php?client=win
[2:59:18] Zerfell: We did them in TOGC, made lots of gold then
[2:59:31] WillWoW: I mean think about it - WOTLK hasnt even dropped yet, lets play with the thought that it'll take like 1,5 year to progress through it - by that time MOP will be over TEN years old @Rexialiton
[2:59:34] Shrenko: so gold buyers won most things basically
[2:59:35] Aorszu: Its a junk system with guilds. Good for randoms
[2:59:45] valth: good times
[2:59:47] Fyris57: and at the raid of the raid the whole raid splits the gold from the sold items
[3:00:00] pk99: what guild runs GKDP internally LuL
[3:00:00] undesirableqq: We were doing naxx gdkp during ulduar
[3:00:05] Boats_NW: def keeps the gold farmers in business
[3:00:08] Magnarius: mine started in ICC
[3:00:17] stikheals: GDKP is the reason I quit classic
[3:00:22] Fyris57: gdkp was super fun in pugs during  ICC imo
[3:00:38] thmpr324: Why would the raid leader do it then??
[3:00:41] valth: farming AV at 70 for pvp gear.. so fun lawl
[3:00:43] jameinrrabaro: what is gdkp?
[3:00:44] Magnarius: I had the right to get one piece for free as a RL that is all
[3:00:46] Shrenko: best to join a guild and do normal guild runs
[3:00:47] abracka_: it's still largely the same. they have carries, then the buyers. there's not many that require gold flashes
[3:00:50] smorisha: we need personal loot asap
[3:00:57] Hafcool: Is it even worth it to play Classic when everything is basically GDKP  bound? @Towelliee
[3:01:00] alkazam_gg: it's not gonna be as bad on fresh server though right? on as much gold in circulation
[3:01:13] dreamwalker213: GDKPs are just the rich getting richer
[3:01:16] Kirorga: leading gdkps as a 13 yo cant believe ppl came to my runs
[3:01:17] jameinrrabaro: what is gdkp??
[3:01:30] 770Cash: buying gear is kinda cringe
[3:01:45] Fyris57: i was poor and made alot of gold in gdkp because i already had gear from raiding with my guild
[3:02:09] WillWoW: TL;DR - you bid on gear drops in raids instead of regular rolling @kalashiminov
[3:02:16] WillWoW: with gold
[3:02:26] Magnarius: my story ressemble to yours @Towelliee
[3:02:27] SilkeySmooth: what do you need gold for again in wrath?
[3:02:42] Fyris57: your mechano hog LUL
[3:02:50] dreamwalker213: Agreed
[3:02:50] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[3:02:52] PokerFaceMoose: people will stop raiding with guilds in order to make money in gdkp if their guild isnt running one
[3:02:57] Rexialiton: @WillWoW i know what you mean. but vanilla, tbc and wotlk is "classic" with wotlk is the least classic of the 3 imo. imo blizzard needs to think about how they should approach the newer "classic era". like mop etc. 10 years ago or not
[3:02:57] jameinrrabaro: @WillWoW oh, thx for the explain
[3:03:16] dreamwalker213: @silkeysmooth dalaran rings, vendor mounts, cold weather flying, a lot lol
[3:03:32] WillWoW: ya agreed tbf @Rexialiton one can only hope :D
[3:03:36] WillWoW: yw <3 @kalashiminov
[3:03:58] undesirableqq: hundreds
[3:03:59] Rexialiton: @WillWoW true xD
[3:04:06] Cenergy: There is constant ads in trade chat for GDKPs
[3:04:36] dreamwalker213: Normal pugs won’t exist and yes break guilds
[3:04:38] vaxster86: vaxster86 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:04:39] abracka_: there's about 10 ZA runs going on right now on benny, 8 of them are GDKP
[3:04:52] BlewGamingGroup: theres guilds now doing gdkp looting . if you arent farming gold ... youll be last to get geared
[3:05:21] doomester: @Towelliee how does GDKP works if you can explain pls?
[3:05:31] BlewGamingGroup: the old show up and get loot cause you have more points is over
[3:05:43] dreamwalker213: @doomester bid on loot drops for gold instead of rolling
[3:05:51] dreamwalker213: With gold*
[3:06:08] doomester: and how gold is distrube?
[3:06:13] tkzod: what's the problem with gdkp?  People participating get a share of the gold
[3:06:19] BlewGamingGroup: theres addons for it now that you can factor in all that shit to give out the payouts at the end of the run
[3:06:43] dreamwalker213: I don’t think the basis of GDKPs are bad. It’s the community that has turned it toxic
[3:06:44] cannibalcanyon: oh wow really? thats fucking awesome
[3:06:49] TompsonX: Does that mean retail will have GDKP or whatever it's called?
[3:06:56] N3llee: @Towelliee 100% bullshit you weren't among the list of top WoW streamers.
[3:07:26] Boats_NW: and its hella easy to make gold in retail
[3:07:42] Alaquane: retail you just buy your own carry
[3:08:01] Sadisticmedic: KEKW
[3:08:07] dreamwalker213: @tkzod most gdkps require a certain amount of gold to even get invited and no way you’ll get that kind of gold without farming for weeks
[3:08:13] ArcaneMaki: You're just the best WoW streamer. No need for list.
[3:08:17] Snabido: BACK IN DAYZ ERA
[3:08:18] Neziko: Was it another one of those streamer run things where most of their friends were the main people to be nominated lirl
[3:08:21] N3llee: think it was katako or something.. it was in my google news feed. Bahjeera, Asmon were listed
[3:08:25] KingoftheHatch: i still think that old raid content should have the weekly lock out removed so farming for transmog stuff does not take week to week
[3:08:31] Alienfromger: make a tierlist for wow streamers LUL
[3:08:32] abracka_: katako LOL
[3:08:33] Aorszu: I heard of you before asmon and soda
[3:08:35] Broomba: i remember that

[3:09:21] t_train_va: How is the shoulder?
[3:09:24] N3llee: it may have been
[3:09:29] abracka_: wowgrandma is the best wow streamer
[3:09:32] N3llee: it was in my ggogle news feed this morning
[3:09:43] Broomba: that top wow streamer is like a HS popularity poll -- so immature and stupid. Those who voted and participated in need to grow up
[3:10:01] Rodorann: 4chin lol
[3:10:07] MaximumSerg: Four chin

[3:46:17] Sherbert1492: hit the right time to see stream live woo
[3:46:17] Snabido: What, you dont like being let down after being hyped? Kappa
[3:46:24] TheFox0228: the Riot lore is suprisingly deep. I'm hoping they develop a good game to make it shine. I had no clue because I never played LoL or knew the lore KEKW

[3:48:34] TotallyNotRaien: i think riot would lose a ton of money if they made it anything other than f2p with micro transactions, i dont even think overlord tencent would allow it

[3:59:54] Buckwink: Wildstar PepeHands
[3:59:55] TombStoneMercenary: Do you see any hang ups with Dragon flight so far or do you think its pretty buttoned up?
[4:00:06] elchapoclencho: miss wildstar.. so much wasted potential
[4:00:15] themightygrove: looking forward to trying riots mmo
[4:00:15] StormDorfer: StormDorfer subscribed with Prime. 
[4:00:23] OhHiImRob: it's these mobs man, just low drop rate.
[4:00:27] wokeschizo: they are usually near the lumber-mill or w/e that is.
[4:00:27] infektyd: live in the wildstar private server sometimes for the copium
[4:00:39] WeedFranck: like 5% drop chance KEKW
[4:00:48] Voyburke: Is there an expansion in wow that noticeably increased recurring viewers for you?
[4:00:51] Featherbow: the shards are either the goblins or the basilisks
[4:01:00] gritbarontv: wouldn't be classic if drop rates are good
[4:01:18] Kale_Nd: @Towelliee you have to go back on the road and go south to the basilisk area
[4:01:21] infektyd: new world streamer... >.>
[4:01:21] gryn: WoW Is DeAd SIKE
[4:01:36] Day_Walker78: i wonder when the new Star Wars mmo gona come out

[4:01:38] cerealkillas22: well theres a lot to do in wow
[4:01:42] cerealkillas22: theres not a lot to do in Swtor really
[4:01:52] TompsonX: How's Lost Ark doing on viewership nowadays?
[4:01:54] Cranghoul: because of asmongold lol
[4:02:00] abracka_: XIV isn't as enjoyable to watch
[4:02:04] Sathalan: I like ESO but for me it pales in comparison to ff14. I went through endwalker a second time instead of do more ESO story towSip
[4:02:08] 3dobbee: world first race a real big nowadays all the guilds stream it
[4:02:13] Jarlan23: i liked ff14 and i'll probably go back every expansion to to the main story
[4:02:19] tebbix: I wonder why FFXIV streams are not popular
[4:02:20] Jarlan23: but the combat in that game isnt for me
[4:02:45] Cranghoul: FFXIV is just boring to watch
[4:02:45] gritbarontv: because they don't like spoilers

[4:03:10] Sadisticmedic: Zeal , Saintone, Modz are doing well with Lost Ark
[4:03:27] TompsonX: Because no one wants spolers
[4:03:28] WeedFranck: new world KEKW
[4:03:34] Ithylz: Isn't combat in FF14 much slower than WoW?
[4:03:38] seedwolfmgo: aint nobody got time for that LUL
[4:04:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: thats just means 99k viewers didn't buy the game LUL
[4:04:18] TompsonX: I watch Modz everyday YEP
[4:04:23] crittinkitten: Asmongold got more than 99k on one of his random ff14 streams
[4:04:32] gritbarontv: we hungry for xpacs
[4:04:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: i didnt watch this stream until i was well past you in the story
[4:04:56] Shrenko: like a month after
[4:05:06] Kinghorn: coxNod
[4:05:06] TotallyNotRaien: is the ff14 story even good
[4:05:15] Moronil: @TotallyNotRaien oh yes.
[4:05:18] TompsonX: YEs
[4:05:23] gritbarontv: subjective
[4:05:29] Hybridwarhawk: FFXIV story is amazing, imo
[4:05:42] Alaquane: I liked the story.
[4:05:49] Moronil: endwalker story was.. a journey.
[4:05:53] foofighters182: KomodoHype
[4:06:03] Day_Walker78: @Towelliee  you gona try the new Star Wars mmo when it comes out or if it will come out ofc thats Ubisoft is gona make ?

[4:06:18] Merex760: yeah i don't think he's touched the new patches either cause of that lol
[4:06:23] gritbarontv: lol
[4:06:24] Kale_Nd: @Day_Walker78 wait what? a new star wars mmo ?
[4:06:25] Convectus: theres no mmo like wow. game engine wise, its unmatched. the feel of combat cant be reached
[4:06:27] Merex760: waiting till the end of the expansion
[4:06:37] jmitche82: Do you think you'll keep playing classic when Dragonflight comes out?
[4:06:42] ArcaneMaki: Yeah I was not playing FF14 for the game systems.
[4:06:52] Day_Walker78: @Convectus https://www.ubisoft.com/snowdrop/games/the-star-wars-project
[4:06:59] Jarlan23: i think swtors story was overall more consistant but ff has higher highs
[4:07:00] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: I rather experience it myself. The story is that good
[4:07:04] xotankkk: double gays
[4:07:09] TompsonX: I played the story, played a couple of weeks after then left

[4:07:55] Moronil: 7.0 comes with a big graphical update, will be interesting
[4:07:57] Alaquane: Game description reads like assassin's creed in star wars
[4:08:09] Sadisticmedic: I dont play FF so I wouldn't matter
[4:08:16] TotallyNotRaien: i cant get into ff14 the graphics are weird
[4:08:17] xendros78: I didn't watch twitch at all while leveling through endwalker, turned off in game chat too
[4:08:38] WeedFranck: bop
[4:08:47] Taco117: i only watch the raids in ff14
[4:08:54] WeedFranck: close fight
[4:09:07] Kinghorn: those basalisks hit hard
[4:09:08] CardinalTX: I really like FF dungeons and raids.......story is great but quests suck
[4:09:18] Leemann9: i get 800 per kill no rest
[4:09:20] Alaquane: Is that drunk penguin not gonna help you fight?
[4:10:01] Moronil: savage dungeons coming in like a month or less
[4:10:18] jswatte: criterion?
[4:10:34] Day_Walker78: i just hope the new star wars story driven open world game will be good
[4:10:44] maccaruso: I believe they are called crapola dungeons
[4:11:02] Exxcar: He didn't want to
[4:11:06] Alaquane: Variant, Criterion, and Criterion (Savage)
[4:11:13] Exxcar: Playerbase pushed him
[4:11:13] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:11:24] Exxcar: Its one of the most requested things in FF
[4:11:27] ArcaneMaki: to appeal western audienc
[4:11:44] Exxcar: He was asked like a year ago if they would do M+ and he flat out said no
[4:11:44] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:12:07] smashwow: wait what?
[4:12:26] Alaquane: He did blame the playerbase for male Bunny characters
[4:12:38] TotallyNotRaien: do you think making all raids 10man would help the game?
[4:12:39] Austei: Lfr one my fav
[4:12:43] CardinalTX: The game needed more content once you are through the story and geared
[4:12:44] WeedFranck: ohhh monkey time
[4:12:52] BobLongMVP: 18
[4:12:53] Alaquane: 7 gorillas
[4:12:54] cerealkillas22: not many
[4:12:57] cerealkillas22: a couple
[4:12:57] Jarless: 14
[4:12:58] Velarn435: I feel like wow started transmog too
[4:12:58] Taco117: 69
[4:13:01] WeedFranck: so, 63.6% xp to.... KEKW
[4:13:01] TheBroCrow: At least 12
[4:13:02] xendros78: 20
[4:13:06] maccaruso: Depends.  How many gorillas are in WoW?
[4:13:07] ExanimisGG: 25
[4:13:11] Metternic: just monkeying around ya know
[4:13:11] mewkittymon: 25
[4:13:12] icyflame70: 3
[4:13:15] Hybridwarhawk: 42
[4:13:17] trivotix: m+ has kept the expansions more relevant for longer. It kept people logging in for more than just raid day.
[4:13:20] Moronil: I wish wow had more horizontal content, that's why I prefer ff14 for now
[4:13:21] D3m0nHunt3r666: 45
[4:13:34] Tiamarilien: 15
[4:13:37] puglife1988x: someone has clearly not done this quest if their answer is "7"
[4:13:37] Strouss: @chat and @Towelliee DO you know how to activate the kite in wrath? i got teh phase walker but im not sure how to get the Kite i bought the big upgrade, i have the boost waiting for when the server opens for it.
[4:13:42] Dankind64: ... sex?
[4:13:45] Aidler: we talking 4 figures?
[4:13:47] Austei: buzz words heh
[4:13:47] smashwow: the kind you can do laying down?
[4:13:52] WeedFranck: that quest is so good when skinning is learned :)
[4:13:56] IronPhalanX: ERP
[4:14:03] HaxzorJimDuggan: things that dont make you stronger
[4:14:10] TompsonX: Vertical means item level and power level
[4:14:16] Exxcar: @Towelliee esentially not player progression
[4:14:19] LunaKura: I guess it's same as linear
[4:14:19] Moronil: a lot of systems created around collectables, dragonriding is a GREAT start
[4:14:19] TompsonX: Horizontal is cosmetics and mounts in WoW
[4:14:20] Syllvn: content not on the gear treadmill
[4:14:20] maccaruso: Content which does not empower your character (i.e. mog)
[4:14:21] MaybeRespect: Non player power content that still give rewards.
[4:14:22] Alaquane: yall just making up terms now
[4:14:24] Exxcar: So Pet battles are a form of horizontal contednt
[4:14:26] Tyrsfal: think like island sanctuary stuff in FF
[4:14:28] LadySaaph: @Strouss Talk to innkeeper
[4:14:29] Dankind64: they don't know either. they heard someone say it and just parrot it
[4:14:38] coeebra: coeebra subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:14:47] t_train_va: Nah, horizontal has been around for a long time
[4:14:48] 310toyuumi: I swear it’s made up tho
[4:14:48] TheGiant99: Lost Ark refered to content as horizxontalk
[4:14:49] TotallyNotRaien: horizontal content just gets boring, i prefer the happy juices you get from gear drops
[4:14:54] abracka_: it's provocative, it gets the people goin
[4:14:54] alucardais: i think vert is like gold saucer
[4:14:55] Convectus: @Dankind64 haha so true
[4:14:55] t_train_va: GW was horizontal for a long time
[4:14:59] Lambyyx: the main things I want to see from wow is more social content and more effort in pvp
[4:15:00] foofighters182: more diagonal content
[4:15:05] maccaruso: Guild Wars II not so much but most others, yes
[4:15:08] MaybeRespect: @TotallyNotRaien Should have both. Not 1 or the other
[4:15:10] TotallyNotRaien: think like gw2, with ascended gear being the best gear you can get
[4:15:13] shale93: gw2 doesnt after ascended gear and thats my turn off
[4:15:18] Rexialiton: 18 apes
[4:15:20] 310toyuumi: Spoiler DF is exactly like classic.
[4:15:25] TompsonX: Yeah, you're supposed to have both types of content, in Lost Ark Vertical content = item level and raiding  Horizontal content = collections and islands
[4:15:26] Strouss: humm i dont see anything at the INNkeeper.
[4:15:31] 310toyuumi: With more voice acting
[4:15:42] tiyanigean: diagonal content are mythic only mounts. braggin rights & good loot
[4:15:47] WeedFranck: yeah
[4:15:52] WeedFranck: who said 8?
[4:15:58] Austei: .....
[4:16:02] gritbarontv: reason I can't really play classic I have grinding PTSD
[4:16:06] TheBroCrow: KEKW
[4:16:07] TompsonX: Yeah, I have no idea what people want to add for horizontal content in WoW, It already has plenty lol

[4:16:28] Exxcar: Don't worry chat, the secret streamer buff is a lie!
[4:16:30] 310toyuumi: All I want WoW to add is mythic level gear for 20 keys
[4:16:32] MaybeRespect: @TompsonX Because it's all the same. Daily quests, rep. Thats about it.
[4:16:52] TheGiant99: Its all the same in <Lost Ark also
[4:17:01] positive_ions: mount and loot gambling, that's it

[4:17:03] StormDorfer: they just need to do more things like the chromie scenario
[4:17:12] Dreyahri: wow has so much horizontal progression, you could just get to level 60 and stop gearing, start life skilling, clearing all the side stories, achievements and the mounts and such
[4:17:13] HebbyB: I feel like it was more fun in Legion, like more tolerable to do over and over
[4:17:13] jswatte: the housing and player created events in ff is th big thing from what I see
[4:17:17] rbolude: i think people confuse having horizontal content with liking it. WoW has a ton, if people like it or not that's a different thing
[4:17:17] TompsonX: I'm pretty sure you have thousands of achievments, mounts and transmogs to farm through different means
[4:17:19] Exxcar: That's all player power
[4:17:19] 310toyuumi: BFA was unironically good
[4:17:23] smashwow: not power systems
[4:17:24] UltraKSlaya: yes! Legion was the best, it was just tied to player power
[4:17:26] maccaruso: Systems that don't make your character more powerful
[4:17:27] nisuunlite: its called horizontal progression not content lol
[4:17:31] jacooners: i think mage tower is a good ex sinceits optional and not power
[4:17:35] MaybeRespect: Thats all player power though. Not horizontal
[4:17:35] StormDorfer: current mage tower is horizontal content like woah
[4:17:38] UltraKSlaya: BFA was fun
[4:17:39] TheGiant99: wow has a shit ton of hoprizontal content
[4:17:43] UltraKSlaya: I do miss corruption
[4:17:52] Aidler: everyone thinks legion was one of the best recent expansions and now they are going a completly different route... odd
[4:17:53] Austei: lol
[4:18:00] Dreyahri: the pet battle system is a great example of horizontal content to
[4:18:05] Arkitek: @MaybeRespect pet battles, transmog hunting etc
[4:18:07] DecayedmiNt: My man said Warfront was player power
[4:18:08] 310toyuumi: Yeah it was diagonal content lol
[4:18:09] MaybeRespect: Corruption is considered collecting? idk
[4:18:10] TompsonX: Pog
[4:18:10] jacooners: no b/c then its required lol
[4:18:16] Dankind64: Pog i was here
[4:18:17] Dreyahri: you don't need it for end game but you could spend 1k hours getting all the pets etc lol
[4:18:24] TheBroCrow: NOTED
[4:18:24] gritbarontv: it was vertical cause you will level up
[4:18:27] Shamwise: "WOW is Verizontal" - Towelliee 2022
[4:18:27] TotallyNotRaien: wow players are such creatures.... everybody absolutely hated bfa with a passion and now its a good expansion
[4:18:28] Hippwn: I like herticle better
[4:18:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: more like diagonal content Kappa
[4:18:35] Exxcar: Essentially what I've taken "horizontal progression" is something like player housing, where there is zero player power tied to it at all, but still something you can work to progress, that also doesn't out right require specific player power level
[4:18:42] abracka_: nobody knows what any of this means but it's provocative and gets the people going
[4:18:44] 310toyuumi: Omg verizon vertical horizon it’s a conspiracy
[4:18:46] TompsonX: Could you ignore corruption?
[4:18:47] Broomba: horizontal content = meta
[4:18:48] Rexialiton: im so freaking confused over this conversation LUL
[4:18:54] Bigmann109: Definitely diagonal
[4:18:57] ArcaneMaki: Damn now I understand where Verizon got their name
[4:18:59] TheBroCrow: Why does Verizontal sound like an off-brand Verizon that's even shittier
[4:19:00] TheGiant99: the horizontal content in Lost Ark has player power as well. Since you get skill points from some of it
[4:19:03] Tiamarilien: towSip towPog
[4:19:04] JokaThS: you cant tell me islands and warfronts didnt have cosmetics and mounts and tittles
[4:19:06] Hybridwarhawk: I want that on a t-shirt
[4:19:22] Z3r0Fear: !keys
[4:19:22] Moobot: @Z3r0Fear KEYS ARE DAMN CLOSE! LONG STREAMS THIS WEEK! . All keys will be given away there. discord.gg/towelliee & TWITCH CHAT
[4:19:22] Dreyahri: vertical progression is like, the real endgame starts when you hit 60 and get the minimum item level for the lowest tier of raids and dungeons, to then gear further and further
[4:19:27] OhHiImRob: hurticle perhaps
[4:19:45] 310toyuumi: It was all about the mounts, AP was a sweet bonus
[4:19:47] tiyanigean: @TompsonX yes. never farmed the stuff, cleared aotc and 4 m bosses. farmed lots of mounts around Uldum, tho
[4:20:29] TompsonX: People usually complain that they don't wanna be forced to do that type of content, kind of like the argument about Thorgast having been awesome IF it wasn't mandatory and actually challenging on release
[4:20:31] Bennyrahma: What mod is that that is showing the red skulls on the map?
[4:20:36] 310toyuumi: I restarted my third character on fresh someone hold me. I just want a DK
[4:20:42] MaybeRespect: have to remember, if people feel forced, i.e. island AP grind being BiS. People are turned off, even if they have cosmetic rewards.
[4:20:47] WeedFranck: pretty sure they are, they are near the ogre cave if I remember
[4:20:48] alex12645: i cant rember it ben to long
[4:21:04] TotallyNotRaien: i think torghast is fantastic, i just wish it wasnt all dull and gray
[4:21:05] TompsonX: Yeah!
[4:21:11] MaybeRespect: Mage tower 100%. And everyone loved it.
[4:21:14] TompsonX: Also achivements
[4:21:19] TompsonX: That's also horizontal nowadays
[4:21:21] Dreyahri: yea! its not mandatory at all, but its there as an extra challenge
[4:21:31] TompsonX: Absolutely, yes
[4:21:43] TompsonX: I think it has plenty, I don't know what people want more added to it tbh
[4:21:48] TompsonX: Islands in Lost Ark are boring af
[4:21:48] rbolude: island expeditions NOW is horizontal content if u go in max level to farm mog/mounts/etc
[4:21:52] Aidler: @MaybeRespect na.. I didn't but I have nothing against it
[4:21:53] Moronil: I didn't say it didn't have any, I just said it had "more"
[4:21:57] ArcaneMaki: Love the buzz words police in here :D
[4:21:58] Syllvn: if torghast was transmogs etc only and not legendary related it would have been great
[4:22:14] gritbarontv: are ever going to do something with the achievement points
[4:22:16] MaybeRespect: @Aidler Majority did, never can be 100%
[4:22:17] ole94_: !keys
[4:22:17] Moobot: @Inferus KEYS ARE DAMN CLOSE! LONG STREAMS THIS WEEK! . All keys will be given away there. discord.gg/towelliee & TWITCH CHAT
[4:22:20] TompsonX: Yeah, but imagine if you were still doing that until today toweliee
[4:22:24] CruzM8: yeah they were a ton of fun when it first came out
[4:22:30] TompsonX: You stopped playing a while ago haha
[4:22:36] Dreyahri: some islands LUL got me all emotional and stuff lol woah, but most of them are just a collectors addiction ahah
[4:22:49] Snabido: They're gonna increase that achievement progress bar on each category because you want it higher
[4:22:58] gritbarontv: I mean a store for collecting mogs
[4:23:03] TompsonX: Yeah, people are still doing them daily for gold and stuff
[4:23:06] Z3r0Fear: Yup
[4:23:11] DunesGames: had to stop lost ark b/c of my hand
[4:23:14] tiyanigean: at this point achievement points seem more like a "want something to do? what about this:..." kinda stuff.
[4:23:35] TheGiant99: I loved Lost Ark but literally doing the same thing every single day got very very old
[4:23:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: as soon as bots started showing up in instanced tier 3 content i was out
[4:23:39] TotallyNotRaien: even tho people love to meme on it, WoW truly is such a great game
[4:23:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: in lost ark
[4:24:00] kaihole: @tiyanigean it's always been like that in every game though hasn't it?
[4:24:00] WeedFranck: Clap
[4:24:13] Aorszu: They were
[4:24:31] gritbarontv: they spawned faster originally
[4:24:43] warn1ng: i quit after leveling alts, and seeing all the bots in lost ark just run through walls at light speed
[4:24:50] TheGiant99: DatModz literally does the same exact thing ewvery single day....
[4:24:51] MyerHQ: cus bots
[4:24:52] WeedFranck: those ogres was elite
[4:24:52] TompsonX: I've been seeing a bunch of bots in Vern again haha
[4:24:59] gritbarontv: so you would die because I get ambushed
[4:25:02] MaybeRespect: 1% honing rate lol. Mass exodus
[4:25:12] tiyanigean: @kaihole often yes. maybe its just more obvious now that theres so much of them ^^
[4:25:17] cocus_the_red: !keys
