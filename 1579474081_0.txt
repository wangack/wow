[2:12:21] moonwarrwow: did u play prot warr in DF
[2:12:26] CrusaderNero: @Steelsky_ I dont know, but I would assume so? 3 HP to cast it and it takes 3 secs. way to long tbh
[2:12:31] CrusaderNero: 3 secs is alot
[2:12:51] ankan91swe: key giveaway ? beta
[2:13:19] BoezIRL: less people would level if they have premade 70
[2:13:29] Cajete: @Towelliee What do you personally use for information on server pop for classic?
[2:13:30] davidewo: LUL
[2:13:52] ErosnPsyche: cant imagine how much $$$ they are saving by letting players test the game
[2:13:58] ErosnPsyche: for free
[2:14:11] Zomgboy: Hi Bob, you look alot bigger
[2:14:30] Steelsky_: @ErosnPsyche There's internal testers man, every company has them and closed focus groups

[2:15:04] neverbornlucky: bob broke it he didn't fix it
[2:15:14] ErosnPsyche: @Steelsky_ ofc theres is, but u are missing the point
[2:15:24] Tjenne92: hahahaha
[2:15:27] zenkodac: i mean thats the thing if blizz lets people do what they wanted nothing would be tested so beta wouldnt even have a point
[2:15:42] Hartaz: is that warcraft 3 music in the game (dragonflight) ?
[2:16:05] BoezIRL: lot's of company have public test environment
[2:16:09] zenkodac: its already annoying everyone that gets this things mostly logs in for 1 hours and leaves for the rest of the whole alpha/beta cycle
[2:16:19] Antoinas: i heard AW is 3 mins for RET is that true?
[2:16:25] Steelsky_: Isn't moment filling the same niche as toll?
[2:17:11] captiv8: Did they add in game music?
[2:17:17] Steelsky_: Bubble taunt seems way more accessible too
[2:19:51] Steelsky_: Tyr + Bulwark seems crazy powerful for dungeons

[2:23:22] SirApo6: @vimie oh thank you
[2:23:30] NewWorldReign: They're doing BETA a bit late right, or has BETA always been 2 months prior to the actual expansion?
[2:23:57] captiv8: Sounds like sentinel should be a capstone talent.

[2:24:18] LunaKura: @Towelliee It is the shortest, but it is probably the most polished too
[2:24:21] neverbornlucky: we already know when dragon flight is coming the alpha and beta seem shorted one for the expansion I remember
[2:24:22] NewWorldReign: So DF could be released earlier than scheduled?
[2:24:26] Siglius: KEKW

[2:34:58] KaisenSiru: SeemsGood
[2:35:05] Kaernunnos: no big stream announcmeent of beta
[2:35:09] Collected1: stealth beta release
[2:35:23] xrandomdoodx: do you think it's a good sign that they're openly letting big amounts of people test this early? or desperation? lol
[2:35:36] LunaKura: @Towelliee An intern pulled the beta rip cord xD
[2:35:39] probioticx: last minute decision maybe
[2:35:51] Tjenne92: i mean its not a bad thing... to be fair
[2:36:14] Tjenne92: more serious testers this way i would assume
[2:36:15] Collected1: Ion did kind of leak it in that Max interview when he said "beta" then corrected himself to "alpha"
[2:36:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's almost like Blizzard tricked streamers into playing Wrath this week LUL
[2:36:23] ratgefingah: u even denied beta coming out the other stream cuz u thought they wanted ppl to play wrath
[2:36:41] Dynamorh: based on what you've seen to far rate DF out of 10

[2:37:15] Zomgboy: i dont have a subscription so i dont think i get beta
[2:37:19] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  maybe it's the haste talent being buggy?
[2:37:26] Jack_the_Dipper: Twitter Functionality in WoW? Is that new?
[2:37:31] srze94: prot pala still top dps in leveling dungeons, phew
[2:37:38] Irisfarr: working as intended
[2:37:41] Collected1: this dungeon feels old school
[2:37:58] KaisenSiru: It's the haste talent yeah
[2:38:13] KaisenSiru: I read that on the Red discord it was giving 100% haste
[2:38:23] Demanisraar: holy shit that haste LUL

[4:18:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZdodge

[4:19:43] scumlucki: @Collected1 i bought the epic editionof df and a  6 month sub not a email in sight
[4:19:45] r0bswan: pre ordering should guarantee and beta access thats how it is in every other game, including d4
[4:19:51] conquestandvictory: I think they should just send invites a lot more aggressively , like get as many ppl in as the servers can hold to make testing proper
[4:20:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: I opted in during the reveal, and I didn't get in.....so they must choose on a number of factors
[4:20:35] tyler2tall89: @conquestandvictory I mean i think theyre having sserver issues, was a 3 hour que time to log into benediction last night
[4:20:36] dan_monk: gottem

[4:30:30] xxeazyryderxx: xxeazyryderxx subscribed with Prime. 
[4:30:32] Qwazaar: naw, prob best looking show I have seen
[4:30:48] Tharia: cool. I'll check it out then
[4:30:52] Lupusdeus: @Towelliee do you know if taking Spellwarding does actually replace BoP or if you can have both?
[4:30:52] ToastLamoan: how does something look annoying?

[4:31:35] ShadyWire: ShadyWire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! beta hype
[4:31:38] Kaernunnos: elvui calls it paging
[4:31:39] exbuddha: use a second set of keybindings?
[4:31:54] Armdel: missed first ring i think?
[4:31:55] CmdKookie: I think you missed the first
[4:31:59] Skizzurp: u missed 1st on ei think
[4:32:10] lalelusa: don't keybinds switch pages with alt?
[4:32:11] Tagliari: wth?
[4:32:25] Lupusdeus: @TobiSways Not if they had some kind of joint cd interaction
[4:32:59] ToastLamoan: @Towelliee some of these quests show a question mark turn in but no npc

[4:34:30] Tharia: log in to your bnet launcher and see. grats if you did
[4:35:07] Lupusdeus: @TobiSways I guess my point is, forcing us to take bop only to swap it out on the next talent seems shit, they should just make the 1st point be a choice node. We already have a janky class tree
[4:35:10] ShadyWire: is the beta open for everyone?
[4:35:19] Sevax: No its not
[4:35:20] OldYce: @ShadyWire no only on invites

[4:35:44] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: We have a guy in our guild,who didnt sign up for beta and got it, but 2 others me included,who actually signed up for it didnt get it. And he doesnt even want to play. I'm so mad
[4:35:53] OldYce: Im from the EU and got beta yesterday
[4:36:05] Tharia: yeah that sucks
[4:36:14] ZakuzaGB: its not in my launcher but i think the email is legit. same email they send all the other emails about wrath etc
[4:36:39] r0bswan: Does summoning your dragonriding mount has a special animation now?
[4:36:40] Sykum: ooh nice
[4:37:05] JStevenson: Dragon riding skills are account wide right? @towelliee
[4:37:16] Lupusdeus: @TobiSways they changed that, wings is baseline now.
[4:37:17] TheCliffyShow: Are any mods made for beta yet. I know addons are allowed but are any made yet.
[4:37:47] r0bswan: @TheCliffyShow There is details on upper left
[4:37:50] Lupusdeus: @TobiSways or at least, we dont need to spend as many points
[4:38:05] Lupusdeus: @TobiSways Never hope as ret bro ;)
