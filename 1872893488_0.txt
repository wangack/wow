[0:24:04] Kenesu_Bav: it will help the process and soldering. and make it by far easier.
[0:24:12] magzybogus: the bad thing is that you can't measure capacitors, you only need to check for the one/ones that are swollen
[0:24:24] Kenesu_Bav: yup

[1:32:51] gilbertmd666: Remember it the political people who want the electric cars to be used. When u need to redo the power grid first before u get those cars to work right
[1:32:52] DigitalPolice: @evanjf10 well batteries just to make them are bad and then land fields when they die is going to be horrid
[1:32:58] evanjf10: Nobody talks about how much emissions it takes to make cars like tesla.
[1:33:21] somename91: @digitalpolice fun fact. It's also very hard to recycle lithium from those batteries and almost nobody does it, even tho lithium is quickly running out as a relatively rare metal.
[1:33:30] hellran1: I built electric cabin less  cars yet deive petrol /gas cars
[1:33:45] MrQuicksilver22: @evanjf10  Don't agree loads of people are talking about it, more and more for sure

[1:35:33] evanjf10: No, they aren't but it should be talked about. And Swifty is right DC level 3 are the fastest chargers and they charge 80% in 20 minutes which is still not convenient.
