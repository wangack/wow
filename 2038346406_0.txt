[0:05:45] inhumed: everyone crying too much about the armor mitigation when they don't understand K value and mitigation.   everyone actually gained more EHP with the stam buff and the spread isn't as drastic

[0:10:20] belvedee: yeah they'll need to adjust demon skin for demo
[0:10:20] flyingorangee: xdd meanwhile dh untouched KEKW
[0:10:24] BCboy_: will we see the nunruki holy priest dream with the buffs next week?
[0:10:25] sweeziest: I think warlocks and DKs will have the most to gain/lose from this

[0:13:25] Sosatko: it’s just so easy to blast on DH I feel like
[0:13:29] Shezzmou: that opener though
[0:13:30] Sosatko: 3 buttons 200k dps lol
[0:13:34] Somanie: yeoo
[0:13:37] XxGarthakxX: Good for Feral one shots in WPvP
[0:13:51] Somanie: what up, I'm about to drug my cat
[0:14:10] Sosatko: did you see those insane rogue nerfs their gonna be unplayable 😂
[0:14:13] DrewPBallz18: thats crazy how much conquest u got
[0:14:19] Sosatko: it’s amazing how they dodge every real nerf for 20 years
[0:14:27] DrewPBallz18: they nerfed rouge?
[0:14:53] Symo85: evening sir
[0:14:53] XxGarthakxX: Shadow Priest feels good. lvling one rn
[0:15:15] jdawgmyg: When do the buffs kick in
[0:15:22] XxGarthakxX: 23rd
[0:15:24] Shezzmou: i think the armor thing was meh but then i though about dk and what hunters do to them...
[0:15:29] Axtin: mornin
[0:15:34] Ambersulfr: you gotta balance for the rookies
[0:15:45] Ambersulfr: they’re what makes the mmr rise
[0:15:53] Sosatko: you balance around anything as long as rogues are best xd
[0:16:16] Sosatko: I just think it’d be cool for one single awc to not be rogue X X
[0:16:19] tv_raz: lol im 8 and 0 on my lock in 2s too played with roxxy on his frost mage
[0:16:22] Somanie: EZ 4pc
[0:16:38] Axtin: ven do u use a coffee warmer pad
[0:16:40] Sosatko: I’m excited tho I miss awc
[0:16:55] Shezzmou: whatever gives you biggest mastery bump
[0:17:04] DrewPBallz18: lets run it
[0:17:18] BCboy_: honor tokens for trophies of strife?
[0:17:30] Particulation: only thing i ever warm up is my pizza pop
[0:17:42] kusoneko: 2 set is what makes dh pop off
[0:17:43] Infidel_Tech: NOOOO
[0:17:57] Infidel_Tech: lol
[0:18:49] KaptinKazual: @kusoneko you don't think being able to get up to 5 hunts in match (depending on length) is a pop off?
[0:18:57] Shezzmou: gotta run glimpse and chaotic the 3rd ones the one you switch out
[0:19:00] KaptinKazual: also, OOF 7 ads soon as I enter the channel
[0:19:18] Ambersulfr: no idea
[0:19:40] kazekwow: im really hoping the balancing is good for my shadow priest

[0:23:30] gelatokush: need to cap my hpriest u need a healer for 2s ? :d
[0:23:36] nosewheelies: dude i do hvac and last week i put in over 100 hours
[0:23:41] nosewheelies: im from edmonton
[0:24:00] wallstreet12345: Icy veins specc
[0:24:06] Nachofez: i love cold
[0:24:08] own3dzz: sounds like calgary
[0:24:08] Axtin: ven these ret buffs might be too much
[0:24:10] anacronz: @venruki what you think about warriors next patch? Unplayable?
[0:24:26] nicoros61: Take it back. It's -10C in East Tennessee right now.  We are not built for this
[0:24:41] Axtin: surprised they didnt just buff rets tier
[0:24:58] Shezzmou: @Axtin right!
[0:24:59] ferahgok: def, although they are getting less armor too., but def net positive
[0:25:08] younotmytwin: We love a ret ssn easy games they still die so easily lol
[0:25:11] anacronz: Cause armour
[0:25:16] Sosatko: nothing in wow is unplayable lmao
[0:25:17] DrewPBallz18: r u doin viewer games
[0:25:24] wallstreet12345: Warrs already have bad burst. Maybe the increased HP will be more dampening games so MS might get better?
[0:25:33] Ambersulfr: list up and I have some time to heal some 2s
[0:25:36] Sosatko: just because your spec isn’t S+++ doesn’t make it unplayable guys
[0:25:38] younotmytwin: Dh is gonna replace the warr
[0:25:39] Paybacks: I feel like the armor changes are way smaller in overall dmg% than people realize
[0:25:46] Stealthgam3r: was thinking the same for ww monk
[0:25:51] nameyourform: isnt there a talent for warrior that makes them do more dmg based on armor?
[0:25:56] Shezzmou: as far as plate goes DK is the only one that is gonna have some issues with physical dam
[0:26:17] Stealthgam3r: longer games / ms more value
[0:26:25] clydeytv_: the fear change is big for warlock too
[0:26:27] Stealthgam3r: assa rogues too
[0:26:31] clydeytv_: for destro its gonna be like a mini stun
[0:26:33] Cammyz: I feel like right now wizards are already hard to kill, with this change they're going to feel immortal
[0:26:34] clydeytv_: fear bolt boom!
[0:26:41] zachgamegodx: ven
[0:26:42] zachgamegodx: im so sad
[0:26:49] zachgamegodx: i didnt get to see ur reaction to the changes
[0:26:54] duckfeet12: where even are the pally buffs
[0:26:55] Sosatko: I was shocked they did that finally it was long over due
[0:27:02] ferahgok: I'm surprised they didn't have the foresight to consider that with warlock. No way intended is it?
[0:27:11] zachgamegodx: they're so big u need 2 reactions !
[0:27:13] Nachofez: as a hunter player im happy for the plate nerfs, i hate getting ran down by warriors
[0:27:32] Sosatko: hunters are upset they can’t afk and press rapid fire and auto beat mages 😂
[0:27:34] zachgamegodx: tbf they prolly made it 750 cause conquest is uncapped
[0:27:38] whspe: are we about to say hello to our ret overlords?
[0:27:45] ImJordanHi: Holy FRICK 650k, you're rich
[0:28:04] smoothytoothy: lilillqt Pog
[0:28:17] zachgamegodx: in 2 or 3 days youre gonna have perf gear on all your chars
[0:28:24] anacronz: Should I stick with my main char even after nerfs? Or delete game?
[0:28:26] zachgamegodx: how do u feel
[0:28:32] zachgamegodx: im feelin good aobut that
[0:28:35] gelatokush: i just posted a lfg grp for 2s and 8 ret paladins have signed  up in a sec... coincidence?
[0:28:38] Badasti: yo
[0:28:43] Ambersulfr: rets are either going to one shot you or die before they touch you
[0:28:46] Ambersulfr: there will be no inbetween
[0:29:03] zachgamegodx: There are things higher on my radar
[0:29:04] Sosatko: ret demo damp making a comeback
[0:29:07] reedthesham: same with enhance
[0:29:11] KaptinKazual: I mean casters get wrecked/trained hard at lower-mid ratings, a lot of caster classes don't really get to play - play until 1800 plus.  But after 1800, casters start to push back hard all ready.
[0:29:19] reedthesham: :P
[0:29:22] zachgamegodx: I think the pacing of the game will favor elemental shamans, but rdruids being weaker compromises those guys
[0:29:30] Badasti: i gave in and levelled my demon hunter
[0:29:34] Badasti: what an absurd class
[0:29:38] zachgamegodx: DId u see the fury change -- a talent that we'll NEVER use
[0:29:45] Axtin: the stam buff is also a buff to dark pact/shield of vengeance
[0:29:47] Sosatko: it won’t matter much
[0:29:48] duckfeet12: where are the buffs so i can read them
[0:29:49] Ambersulfr: it's a 5% buff to every other healer basically...
[0:29:55] Ambersulfr: but yeah I don't think it's going to make them go away
[0:29:57] luckydyldo: i dont think it does much since they didnt touch any healers other than hpriest
[0:30:03] zachgamegodx: it cdrs ravager tho, u know how useless ravager is into somebody who moves out of it
[0:30:09] WhereMaldo: rets about to be the new #1
[0:30:14] Zumaji: I’m calling it now, demo,ret pally,shaman is winning aws
[0:30:23] cubsthemonk: yes that would be cool
[0:30:25] Zumaji: demo/ret will be bonkers again
[0:30:30] zachgamegodx: and the armor buff hurts fury the most
[0:30:31] AblazeING: will take forever with that transmog  <3
[0:30:44] zachgamegodx: aside from outlaw i guess, but outlaw was way too good to begin with
[0:30:45] Shezzmou: if the armor changes are impactful at all then Demo will be the meta at the top of the ladder
[0:30:46] figurines: @zachgamegodx it gives you the main stat if you talent into it regardless of if anyone is in it
[0:30:48] KaptinKazual: You really think Rsham and not Rdruid, Zumaji?
[0:30:49] snakesandfoxes: let's gooo
[0:30:51] Ambersulfr: I'm so glad I'm not qing healer rn
[0:30:52] kusoneko: so like every dh
[0:30:56] Snewch: Watch him go 6-0
[0:30:56] reedthesham: its easy
[0:30:57] Badasti: haha, if you dont get rolled then 2.1k in 5 shuffs :P
[0:30:57] WhereMaldo: maybe I’m just bad but the DH burst rotation seems tough
[0:31:00] Ambersulfr: this is why climbing out of 2k is hell btw
[0:31:00] reedthesham: you're gonna be fine
[0:31:03] Fayce123: It's time to PUMP
[0:31:04] KaptinKazual: Why don't you have A Fire Inside?
[0:31:08] IamWalnuts: if you do okay dam and press Dark your better than most 2k dh players
[0:31:09] zachgamegodx: @figurines if you take hurricane than ur set is useless pretty much
[0:31:18] zachgamegodx: ur forced to run the crushing blow build
[0:31:23] ImPlutooo: best healer for beginners to WoW pvp?
[0:31:25] figurines: @zachgamegodx if ur running ravager you shouldnt be running 2 or 4 set
[0:31:28] deltabreeze_2: Ven we ever getting a house tour?
[0:31:33] zachgamegodx: ye ravager blows
[0:31:40] duckfeet12: WHERE CAN I FIND THESE BUFF NOTES
[0:31:47] Ambersulfr: wowhead has them
[0:31:54] Axtin: @duckfeet12 https://www.wowhead.com/blue-tracker/topic/us/class-tuning-incoming-january-23-1770076

[0:31:55] Badasti: lmao
[0:31:57] LubD5: @ImPlutooo Probably Disco Priest might be good pick, or HPal.
[0:31:58] nameyourform: LOL
[0:31:58] zachgamegodx: fury is going to be terrible
[0:32:01] Dimistarr: solid first round
[0:32:03] Erissgoddes: @venruki Trillebartom is playing  2s 1vs2 by alt tabbing you gotta see this :D
[0:32:03] cubsthemonk: 2k lobby btw
[0:32:04] zachgamegodx: it's already arguably the worst dps we got
[0:32:16] Dimistarr: meta
[0:32:18] WhereMaldo: imo aura,dash, imo aura, felblade, retreat, cancel with meta, fel barrage, hunt, Elysian deceee, essence break, blade dance
[0:32:20] simstarx: glimpse the root!
[0:32:21] Badasti: thats a novel idea
[0:32:23] Ambersulfr: ideally you'd get a root dispel
[0:32:25] Adessius: good morning Ven
[0:32:27] snakesandfoxes: root is literally the only weakness of dh
[0:32:33] smoothytoothy: kill them before they kill your team
[0:32:34] WhereMaldo: I did it I remembered
[0:32:35] nightmxz: I feel like WW was an insane winner for the changes too
[0:32:57] KaptinKazual: @venruki If you have A Fire Insdie, and use the cleansing flame, you can remove MOST roots and snares.  Just don't use it against AffLock or Spriest.
[0:32:59] zachgamegodx: @nightmxz wdym, it's a burst class
[0:33:01] snakesandfoxes: you need to essb before you sweep
[0:33:02] zachgamegodx: that only does physical
[0:33:05] snakesandfoxes: You're missing all of your damage
[0:33:06] zachgamegodx: ww definitely didnt win lol
[0:33:18] reedthesham: Fel barrage still popular talent I think
[0:33:24] Shezzmou: i do love a good eyebeam
[0:33:25] zachgamegodx: DH won
[0:33:28] zachgamegodx: of the melee
[0:33:30] reedthesham: But still essence break is main
[0:33:30] nightmxz: @zachgamegodx hits plate harder and it will still 1-shot cloth, won't get 1-shot by rogues anymore and it's consistent damage not burst lmfao
[0:33:31] JmanOwnz: lol redpigo and porkahontas on your team
[0:33:36] Ambersulfr: this rdruid is struggling
[0:33:50] rekt1370: any melee cleave with a dk is the struggle for a healer
[0:33:59] shoeloopz: no idea whaat i am doing - top dps DH
[0:34:00] zachgamegodx: @nightmxz good people cc a ww, your consistient dmg means nothing, it's what you can do with 5 seconds of uptime
[0:34:05] wackpoetic: good morning friends
[0:34:07] WhereMaldo: here’s what you do venny boi… imo aura,dash, imo aura, dash, felblade, retreat, cancel with meta, fel barrage, hunt, Elysian deceee, essence break, blade dance
[0:34:10] Shezzmou: misery the healer
[0:34:29] Shezzmou: yeah you almost had em
[0:34:37] nightmxz: @zachgamegodx Then everything is bad because you can CC it, fried take lol
[0:34:39] Axtin: dh honor talents are insane
[0:34:49] pyqmi: Evenings Venruki !
[0:35:08] zachgamegodx: night, you argue things so aggressively. all i can say is that people who main the spec think it's a nerf and their reasons are solid
[0:35:12] wackpoetic: Yu'lon's Grace on WW is actually OP into DH
[0:35:38] Shezzmou: god the new look of fealine stomp is awful
[0:35:41] SlogreTheOgre: oh no its illidangodx time :O
[0:35:41] wackpoetic: I've been taking the passive defensives on WW lately and I swear Yu'lon's absorb is as much as Karma some games
[0:35:52] nightmxz: @zachgamegodx Not really, and I disagree with them :)
[0:36:05] ImJordanHi: @Shezzmou They also changed the druid ability adaptive swarm too I think
[0:36:12] wackpoetic: Shezzmou how could you possibly think this
[0:36:22] pyqmi: Toughts about recent spell school changes. aff / arcane mainly.
[0:36:36] Shezzmou: it's like an ugly ass green snake thing now
[0:36:41] Fayce123: He's insane w/ it Pog
[0:36:47] Shezzmou: it used to be a cool looking line
[0:36:48] novaspectv: that healer hated life
[0:37:03] SlogreTheOgre: DH going right to the top PogChamp
[0:37:04] JokeHoleToilet: how long have you had a DH lol
[0:37:32] tv_raz: pally already bubbd
[0:37:33] tv_raz: ooof
[0:38:16] l1ght_c0re: I'm new to DH is Elysian Decree bad? what have you selected over it?
[0:38:19] ferahgok: shove it all. big dam
[0:38:46] bmanflex: you wanna save essence break for eye break
[0:38:54] bmanflex: eye beam into essence break
[0:38:55] Shezzmou: just use it quick so you can win with the second one
[0:38:57] bmanflex: every go for max dam
[0:39:08] Outer_Limitz: this poor druid lol
[0:39:20] bmanflex: then you wanna choas strike and death sweep after getting essence breakl off
[0:39:31] wackpoetic: DH = queue pop, time to win
[0:39:35] zinisterzz: you should essence break before blade dance I believe as it buffs it
[0:39:52] rekt1370: eye beam essence break death sweep
[0:39:54] rekt1370: biggest dam of life
[0:40:01] zinisterzz: yea what rekt said
[0:40:06] Stealthgam3r: druid innervating 1st global lol
[0:40:16] wackpoetic: I think optimally you want eye beam, blade dance, metamorphasis, hunt, eye beam, essence break, blade dance?
[0:40:45] WhereMaldo: I sent the full burst rotation xD just spend like an hour learning it on a dummy
[0:40:48] rekt1370: biggest thing you want is to be in meta essence break and death sweep thats your biggest damage
[0:40:50] rekt1370: can hunt after
[0:40:50] zinisterzz: i mean yea but i olny put it becuase he was reversing essence break and blade dance
[0:40:59] Cuhrismuh: I like to try and line them up so they all get hunt dot

[0:42:32] Deevo_Twitch: do you play any classic? or your just strictly retail guy?
[0:42:37] Saiyori: dh is stupid fun once you get the hang of it

[0:45:00] SlogreTheOgre: Warlock SZN
[0:45:04] zachgamegodx: i think assa arcane will still be great
[0:45:05] Deevo_Twitch: @venruki have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
[0:45:16] pyqmi: sounded bit aggressive with that sorry. i mean eventually its bound to happen. What i meant is that is dh fun to play even if would be "shit" spec
[0:45:17] zachgamegodx: i need to do some testing on the threshold for fear breaks and root breaks from various things
[0:45:18] lowtherr: those ret changes look like a typo they shoulda been marked for non pvp hahaha
[0:45:29] QuonDot: I got pulled over going 110 in a 65, and got a warning LUL
[0:45:36] Sosatko: when is dh a shit spec
[0:45:38] Sosatko: LOL
[0:45:43] ferahgok: photo radar is soooo garbage. Big Brother 1984 type stuff
[0:45:46] zachgamegodx: most specs are subject to tuning, very few specs are immune to nerfs
[0:45:51] DrewPBallz18: lets run some resto druid dh too get u gear
[0:45:58] thepartyzone: just watched the YouTube video, your comment section is cooked lol. i think the changes are good armor only affects like 3 classes damage. ret and dh guna be giga juiced
[0:46:02] zachgamegodx: and they got a couple cops watching that area
[0:46:14] beedl0: Jjust noticed the other day that in NA solo shuffle for frost mage 7 out of top 10 are the same guy… do you think it’s healthy for the game and if not, can blizzard do anything about it?
[0:46:23] ImJordanHi: Is that legal? lol wtf
[0:46:25] StillDray: They aren't allowed to do that where I live now, it is nice
[0:46:30] pyqmi: Same thing in Finland with speed "trap zones"
[0:46:43] kusoneko: 30% more armor = 30% less damage taken 4Head
[0:46:57] pyqmi: also hidden speed cars. they park vans on side of road witch actually are speed cameras : D
[0:47:04] lowtherr: Ven RET and DH is gnna be crazy hahah
[0:47:07] lowtherr: Or Ret demo
[0:47:11] thepartyzone: lol yea that’s really what people think @kusoneko
[0:47:25] Badasti: only thing they need to fix re. rating is inflation / deflation. Imo skill level should be near enough static, not based on the time of the season
[0:47:29] TheBAMSportsShow: hey buddy, happy saturday!
[0:47:36] thepartyzone: ret dh is juiced
[0:47:40] thepartyzone: with these changes
[0:47:52] acronymeu: does the ww nerf do anything? @venruki
[0:47:55] thepartyzone: afflic assas and ret dh are going to be s tier comps
[0:47:57] TheBAMSportsShow: we had a late show so late morning for me haha
[0:48:15] QuonDot: Nah people are crazy
[0:48:26] Shezzmou: oh i'm crazy but i'm the happy kinda crazy
[0:48:26] lowtherr: ven is a confirmed pychopath

[0:48:29] pyqmi: 4chan gonna figure out ur address from this information
[0:48:30] Badasti: ima stand outside Ven's house with a boom box
[0:48:32] SlogreTheOgre: Wow venruki you didnt want me coming over? :(
[0:48:40] SlogreTheOgre: lol
[0:48:59] TheBAMSportsShow: its not you its me
[0:49:02] Outer_Limitz: Its me :)
[0:49:07] tv_raz: its not me its you
[0:49:13] Saiyori: gotta stay safe
[0:49:27] SlogreTheOgre: Yea makes sense man
[0:49:28] Luigicamp: if it's anything like that msg that guy left you in game last week, I understand
[0:49:30] What_ln_Tarnation: its wild to me how asmongold who has like 50k viewers streams his house all the time
[0:49:34] thepartyzone: Mes had a good take last night @venruki the armor may have been nerfed but because of the Hp buff it will make facing casters as a plate feel better
[0:49:37] Badasti: imagine all those irate ret paladins knowing your house address
[0:49:42] QuonDot: If ur not gonna give us the address, at least give us the social Kappa
[0:49:51] Badasti: after getting them all nerfed like that
[0:49:51] ImJordanHi: I feel like if people were required to act out the craziness in real life they wouldnt do it, but being 5000 miles away and getting SWATTED is...really dumb
[0:50:20] Axtin: everyone gets the stam buff tho
[0:50:28] What_ln_Tarnation: how does more hp for everyone make plate better into casters?
[0:50:32] Axtin: @Badasti
[0:50:44] Axtin: oops i mean @thepartyzone
[0:51:13] lowtherr: holy dam
[0:51:13] Badasti: damn, thought someone was speaking to me, there goes that dopamine
[0:51:15] lowtherr: jesus christ
[0:51:25] stoop_kid69: do you feel proud of what you did
[0:51:35] Axtin: @Badasti LUL
[0:51:38] Bugenheim: @badasti hi
[0:51:53] justaguy34921: he was an enh shaman, he was asking for punishment
[0:51:57] Badasti: @Bugenheim <3
[0:52:07] Zumaji: @venruki have you ever thought about like vlogging your hikes in your area. I get the privacy thing though I wouldn’t share any info with all these DH players 😂
[0:52:10] wowsuomi: That guys waiting for that irl tour now
[0:52:10] What_ln_Tarnation: gotteeeeeem
[0:52:21] thepartyzone: sorry stepped away, had to do with like dk shell scales off hp, and it’s longer you can stay in the fight against them.
[0:53:03] Genruto: theres a cave entrence in the forest for the victim wq
[0:53:04] Badasti: makes sense to me, turns it into a chore
[0:53:12] pyqmi: makes sense
[0:53:25] ImJordanHi: Being out in the mountains, away from technology...except not LUL
[0:53:32] 인터넷포트: The Havok Demon Hunter is a Fel Dookie Speculization of Magic and Damage is Does Very GOOD Damages and Can Heal Many Times with its passive Leech as dookie does Damage dookie Heals himself to stay alive in PvP arena setting. Its Demonform makes it damage upting good and healing strong during burst phase.
[0:53:41] thepartyzone: ret dh will be the most anti caster comp especially since ret buffs out weigh the hp gain
[0:53:45] wackpoetic: just strap a gopro to your head and call it a day
[0:53:50] Zumaji: @venruki I know you used to, I get that makes perfect sense I don’t even like my phone on me when I hike. I used to watch them I was living through you haha planned a trip to hike in Alberta until we found out we were having our first kiddo
[0:53:58] Axtin: no chance
[0:54:00] thepartyzone: yes
[0:54:08] Axtin: dh/dk better into casters
[0:54:15] lowtherr: dh dk better into casters forsure
[0:54:16] Axtin: friendly ams talent is insane too
[0:54:19] kusoneko: KEKW
[0:54:22] calaim: ven, what are you opinions on rdruid vs mw monk? either one "easier" to break into?
[0:54:25] phanabananana: dh will still be better in any comp that rets good into just replace the ret with a dk
[0:54:25] thepartyzone: dh damage still good but now ret damage is even better. and ret has better utility
[0:54:39] thepartyzone: dk**
[0:54:56] MrFuzzynuts420: is the boomkin nerfs gonna be bad?
[0:55:12] Badasti: hope so
[0:55:13] lfkappachupa: !commands
[0:55:13] Nightbot: @lfkappachupa -> The bot commands for this channel are available at https://nightbot.tv/t/venruki/commands

[0:56:08] Chillatech: top o tha mornin
[0:56:08] What_ln_Tarnation: its wild to me they buffed lock armor even more
[0:56:23] Badasti: it drives me nuts
[0:56:26] mayonaes: lets just go ahead and malke it to when a boomkin cast a spell there is a chance they turn into a chicken and take 500% extra damage
[0:56:34] Outer_Limitz: is there anything else like that?
[0:56:44] timmah25: I mean at least they cant shape shift out of it anymore when you do land one in caster form
[0:56:44] Axtin: do u think thats factored into the rest of their kit
[0:56:45] SlogreTheOgre: We know, we just hate mages more SMOrc
[0:56:52] dmicrl: remember when they were just trees literally all game? the worst
[0:56:52] gracioussatan: it’s bullshit for rdruid especially
[0:57:04] leeka: they should just make mages immune to cyclone to make up for it lol
[0:57:04] calaim: yeah but you could banish a tree-druid
[0:57:05] Chillatech: good good.
[0:57:09] Badasti: @Outer_Limitz there are fear immunities in the game, but passives just for existing
[0:57:15] Badasti: not passives*
[0:57:20] Axtin: idk its a weird thing to think about
[0:57:25] mayonaes: No SP buffs :(
[0:57:27] Axtin: if i could suddenly be polyd
[0:57:31] Axtin: idk how bad it would be
[0:57:36] wackpoetic: mayonaes SP got lots of buffs?
[0:57:42] mayonaes: not for pvp
[0:57:46] subarUWUw: hi ven thanks for streaming
[0:57:53] marutheoak: Hello everyone
[0:58:07] Badasti: itd make a big diff, atm there's not much I can do about incarn if DB / Ring is on CD
[0:58:10] nightmxz: I just want devoker to have poly dr for sleep walk instead of fear dr
[0:58:12] wackpoetic: mayonaes they got armor buff and damage buff both effective in pvp
[0:58:17] Badasti: and balance is better at peaking and doing dam than i am on my mage
[0:58:24] VetisBR: i mean you get 2100 on everything you play. you are insane at the game. i do the same thing but at 1800 rofl
[0:58:27] Aypex01: hittin up the CEO?
[0:58:30] mayonaes: @wackpoetic ahh yess i see now ty
[0:58:46] Axtin: you could kind of say every class has some kind of grandfathered mechanic
[0:59:05] Axtin: ya its a good one
[0:59:13] yesterday_potato: Top of the morning Ven!
[0:59:16] nightmxz: @Axtin delete blink stun too, fk it :)
[0:59:17] Axtin: ok like rogues being able to sap people
[0:59:21] Axtin: without coming out of stealth
[0:59:22] Tamales888: starting next week what do you think would be easiest to get to 2100 on out of DK, WW, or SP ?
[0:59:24] SlogreTheOgre: I just wanna know why powershifting got the axe but being immune to the wizard class made it
[0:59:37] DrewPBallz18: dk
[0:59:42] Shezzmou: dk by a mile

[1:00:29] Badasti: im fine ith it if they give us some other way to play into rogue comps
[1:00:32] NozakGaming: the only time you play blink stun is into sub rogue right?
[1:00:35] wackpoetic: I feel like WW is going to farm DK lobbies but get farmed harder by like Destro/Arcane
[1:00:45] DrewPBallz18: people are saying in lfg 1900 isnt high enough
[1:01:10] dmicrl: double blink is way more fun anyway
[1:01:13] nightmxz: blink stun isn't fun at all
[1:01:20] SlogreTheOgre: How is Dev Evoker guys? Im coming off my SoD binge need a new caster :D Evokers the only one i havent tried yet

[1:02:22] rembrandt89: not looking forward to warlocks getting more tanky at all
[1:02:27] nightmxz: I was thinking rsham survival ret might be the counter to casters with all the changes, not sure about it though
[1:02:37] mashyret: wake of ashes is gonna hit like a truck now, both of the modifier talents for wake of ashes are buffed which means wake is hitting for around 80% more overall
[1:02:47] mashyret: ret hunter's BEEN back haha
[1:02:47] animeloverover9o0o: sub is still the best ank with 10 30% shield /heals not kidding 8 30ish% heals 2 30 % shields sub rog

[1:03:43] leeka: "Dragonflight Gladius (Bicmex Version)"
[1:03:46] ferahgok: stam buff across the board might help living against sub buffs a bit
[1:03:49] DrewPBallz18: my healer left me in lfg and i look at jellybeans stream and there running 2's
[1:03:55] ferahgok: not sub buffs. but sub in general

[1:04:35] DrewPBallz18: y does no one wanna play with the rouge
[1:04:40] Zilesky: sucks they made it so icant convert tokens to blizz balance anymore on wrath
[1:04:45] ItsBees: Pet battles Pog
[1:04:47] hooqs: @Saitistreamy wotlk tokens cant convert to bnet balance
[1:05:10] rembrandt89: I don’t think they should of nerfed damage when they buffed stam an armor before seeing the pacing of games
[1:05:21] animeloverover9o0o: how do you start pet stuff i go to org or sw noquest on new toon?

[1:06:45] Shezzmou: 1400 SS is hell though lol
[1:06:50] reedthesham: if they look at the general population, then why no enhance changes tbh.. they are underplayed :(
[1:06:59] Adessius: TRUE
[1:07:02] Arubicon: Morning Ven
[1:07:05] marutheoak: changes are ment to not having rogue in every team KEK
[1:07:08] nightmxz: I'll have to see the pacing before I give my final opinion, but looking at them I think I like them
[1:07:12] anacronz: cause we go him
[1:07:14] Shezzmou: @reedthesham no one wants to be a caster Enh bruh

[1:09:49] nicoros61: Can I complain as a destro in a shuffle with 2x DH + BM hunter?
[1:09:57] gracioussatan: rogues in 2s especially play like scum bags lol
[1:09:59] Nachofez: rogues are the absolute worst
[1:10:04] danimal513: dampening over 50% should start increasing stealth detection
[1:10:10] hays4dayz: did you see the DH diversify UI videos? wild UI from JohelTV😂

[1:36:58] DevobotOCE: @ItsBees yea all the old alts that haven't changed hearth xd
[1:37:02] ItsBees: LUL
[1:37:07] rethumtv: pretty crazy changes coming next week
[1:37:16] tarth_100: Ven, do you think aff locks will be able to take essence drain over impish to just compound on their tankyness?
[1:37:17] Aypex01: whats the dh burst combo?
[1:37:17] diperna99: do you think feral will be any good?
[1:37:19] Chillatech: @venruki for ww monk and frost mage, should i be playing back more in 3's
[1:37:21] DrewPBallz18: my mage friend said your better than xaryu at mage is this true
[1:37:24] rembrandt89: vers mas boots or the pvp boots?
[1:37:25] Chillatech: feel like i always get trained
[1:37:27] DevobotOCE: are they buffing hpriest just so its more competitive with disc, cause it's not bad at all.. so i'm surprised with the buffs
[1:37:35] Shezzmou: you should do fistweaver 2s on DH people will hate you so much
[1:37:35] ItsBees: yes
[1:37:39] crazzbez: i appreciate the indirect mage buffs that stop hunter from cleaving you to fuck
[1:37:47] Typhoid: did xaryu go to blizzcon?
[1:37:47] simstarx: @DrewPBallz18 xaryu is an actor nowadays
[1:37:54] renae69: its crazy how the meta has evolved so much that ppl look at patch notes to decide what to play
[1:37:56] kusoneko: xaryu is a classic gamer dad now
[1:37:56] MrFuzzynuts420: i mean xaryu doesn't pvp anymore
[1:38:01] What_ln_Tarnation: xaryu would def be rusty in retail, vote goes to ven
[1:38:24] ItsBees: it's fun to see the one shot video on the front page of Drustvar Pog
[1:38:27] Typhoid: xar is cringe
[1:38:34] Typhoid: he is like the andrew shulz of wow
[1:38:35] DrewPBallz18: i try to play mage but its really hard for me
[1:38:35] crazzbez: do you play in the middle when its double dps training you
[1:38:52] ItsBees: The only boomy change I want is for them to get rid of Eclipse Sadge
[1:39:07] flyingorangee: @Typhoid Weirdge
[1:39:08] stepdaddayy: Xar is a goat
[1:39:12] What_ln_Tarnation: xaryu has that beverly hills mansion $$ now
[1:39:13] Typhoid: NO No NO whyyyyy- xaryu every vid thats all
[1:39:16] DevobotOCE: Xar is just a business man dude, classic is working for him and his community so he pursued it, idk why ppl hate on him for it
[1:39:20] Typhoid: game play is solid lol
[1:39:23] beardedwizard9: ok ok its a xar safespace but what about ven can we talk shit about him?
[1:39:37] DevobotOCE: yea that's what I mean
[1:39:38] taylorperiod: LOL
[1:39:38] DrewPBallz18: your music playlist is fire
[1:39:42] Taevenx: @ItsBees can they get rid of hitting me with 285k moons?
[1:39:52] DevobotOCE: classic is clearly working out for him so, good on him for keeping at it
[1:39:53] abolick88: i used to watch xar but don't anymore because i only play retail
[1:39:55] kusoneko: getting the money while the moneys hot
[1:39:57] nikthevoker: theyre jealous mostly same thing
[1:39:58] What_ln_Tarnation: im guessing xaryu is the top wow only streamer money maker
[1:40:01] ItsBees: @Taevenx no
[1:40:09] eceria: Xaryu logged in Retail yesterday and all chat were fuming, he logged back to Classic Immidiatly
[1:40:15] Badasti: I live Xaryu as a person but never my fav streamer to watch. Mostly because he's too twitchy when he plays and it's exhausting to watch :P
[1:40:19] DevobotOCE: + Xar is ripped, what's not to love
[1:40:28] Taevenx: I'm ready for it, the caster meta gonna go strongggggg
[1:40:37] wreklol: ven what's your opinion on arcane's 4 set?
[1:40:39] renae69: it must be so boring being forced into playing classic every day
[1:40:40] Typhoid: i thought mitch jones was making the most and spending the most
[1:40:47] zachgamegodx: OK @venruki I did some testing, Frost Nova will break when the target takes 7.3% of their HP in dmg, so I guess Nova will require 14.6% on Tuesday
[1:40:53] QuonDot: Im sure Xar misses retail too
[1:40:53] What_ln_Tarnation: @DevobotOCE hes also very small so you can carry him around in your pocket
[1:40:54] freelofear: splay is already insane, and its getting buffed
[1:40:55] zachgamegodx: I'll test some other roots
[1:40:57] DevobotOCE: do you think the hpriest changes will make them all swap
[1:41:00] Shezzmou: my only worry is Demo because it's damp king
[1:41:06] buffnac: ret dh and ele dh are gonna be insane
[1:41:10] Sosatko: Dh dk
[1:41:18] Taevenx: dam is good for Ret, but could have used a little off heals
[1:41:24] Xeliumimar: FDK/Dev, do their go and run circles around the pillar for a minute
[1:41:30] Badasti: I think thundercleave is strong into wizard  cleaves as well
[1:41:34] Sosatko: yeah ret needed more xd
[1:41:37] What_ln_Tarnation: people sleeping on that 20% dam buff rshams got
[1:41:44] DevobotOCE: i hate the whole dps off heal scenario
[1:41:47] Typhoid: 20% non crit
[1:41:48] ATHLTE: thunder can feel rough as splay
[1:41:50] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to venruki's community! 
[1:41:50] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to kashmoney31!  
[1:41:53] Typhoid: the lava burst gonna crack on flame shocks
[1:41:54] Taevenx: I don't need to top, but being beaten passively by DH, War and DK hurts a little
[1:41:57] DevobotOCE: remember back when SP, Enhance, Ret would just dominate 2s lobbies bc of the crazy off healing
[1:41:58] DevobotOCE: no thanks
[1:42:00] zachgamegodx: dou think that's gonna be good for frost or inconsequential
[1:42:19] gracioussatan: you can just heal instead of final verdict
[1:42:20] doclovejr: i saw Whaaz  queuing into affliction/assass rogue yesterday and it was kinda nutty how much pressure the lock/rogue put out
[1:42:22] tarth_100: ret has a low cd shield and wall and 3 immunities
[1:42:30] Genruto: whaazzz was dominating shuffles with assa yesterday... assa meta now?
[1:42:46] What_ln_Tarnation: mitigation from sac and bop
[1:42:51] Typhoid: assa not fighting evoker is god mode
[1:42:54] Taevenx: @tarth_100 something tells me you don't play ret lol
[1:42:58] DutchmasterDyl: sac is dog
[1:43:01] Typhoid: dwarf and evoker counters assa meta
[1:43:03] Arubicon: leech is good
[1:43:05] Dues: Ret wall is 20% lol
[1:43:06] happyheals: and damage avoided because of freedom
[1:43:14] happyheals: bop
[1:43:16] What_ln_Tarnation: @DutchmasterDyl ???? literally one of the best CDs for pvp
[1:43:20] tarth_100: Vengeance shield, wall, divine shield, bop, magic bop..?
[1:43:21] Shezzmou: you can just pump leech and it's good
[1:43:31] zachgamegodx: ur healers couldnt send u some conquest tickets?
[1:43:44] Arubicon: on green gear id maybe do avoidance if ya taking a shit pile of damage and put leech on the purps
[1:43:47] Typhoid: get a mythci cruel dreamcarver and carvea  beast
[1:43:54] gracioussatan: I could see removing forbearance or reducing it
[1:43:56] What_ln_Tarnation: 1400 players not realizing sac makes you immune to a bunch of CC at the same time
[1:43:56] Typhoid: extra 10% leech below 50% health lol

[1:44:06] DrewPBallz18: its happening to me
[1:44:13] Caszatic: @venruki do you think its weird that evokers can dragonfly accross the whole world but they cant verdant embrace a player greater than 25-30yd away
[1:44:14] Taevenx: @gracioussatan would be great for SS lobbies with Ret/Holy
[1:44:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Time to get DH nerfed!
[1:44:20] ATHLTE: hype for uncapped conquest
[1:44:34] zachgamegodx: the frost bite talent will be affected by the root talent ye?
[1:44:38] zachgamegodx: the root buff
[1:44:49] crazzbez: LOL
[1:44:52] Caszatic: @venruki lol locks can
[1:44:52] DrewPBallz18: LMFAO
[1:44:53] EliteDamit: It's called game design bruthaaa
[1:44:53] happyheals: no medal of conquest from unopened healer call to arms boxes?
[1:44:59] Shezzmou: Ret getting huge buffs and complaining. Yet Enh get absolutely nothing.
[1:45:01] Typhoid: lore accurate
[1:45:04] Caszatic: @venruki class fantasy at its finest
[1:45:05] rembrandt89: what are your awc predictions
[1:45:10] kusoneko: ven for lead class design
[1:45:16] What_ln_Tarnation: why can my WW literally 1 shot deathwing but not a player?
[1:45:16] Typhoid: rogue frost mage
[1:45:19] Typhoid: gonna be awc
[1:45:27] malvarcla: as a mage why cant I just port them on the sun and kill them instantly
[1:45:49] Taevenx: @Shezzmou who's complaining? more people complaining about the other PvP stuff
[1:45:55] FoxisFitness: Ret getting around 6.5% dmg buff and -30% armor. Calm down people lol
[1:45:56] Typhoid: no you need to cc more
[1:45:58] Typhoid: lol
[1:46:02] Typhoid: skill capped told me
[1:46:19] Shezzmou: @Taevenx how long you been in chat? lol Rets complaining about everything everyday.
[1:46:30] happyheals: Skill capped told me that I should consider playing solitaire instead
[1:47:03] Taevenx: @Shezzmou not sure that's accurate, but go off
[1:47:11] Arubicon: you have fel eruption?
[1:47:27] SlogreTheOgre: Ret players complain-> overturned-> game loses all its pvp pop due to ret meta-> ret nerfed back to C tier. Rinse repeat two-three times an xpac :D
[1:47:41] Bugenheim: I sometimes wonder what the average mmr of chat is. There are some wild opinions flying around lol.
[1:48:18] FoxisFitness: @SlogreTheOgre More people played during Ret meta than caster meta.

[1:49:30] Shezzmou: you're weird but okay. Have a nice day lol
[1:49:51] SlogreTheOgre: Evoker made that look easy PogChamp
[1:50:01] tarth_100: I think some amount of damage buff made sense for ret, just don't think they need more defensive stuff

[1:51:22] malvarcla: rets should be able to cast divine shield onto a team mate as well just like bop
[1:51:24] rembrandt89: did ret get a defensive buff too?

[1:52:44] rekt1370: ret is the worst melee
[1:53:07] tarth_100: ret is the kil target because if you don't go them, they make it so that their team mate is immortal
[1:53:18] rekt1370: ret also dies pretty easy
[1:53:21] SlogreTheOgre: @rekt1370 Worse than enh?
[1:53:23] massiveshade: ret has so much protection for their friends
[1:53:23] SlogreTheOgre: Idk
[1:53:30] Shezzmou: worse than frost dk too apparently
[1:53:33] rekt1370: enhance might be close to ret but enhance has way bigger burst
[1:53:37] Dues: Warrior can save teammates just as much
[1:53:50] Dues: Does more dmg and has MS
[1:53:51] rekt1370: ret brings nothing good lol
[1:54:03] rekt1370: frost dk has good setups cc
[1:54:11] rekt1370: enhance good vs casters
[1:54:15] SlogreTheOgre: Ret has an insane kit wym brings nothing
[1:54:17] Taevenx: @rekt1370 this is false
[1:54:23] tarth_100: sac, sanc, bop, freedom how is that nothing?
[1:54:30] Shezzmou: @rekt1370 you legit think Ret is worse than Enh and Frost dk? hahahahahahahahahahahaha
[1:54:32] rekt1370: bop freedom purge spell steal
[1:54:37] SlogreTheOgre: Rets kit is pretty top tier lol. Its just theyre undertuned
[1:54:39] savyverse: loh
[1:54:40] rekt1370: sanc and sac is good sure
[1:54:42] rekt1370: nothing for you tho

[1:55:15] rekt1370: wall shield

[1:55:30] yesterday_potato: rets after patch this is there song
[1:55:37] rekt1370: shield legit gets affected by damp
[1:55:40] abolick88: pop meta
[1:55:47] malvarcla: @rekt1370 no way you are serious
[1:55:49] savyverse: do a back flip
[1:55:50] tarth_100: sanc can be used for you techincally, and saving your healer from cc might as well be like giving yourself an extra wall
[1:55:58] ItsBees: so many wings Pog
[1:56:02] rekt1370: ret is bottom tier melee down there with frost and enhance lol
[1:56:07] nikthevoker: DHs own evokers
[1:56:08] SlogreTheOgre: Idk man i dont think rets kit is its weakness. I just think its undertuned
[1:56:56] gdodmebxu: Try not to complain as a ret main challenge (impossible)
[1:57:33] SlogreTheOgre: lol i dont think all ret players complain. I just think a lot of people play paladin so even if only 5% complain it comes off as a lot
[1:57:37] Shezzmou: i swear some Rets complained even when they were 70% of the ladder
[1:57:37] Taevenx: @gdodmebxu the ones who complain the most don't see above 1800 (most rets) lol
[1:57:53] Bugenheim: $$$
[1:58:13] Gotheels: he says hmmmm lol
[1:58:29] nikthevoker: rets need buffs, they cant catch any ranged!
[1:58:38] SlogreTheOgre: Dont wake up the ret players from their mid day naps by mentioning them monkaS
[1:58:47] rekt1370: rets in their wheelchairs

[2:01:13] Taevenx: ez pointos
[2:01:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: 96 rating is alright
[2:01:45] sxxicute: meta is 2min cd, so often you’ll get off two metas no?
[2:01:51] JustSmilex: How is shadow priest currently ven?
[2:01:59] MrFuzzynuts420: you gonna be doing solo rbgs when they comes out?
[2:01:59] zachgamegodx: i hate how you have to defend yourself when you learn new things
[2:02:10] rethumtv: mostly just haste
[2:02:10] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got MASSIVE 10.2.5 Class Tuning & PvP Changes" view it here: youtu.be/LFKMv81If4A
[2:02:31] What_ln_Tarnation: meta also good for mobility and to immune damage/cc
[2:02:35] Paybacks: are you playing the meta eye beam reset?
[2:03:28] pmakewow: hi ven
[2:03:28] Carltonftw: hey ven are you having weird bugs with gladius also?
[2:03:31] pmakewow: AWC HYPE AWC HYPE
[2:03:46] pmakewow: yes woowoo wowoo woohoooo
[2:03:49] pmakewow: changes were good
[2:03:55] sxxicute: u want to meta about first global, so u can get off a second one. but im not gonna sit here and pretend im a dh god! have fun and figure out what works for u, thats the whole fun of playing a new class
[2:03:58] rethumtv: @Carltonftw my gladius is also weird, it seems to fix itself 90% of the time when gates open
[2:04:04] pmakewow: the changes are good for my team
[2:04:06] ImJordanHi: Do you think its bad if pro players chirp each other?
[2:04:15] likeewlock: why ppl go crazy about locks I mean 35% armor is like 4% physical reduction
[2:04:16] pmakewow: me shoxy berly adamrex
[2:04:19] pmakewow: its no secret
[2:04:23] pmakewow: everyone thought i was playing with kalvish lol
[2:04:23] TheBAMSportsShow: when is awc?
[2:04:27] zachgamegodx: the root change is concerning, if every frost bite sticks while you’re pummeling a target
[2:04:55] Shezzmou: fear takes more to break was an interesting change
[2:05:06] crazzbez: is frostbite the one with the 10% root chance
[2:05:17] mircaeye: good morning, do you have a boyfriend?
[2:05:19] justaguy34921: why do a lot of streamers have the same ability on their bar multiple times (not macros).  Like you have with blur, or are those macros?
[2:05:20] ImJordanHi: Mechanics that arent even that insane, but make you want to pull your hair out should be removed.
[2:05:24] zachgamegodx: let’s say frost bite breaks at 100k now requiring 200k is gonna be rather silly
[2:05:28] rembrandt89: fear hardly seems to ever break as is
[2:05:31] tarth_100: Can warriors just kill you in their fear now? I already felt like that one didn't break as easily as lock fear.
[2:05:42] Paybacks: thats not true, aff fearing its own dots sits for llike 1 global it feells like
[2:05:50] Badasti: Ven what do you think of my DH Mog https://imgur.com/a/L2Na0pi
[2:05:51] What_ln_Tarnation: its so weird how blizz can see locks and how good they are and be like "lets buff them more"
[2:05:52] ItsBees: LUL
[2:06:00] MrFuzzynuts420: KEKW
[2:06:01] ImJordanHi: LUL
[2:06:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: Ziqo PogBones
[2:06:09] ferahgok: lol
[2:06:09] Badasti: grew out my eyebrows
[2:06:31] shhquiettime: Question, Does the raid helm ench work in pvp, while hitting pvp dummy with WM on it does still proc
[2:06:31] dakotan517: what are warriors all rerolling, dh?
[2:06:33] shugguls: warriors got double nurfed by the armour nuf, there is a talent that gives us 10% str for armour, so we lose about 320 str
[2:06:36] reczy__: Did you broke up with supa?
[2:06:39] dakotan517: @shhquiettime yes
[2:06:50] reczy__: Break*
[2:06:51] ItsBees: It does not work in pvp
[2:07:02] nikthevoker: silken
[2:07:03] dakotan517: it 100% does
[2:07:04] zachgamegodx: @tarth_100 no, with the talent it takes about 174k dmg to break intim,
[2:07:16] yesterday_potato: what you using to see
[2:07:32] Hobblefoot: Morning! Anyone see the patch notes yet? Kidding!  One of my first thought was that the AWC matches were going to be real long.
[2:07:38] zachgamegodx: next  reset that’ll be 340 k I suppose
[2:07:39] ImJordanHi: Why does even tracking the order as a quest, still feel 15 years out dated...can you not just select a recipe and it populates all the mats you buy them all at once..
[2:07:48] zachgamegodx: they probably will nerf that talent
[2:07:54] tarth_100: @zachgamegodx is that now 174k? So will it be twice that with these changes?
[2:07:55] zachgamegodx: they just forgot
[2:08:01] shugguls: @Hobblefoot going to be demo outlaw again
[2:08:08] tarth_100: ah yea, sounds reasonable
[2:08:09] zachgamegodx: yeah now
[2:08:14] tarth_100: like that they just forgot
[2:08:34] shhquiettime: I hear conflicting, yes and no if it works in pvp
[2:08:38] zachgamegodx: i guess if you actually attack someone  with it it’s pretty toxic with the talent
[2:08:39] rwrbrickzy: are the priest buffs live rn?
[2:09:03] Hobblefoot: @shugguls Oh I agree. But I also see some Mage/Lock running a few marathons Cloud9 style.
[2:09:03] tarth_100: @zachgamegodx its like a pseudo stun if the limit is 340k. Intim shout fear into damage and then stormbolt when fear breaks lol
[2:09:07] ItsBees: @shhquiettime it doesn't
[2:09:12] happyheals: reset
[2:09:40] leeka: wizard + melee
[2:09:42] shhquiettime: @ItsBees ok was wondering if worth goin after it on pvp toons
[2:09:47] zachgamegodx: @tarth_100 yeah, but keep in mind most warriors don’t utilize that talent. probably will swap once ppl catch on
[2:09:48] shugguls: as i say outlaw demo
[2:09:52] MaybeRespect: I fight Splay alot at 2500 CR.
[2:09:54] burekodsira12: You think there is going to be a devoker in awc?
[2:09:57] rwrbrickzy: lol I’ve ran into sooooo many Arcane rmp with holy priest today
[2:09:59] nikthevoker: so you mean an outlaw or sub rogue
[2:09:59] Nerfmetodeath: it seems like all i q into is double wizard but maybe thats just cause they tilt m the most
[2:10:02] arcane_p: Hey Venruki will you be playing cata when it releases or nah?
[2:10:03] ItsBees: @shhquiettime it might work in world pvp but it 100% doesn't work in instanced pvp
[2:10:13] gdodmebxu: So just 1 victim class? rukiGrin
[2:10:21] shhquiettime: @ItsBees ok cool thanks
[2:10:27] zachgamegodx: it’s cause vens always qing double drag
[2:10:33] MaybeRespect: Double wiz, RMP, or lock/x is like 99% of my games
[2:10:44] happyheals: do they just not fight the o the other comps?
[2:10:48] zachgamegodx: 3 high powered disintegrates forcing every cd in the game
[2:10:49] rwrbrickzy: demo Ele, rmp and locks lotta locks
[2:10:55] happyheals: honor
[2:10:59] tarth_100: Have you run into the flightstone issue?
[2:11:00] ItsBees: next expansion Pog
[2:11:07] happyheals: get chests from the honor you send to alts]
[2:11:36] Aypex01: surely sp will be better after reset?
[2:12:28] arcane_p: If your a retail only player like myself is cataclysm fun I never played it? I heard your do get transmog that expansion which is nice
[2:12:34] Hobblefoot: @venruki But in your video you said yourself that Lock was going to be a tank. Frost Mage is stronger with the armor buff obviously.  I will say we always have these conversations and inevitably something surprises us.  Like ... dare I say double Outlaw again?  :P
[2:12:54] crazzbez: what's it gonna be
[2:12:58] arcane_p: ok good to know
[2:12:59] Boruox: Whats cata meta?
[2:13:00] Sosatko: Isnt cata when triple dps was real
[2:13:06] zachgamegodx: why are ppl so obsessed with the old game & classics
[2:13:08] diperna99: can you explain how to gear quickly for pvp
[2:13:08] QuonDot: eh indeed
[2:13:13] MaybeRespect: They may need to rethink warlock Impish Instincts talent now after armor buff.
[2:13:26] 3Brick_: !bf
[2:13:28] HoneyDutch: no surprise lock will be so tanky
[2:13:38] tarth_100: lock armor and health changes are pretty wild
[2:13:50] happyheals: it will for dh's and monks killing plate wearers
[2:13:53] Hobblefoot: Very true. My friend said the same thing about Shadow. He was very excited about the changes.
[2:13:57] nikthevoker: exactly what locks needed
[2:13:59] ImJordanHi: Does it bother you that the LuluLemon running shorts don't have pockets?
[2:14:03] tarth_100: not to mention the health buff for lock, bigger dark pact, more soul leach shield
[2:14:09] rembrandt89: plus darkpack
[2:14:30] jo4sho85: mes was saying the armor and health change was gonna slow the game down and that makes it a melle meta @venruki
[2:14:30] diperna99: can you explain how to gear quickly for pvp
[2:14:34] MaybeRespect: @tarth_100 This. Didn't even think of that
[2:14:34] zachgamegodx: * laughs in unravel while playing triple dragon*
[2:14:36] ImJordanHi: Yeah but the running shorts don't they have an inner layer with a little cellphone slot type of thing =(
[2:14:53] tarth_100: locks will def be juggernauts no doubt
[2:15:15] jo4sho85: dk needs a slow match
[2:15:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rets gonna run wild
[2:15:23] Elviiy: ret tho
[2:15:24] MaybeRespect: Ret DH maybe?
[2:15:25] ImJordanHi: Are you a Patagonia enjoyer?
[2:15:48] anmusallam: dk defensives will be better since they stack with health
[2:15:49] rembrandt89: rogue is like the only melee for slower games
[2:15:50] tarth_100: its fun when the meta gets shaken up tho, so im just gonna try and enjoy the ride
[2:15:51] zachgamegodx: dhs like strangulates and grips  not freedoms
[2:16:11] rekt1370: prices of everything is absurd rn LUL
[2:16:14] tarth_100: I just hope these Rdruid changes are enough
[2:16:20] zachgamegodx: how long does that gift card last you
[2:16:22] pvalue01: i like LLbean, a bit cheaper than patagonia but still decent quality
[2:16:23] drfeltgood: My wife just said the same thing about LULU
[2:16:23] zachgamegodx: multiple trips??
[2:16:25] rembrandt89: lulu has a lifetime warranty at least
[2:16:28] Aypex01: lulu is a ripoff. its sweat pants for fucks sake
[2:16:36] anmusallam: one??
[2:16:44] anmusallam: thats canadian right
[2:16:50] Hobblefoot: My kid likes that brand
[2:16:52] rekt1370: ridiculous
[2:16:56] wire_ghost: i shop their clearance stuff online. thats it
[2:17:01] zachgamegodx: i thought that was a ladies shop before you mentioned it
[2:17:05] wire_ghost: i got 3 things for 175
[2:17:07] klocksmith: i didnt realize they sold cocaine
[2:17:10] zachgamegodx: i didn’t know they did mens stuff
[2:17:12] ImJordanHi: Its not cheap, but its better than any other brand that does the same thing imo
[2:17:19] eyah: im a warrior do i reroll for the new patch
[2:17:25] ImJordanHi: You can find knock offs and stuff, but nothing compares fully 1/1
[2:17:39] Aypex01: LOL
[2:17:40] zachgamegodx: HAHA
[2:17:42] rekt1370: shadowplays boys
[2:17:44] anmusallam: i go to stores and get one thing for like ~60ish
[2:17:47] diperna99: Feral going to be good?
[2:17:48] drfeltgood: Does enhnce move up a tier?
[2:17:50] MaybeRespect: Everyone quick make a warlock!
[2:17:56] anmusallam: yeah im a dk but i feel bad for the warriors
[2:17:56] Biscuitboyusa: warlocks are the new warriors
[2:17:59] 인터넷포트: My grandpa taught me a lesson as a youngster it was to not shop at greedy bussinesses that be overcharging for dey shit
[2:18:05] rembrandt89: I have a friend that works for lulu and they get insane perks
[2:18:06] anmusallam: they will suffer so much
[2:18:07] klocksmith: i cant tell if that was sarcasm
[2:18:08] Lleo00: kind of a shame about wars, i dont feel like theyre that oppressive
[2:18:12] BogdanPavelDaniel: just because of the armor change?
[2:18:17] ImJordanHi: Have you thought about what you're cooking for dinner?

[2:18:49] MaybeRespect: @Intravz already does.
[2:18:51] KaptinKazual: Verdant Gladiator's Shotel look hot AF.. closest thing to 1H Sickle's that DH can use.
[2:19:02] rekt1370: resto sham biggest weakness is melee LUL
[2:19:08] 인터넷포트: To maket targetting the resto a thing
[2:19:10] tarth_100: I think its cuz of the mail / shield combo. Which begs tghe question why not elly too?
[2:19:13] 인터넷포트: they want us to hit the resto
[2:19:13] nikthevoker: i guess Rsham had big armor
[2:19:14] zachgamegodx: I think it’s cause they didn’t want shaman armor to be higher than plate right?
[2:19:14] anmusallam: they need to balance dark pact and leech next time
[2:19:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: Resto shaman was happy with lava burst going up 20%, then it was "Doh!" with that armor nerf for them
[2:19:26] ImJordanHi: Have you thought about what you're cooking for dinner?
[2:19:32] yesterday_potato: man hpal kinda got nerfed
[2:19:32] rekt1370: they would already not live long vs a melee cleave
[2:19:37] MaybeRespect: Does warlock have more armor than plate on tuesday? Lmao
[2:19:38] yesterday_potato: they not hard to kill as is
[2:19:48] zachgamegodx: melee cleaves that bother them most are dh dk
[2:19:58] tarth_100: Locks will have about the same armor as a mail class that doesn't use a shield.
[2:19:58] zachgamegodx: armor don’t do shit into that
[2:20:00] stepdaddayy: @yesterday_potato how so?
[2:20:12] anmusallam: im gonna make beef pasta tonight
[2:20:12] Shinigami797: You got this
[2:20:15] ImJordanHi: Maybe peanut butter and siracha sandwhich, you havent had one in ages
[2:20:19] yesterday_potato: @stepdaddayy armor nerf
[2:20:26] zachgamegodx: @tarth_100 should be about 24%
[2:20:33] zachgamegodx: reduction
[2:20:42] MaybeRespect: @yesterday_potato Yeah but prob will face mostly wizards so
[2:20:49] yesterday_potato: true
[2:21:07] zachgamegodx: frankly there’s not many meta spec that this affects aside from outlaw
[2:21:42] zachgamegodx: but outlaw was already way over the dmg threshold on cloth, the reduction to plate benefits them more than the buff to cloth
[2:22:01] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Well Demo lock does alot of phys dmg. So them into plate
[2:22:05] rekt1370: outlaw rogue was already s tier now they going to be omega giga god s tier
[2:22:49] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect I didn’t see demo as meta before tbh
[2:22:53] 인터넷포트: Does the hunt still make that like high pitch scream noise after they updated it green? I kinda liked that sound
[2:22:59] zachgamegodx: strong, yea, meta ? nah
[2:23:01] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx It will be now for sure.
[2:23:05] ImJordanHi: You're literally just Illidan all game....zipping around the map doing max DPS and nobody can stop you
[2:23:11] tarth_100: Why are people more worried bout Demo than destro?
[2:23:18] tarth_100: trying to figure out what im missing
[2:23:29] 인터넷포트: because u team sucks
[2:23:33] rekt1370: cause demo better with other casters
[2:23:34] snosiop: no stun?
[2:23:35] Taevenx: I think your rogue is broken
[2:23:44] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect depends on how good ele shaman ends up being with the nerfed Druid
[2:23:51] rekt1370: mage demo was already good same with s priest demo
[2:23:53] zachgamegodx: and sp
[2:23:53] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx It already was #5. With destro as 2. And the armor change is nutty for em
[2:23:57] rekt1370: now they got mega buffs
[2:23:57] Akselky: banger music
[2:24:05] anmusallam: @tarth_100 i think it might be because of the passive damage they deal with pets but i might be wrong
[2:24:05] zachgamegodx: #5 as in casters @mayberespect ? or
[2:24:13] MaybeRespect: yeah yeah.
[2:24:43] ImPlutooo: What class/role would you recommend to a completely new player?
[2:25:00] tarth_100: I just thought that currently destro was considered to edge out demo (not that demo is bad). Did demo's preferred partners become stronger or something with these changes is why..?
[2:25:19] rekt1370: destro can do more damage demo is way better in double caster
[2:25:33] zachgamegodx: keep in mind that Druid got nerfed and alot of these comps like LSD rely on the healing of the Druid to suceee
[2:25:34] rekt1370: you dont really play destro with another caster
[2:25:36] zachgamegodx: suceed
[2:25:49] tarth_100: true, but you don't really play double caster now either
[2:25:55] rekt1370: there is double caster
[2:26:04] Tim_Bmx_2017: wait ur not taking the sigil placement where it places at their feet
[2:26:06] rekt1370: mage lock s priest lock is strong before these changes
[2:26:09] MaybeRespect: @tarth_100 Uhh...that's like all i face bro
[2:26:16] zachgamegodx: it’s ok @havenblood his tier doesn’t it for him
[2:26:20] zachgamegodx: does
[2:26:26] itzshenny: who wins Na AWC this season
[2:26:33] rekt1370: anything with a rogue
[2:26:49] rekt1370: if cdew teams can beat kubzy rogue mage
[2:26:57] rekt1370: thats who if not kubzy rogue mage prob
[2:27:05] tarth_100: im not saying caster cleaves suck, im just saying from like the peak of the meta it seems caster/melee is where its at, Soj ust curious as to why people are scared about demo all of a sudden
[2:27:26] An0therTry: the ret pally fotms are back in full force
[2:27:26] itzshenny: whos kubzys rog?
[2:27:31] Taevenx: healer got RAN down
[2:27:38] snosiop: yeah DH bullies pallies
[2:27:41] Lleo00: hpal struggles
[2:27:47] MaybeRespect: So everyone saying boomy armor change is huge. But what does it only affects what, war WW outlaw?
[2:27:54] rembrandt89: @itzshenny dazed
[2:27:57] rekt1370: @tarth_100  demo already hard to kill and deal with when with another caster now they got giga buffs
[2:28:04] Taevenx: @An0therTry yeah, def as bad as S1
[2:28:31] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect like I said, outlaw gaining dmg on plate is more beneficial than losing dmg on cloth is negative
[2:28:37] zachgamegodx: net positive
[2:28:45] zachgamegodx: stam inc tho, probably not ideal
[2:28:49] MaybeRespect: Boomy is leather.
[2:28:53] rekt1370: yea the buffs were big outlaw buffs other melee nerfed other melee armor nerfed
[2:29:10] zachgamegodx: boomy got the plate treatment with boomy form nerf
[2:29:26] codyfeast: yo havnt tuned in a bit, but ven dude you be shredding out my boy
[2:29:47] MaybeRespect: Yeah. But it's only beneficial to like war and ww so not a huge deal @zachgamegodx ?
[2:30:02] Hobblefoot: @zachgamegodx 100% true about Outlaw.
[2:30:07] rekt1370: outlaw is all physical
[2:30:20] zachgamegodx: the changes aren’t a big deal yeah, it’s armor normalization and long over due
[2:30:28] rekt1370: best part about outlaw is their uptime too
[2:30:34] hiueeee: u excited for tuesday
[2:30:35] zachgamegodx: but the stam changes will shake up things
[2:30:37] SlogreTheOgre: Anyone know a streamer who plays outlaw? I suck so bad at it ngl
[2:30:48] zachgamegodx: whazz @slogretheogre
[2:30:49] rekt1370: kalvish plays outlaw
[2:31:09] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Hmm. It's a bit weird making cloth armor values as high as mail
[2:31:13] SlogreTheOgre: Thanks ven, ill look him up :)
[2:31:20] drfeltgood: Kalvish is outlaw master
[2:31:21] rembrandt89: kalvish plays a lot of outlaw
[2:31:29] rekt1370: kalvish prob best outlaw en
[2:31:31] rekt1370: rn
[2:31:32] artagore: @SlogreTheOgre Kalvish, Aeghis, whazz
[2:31:34] SlogreTheOgre: I do like half the dam im supposed to on Outlaw lmao. It just doesnt click with my brain the way sub/mut did
[2:31:38] rekt1370: na atleast
[2:31:45] SlogreTheOgre: Thanks chat, ill look em up
[2:32:05] dilsnick: such a good song
[2:32:43] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect they’re trying to make everything pretty similar to normalize physical dmg, giving a slight mitigation edge  to plate and slight mitigation disadvantage to the “clothies” (except warlock who will be more in the neutral category)
[2:32:43] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[2:33:26] anmusallam: youre farming bossman
[2:33:53] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx I know what they are doing. I just don't understand the philosophy. Plate are suppose to be jugg and slower, opposite for cloth
[2:33:55] ImPlutooo: What class would you recommend to a new WoW PvP player?
[2:34:06] Boruox: WOOOWWW
[2:34:10] zachgamegodx: you’ll still get your biggest crits on a spriest or mage as  a warrior and your lowest on another warrior or pally, that difference between those values will be more narrow which makes it easier to balance long term
[2:34:13] ebrithil357: HAHAHA
[2:34:32] HoneyDutch: didnt you get duled then hes was mc?
[2:34:39] Taevenx: typical ret, forgetting DPS can get sanc too
[2:34:54] anmusallam: you were robbed bro
[2:35:19] HoneyDutch: yeah he trolled
[2:35:19] fadedlolxd: couldve glimpsed CS too
[2:35:21] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect well that’s the thing, what you just said is the old fantasy and the way they’d been balancing it up to this point. but given that ret has a 20 yd range and warriors have 2 charges leap intervene etc it’s time to change things up
[2:35:26] Tridos_: I main DH, that sub opener on CC is almost always a trinket
[2:35:34] psychic241: well to b fair, ret was prob saving sanc for healer down the road
[2:35:38] acronymeu: anyone had any luck appealing a ban from toxic chat during shuffles?
[2:35:40] zachgamegodx: not ret, but you get the pt
[2:35:41] domoyega: aug no buffs again
[2:35:44] anmusallam: you got dueled too
[2:35:53] clicket: @domoyega thankfully
[2:35:55] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Yeah, I suppose my approach would be to reduce the zug not play into it.
[2:36:13] bwillyboy: ret couldve helped fs though but yea
[2:36:29] HoneyDutch: he did have time to sanc early but after that was nice cc from them out of duel
[2:36:30] Lidvo: !ui
[2:36:30] Nightbot: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfG0y7tGgzcwaaZOoaeZAyALulpHUaAHfH2wkaJ6pL0/edit?usp=sharing
[2:36:35] domoyega: I mean, we want all dps and heal specs to be viable
[2:36:42] Badasti: you set your expectations real low and you were still disappointed
[2:36:42] zachgamegodx: but then you’re being balanced around not playing the game, aka being cc’ed for 50% of it and trying to global someone @mayberespect
[2:36:58] Arubicon: weps
[2:37:03] syraxsis: wep
[2:37:03] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx No no. By reduce zug i'm also talking all the piss CC lol.
[2:37:04] DNCxbakoba: Wep better
[2:37:13] HoneyDutch: boots
[2:37:14] jamesip87: I think back on the warrior is better
[2:37:15] Arubicon: hell ya
[2:37:16] HoneyDutch: since ur have haste boots
[2:37:24] V0Xgrey: Depends whats ur mastery at
[2:37:27] gracioussatan: check stats I think boots will be better with missive for stats
[2:37:37] V0Xgrey: get boots
[2:37:49] Tridos_: My fully geared DH is 5500
[2:37:49] doo_dahh: whats mastery do again for DH? @venruki
[2:37:51] itzshenny: best NA Rogue?
[2:38:03] taylorperiod: kalvish
[2:38:06] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect ah yeah, well they reenforced the micro cc’s being a viable option with 10.1
[2:38:08] psychic241: does conq uncap this tuesday?
[2:38:22] Tridos_: Thats mastery on every item 5594
[2:38:26] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Sad but true. I feel like it's not the right approach long term. But let's see
[2:38:35] Tridos_: Yessir
[2:38:36] gracioussatan: shouldn’t you have more catch up sparks by now?
[2:38:42] V0Xgrey: im at 2230 on my dh with 7600 mastery
[2:39:00] ImPlutooo: I have no idea what class to play as a new player
[2:39:16] bigpumperrz: enjoying the stream , lets go
[2:39:17] anmusallam: your stream is lit bro
[2:39:19] swollenarmsx: @Tridos_ is that with your items scaled up?
[2:39:41] monsterblog: What do you think is the best healer to push glad is? Not sure the dps I'd be playing with
[2:39:41] HoneyDutch: 6300 is what the top dhs have
[2:39:55] zachgamegodx: some talk has been going around about removing the third stun dr and I do like that
[2:40:01] dropbombsss: is it holy priest time?
[2:40:15] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Only stun?
[2:40:29] bransby09: How did you manage 7200 mastery im mastery every slot still using bloom bracers and belt till i get the crated and im at 5943 or 77%
[2:40:48] zachgamegodx: well even rogues can appreciate the monk who tries to quarter dr the target whose dead next go not being able to do that
[2:40:52] dadfreddie: Played rogue in TBC, but was spec do you think is the easiest to get back into? Healer main atm..
[2:40:53] Badasti: on murlok.io they all seem to be rocking 6k mastery
[2:40:53] tooziqx: hi @venruki I’m pretty sure you’ve already been asked  million times about changes. but what do you think about them changing armor for cloth but not nerfing locks talent that multiply it?
[2:40:55] rotbodi: is this hardcore?
[2:40:55] tarth_100: @bransby09 is this mastery after hitting a pvp target dummy?
[2:41:01] pvalue01: @bransby09 u sure your pvp ilvl is activated?
[2:41:02] Tridos_: @swollenarmsx No thats unscaled
[2:41:09] gracioussatan: it’s very easy to check using drustvar
[2:41:12] bransby09: @pvalue01 Oh naw just raw standing there
[2:41:18] bransby09: Ill hit a dummy after this dungeon and see
[2:41:20] anmusallam: death knight wont suffer is what mesx is saying
[2:41:31] MaybeRespect: DKs are going to FLOP to bm,ww,war,demo
[2:41:35] vodkacran: yeah dks are going to get blasted hahaha
[2:41:36] zachgamegodx: it’ll be as noticeable as that frost mage 4 set buff
[2:41:39] MaybeRespect: But will be tankier into wizzard
[2:41:43] 3KuLTV: hows UH DK in pvp?
[2:41:43] volli94: When we get the boxes for our alts?
[2:41:46] Taevenx: if mes doesnt care, then why should we lol
[2:41:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Mes says Unholy DK is going to be alright
[2:41:55] heavymetal_warrior: Thoughts on Leeka's update on Drustvar for ladder distribution?
[2:41:59] gracioussatan: will frost dk be more common? idr if the buffs were for PvP or not
[2:42:15] MaybeRespect: @Taevenx Well he did say because AMS/AMZ increase. Which does not affect phys classes.
[2:42:15] Ambersulfr: I was thinking it would reduce people getting 1-shot
[2:42:19] anmusallam: he says we do magic so cloth changes doesnt matter and we might drop a pvp talent this reset so we can swap it with death strike wall, which gives 20% phys reduction
[2:42:19] leeka: i added a percentile line to it last night
[2:42:20] Badasti: I dont even feel like they needed to change armour, I think they should have just made hunters do elemental damage and thats it
[2:42:21] wEiRdO_dUdE: The 10% buff to health is kinda big for unholy toughness
[2:42:25] zachgamegodx: well yeah cause dks are gonna have 1.3 m health with 900 k shells
[2:42:29] zachgamegodx: what’s not to live
[2:42:30] Ambersulfr: but overall damage people probably aren’t going to notice
[2:42:31] zachgamegodx: love
[2:42:35] Taevenx: In Leeka We Trust <3
[2:42:36] heavymetal_warrior: it is orgasmic
[2:42:38] HoneyDutch: ww farms dk lol
[2:42:43] leeka: @Taevenx lol
[2:42:46] thendj: deaths strike is also % hp healing
[2:42:47] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Shell is 300k atm brother. It's like 40k more
[2:42:52] CHMage: where did ytou see ring of fire buff?
[2:42:53] Badasti: can they just make ring of fire baseline already and give us actual pvp talents
[2:43:02] Ambersulfr: no
[2:43:02] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect maybe in shuffle
[2:43:07] itzshenny: I love wow and 1 day wanna be the best (currently stuck 900 cr in shuffles) But 3 days ago my mom kicked me out because all I do is play this game and I have no where to go so I sleep in the libary dumpster at night and during the day I play wow using there free wifi. hopefuly 1 day I can be like you.
[2:43:10] What_ln_Tarnation: ToK buffed
[2:43:20] Taevenx: @leeka deserve all the praise, doing great work peepoClap
[2:43:33] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx I tested in duel. Also AMS not helping DK into phys dmg at all. So yes they gonna flop to phys including demo
[2:43:35] Badasti: @havenblood nothing stopping them from making it static dam amount for pve
[2:43:47] zachgamegodx: play blood forge ?
[2:43:54] zachgamegodx: it’s perma wall
[2:43:54] Unarmd: does ring of rife leave a dot or does it stop when you get out of it?
[2:44:05] Unarmd: fire*
[2:44:06] flames222: is ret going to lowkey be god tier? seeing all those changes has me in full panic that we are going back in time.
[2:44:08] Badasti: @Unarmd dot
[2:44:08] famous1939: @mindforcex seaf is underrated. i get message for using it but it blasts when used right
[2:44:09] gdodmebxu: Demo outlaw Pog

[2:44:32] drfeltgood: Ven how big of a hiot is WW taken?
[2:44:49] ATHLTE: lmao this song reminds me of the movie without a paddle
[2:44:55] zachgamegodx: how about ya don’t ibf the first stun ya take in the game @mayberespect you guys die bc you use every defensive you have to do more dmg rofl
[2:44:55] isseswagger: no faeline stomp more fun than bonedust
[2:45:01] zachgamegodx: and don’t even take blood forge
[2:45:04] Tridos_: What rating are you playing at?

[2:45:20] MrFuzzynuts420: KEKW
[2:45:22] zachgamegodx: if you used wall as not a 2nd trinket on your go , you’d live more trust
[2:45:25] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Trust me I don't. Wouldn't be 2.5 CR if i do. Also, FOF,evasion,disarm,retal etc.
[2:45:46] ItsBees: Pog
[2:45:54] ItsBees: I can heal Pog
[2:46:00] jo4sho85: do we get solo rbg in next season chat?
[2:46:04] zachgamegodx: don’t feel bad for dk at all, they’re over performing in both regions
[2:46:17] BicardiTV: what’s the new meta you expect?
[2:46:19] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx You seem very bias atm.
[2:46:20] volli94: @jo4sho85 hope so
[2:46:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH + Ret might be the ticket after weekly reset
[2:46:26] isseswagger: @jo4sho85 or start of next exp
[2:46:52] gdodmebxu: Chatting discredited Chatting
[2:46:58] volli94: someone knows when we get the conquest chest for alts?
[2:47:05] gracioussatan: so discredited
[2:47:27] Ambersulfr: @volli94 Tuesday
[2:47:42] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect I have a pretty balanced perspective, I’ve gotten most specs to elite this szn bc I like hoping around I know the weaknesses and pros of most things
[2:48:34] Hobblefoot: @zachgamegodx Same.  Except I am stuck at Challenger on 13 toons. Soooooo ...
[2:48:37] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Well, the "you guys" zug every cd for dmg so you die. Is well, untrue for higher rated, and irrelevant when talking about BF 3 sec duration
[2:48:47] gracioussatan: @volli94 next week when conquest cap is lifted probably
[2:49:11] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx It's quite hard to maintain bloodforged. Given FOF,Disarm,retal,evasion,stuns and ranged kite.
[2:49:24] MaybeRespect: That's all I was saying.
[2:49:48] zachgamegodx: i mean ibf durinb your go for more pressure is something even the best dks do currently.. why? because they can get away with it and it means more pressure. why don’t they run bloodforged? bc they don’t need it! maybe you will have to run it
[2:50:23] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Bro that's actually so untrue. Sometimes maybe, IBF into rogues go to stop team from dying and saving trinket
[2:50:44] figurines: Are people still complaining about the 5-8% armor nerf that only affects like 3 classes that do physical damage that is also offset by the stamina buff? pathetic
[2:51:01] gracioussatan: I don’t see complaining
[2:51:01] figurines: Be worried about warlocks. maybe rets?
[2:51:06] figurines: plate will be 100% fine
[2:51:17] gdodmebxu: HUH
[2:51:33] ItsBees: didja add anything to the oatmeal?
[2:51:36] gracioussatan: it’s going to be more of a nothing burger than everyone thinks

[2:51:46] Taevenx: would be great, "the sky is falling" and it's just another tuesday

[2:52:06] taylorperiod: bejewled dates?
[2:52:06] gracioussatan: how much dark choco?
[2:52:13] theodeth: never combined peanut butter with yogurt before
[2:52:23] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect I’ve seen shadow, pet kick ibf first stun in many games
[2:52:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chanimal becomes a raid boss... the locks are fine LUL
[2:52:30] gdodmebxu: @whackster like 4% KEKW
[2:52:43] figurines: I dropped oatmeal for cream of wheat with bananas and raisins. never looked back
[2:52:46] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Many...i would argue less than 20%
[2:53:05] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Unless V Rogues. Prob higher.
[2:53:17] eyah: can you play arcane by chance :)
[2:53:18] zachgamegodx: dks are not squishy at all in the meta, they’re over performing
[2:53:19] Xeliumimar: can't go wrong with eggs
[2:53:28] stealthwalker99: I'm just surprised there isn't a single patch note for enh sham
[2:53:28] figurines: @venruki SAME SAME SAME. Are you my brother?
[2:53:33] figurines: ;)
[2:53:41] thendj: cream of wheat with sugar and protein powder is incredible
[2:53:42] monsterblog: Best healer for 3s after patch?
[2:53:48] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx You keep changing topic aye. I give up :(
[2:53:49] zachgamegodx: dh dk is winning wwdk often times
[2:53:51] pvalue01: @monsterblog still rdruid
[2:54:18] eyah: thanks!
[2:54:29] figurines: @venruki can you explain why primordial wave is better than insta lava burst w/ master elements on rsham? (especially after damage buffs coming for rsham).
[2:54:44] jabbahutt89: amazing mage buffs Kappa
[2:54:45] figurines: 20% nature buff every single insta lava burst seems stronger than primordial no?
[2:54:46] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect I’m sorry about that, each of us entitled to our opinions
[2:55:03] Ernanz: Ven log on Retribuki and lets play Cupid :)
[2:55:13] yesterday_potato: Ven I think we need a pre patch tier list prediction and the a post patch "was right". Free YT content
[2:55:14] zachgamegodx: it will be pretty cool to have 20% bigger lava boorsts
[2:55:18] gracioussatan: throwing
[2:55:22] zachgamegodx: those fckers may hit 140-150
[2:55:24] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Nah. It's fine, we went from dk into phys to bloodforged duration to performance
[2:55:26] xvpsp: Venruki i wanna know your opinion about the patch
[2:55:35] figurines: Walk me through the numbers of why primordial 26% healing wave and 40% healing wave cleave is better. i dont see it. i even tried both and i dont see it
[2:55:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Love the tier lists
[2:55:50] frazzoqt: What keybinds do you use for arena target 123?
[2:55:59] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx All in all, they are a train target. Generally.
[2:56:08] figurines: its not a 40% modifier. it causes 40% of the healing to cleave
[2:56:14] gelatokush: @figurines it works in 2s ive tested it out  in 3s in on paper is just as good but you so global starved that getting value is harder also u can have base prim wave and master of element
[2:56:15] zachgamegodx: @mayberespect you’re fine to worry about your main or one of your mains but imo they’re doing great and these changes do benefit them and hurt them at the same time so I think they’ll end up still good
[2:56:43] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx No doubt stronger vs. wizards. Survival wise.
[2:56:58] gracioussatan: it sounds situational based on what you’re facing
[2:57:09] DatBombSkunk: HypeHands1 HypeHands1 HypeHands1
[2:57:13] MaybeRespect: @zachgamegodx Bit more limited comp wise though. DH, maybe demo.
[2:57:18] figurines: OK thanks for talking me through it. I was just feeling like I was getting insane value out of the 20% buff each lava burst. I hear that logic tho
[2:57:30] Axtin: idk theyve been talking about dks for 20 minutes
[2:57:36] MaybeRespect: Ahh just DK into physical damage
[2:57:40] MaybeRespect: Nothing crazy
[2:57:44] taylorperiod: @Axtin HAHAA
[2:58:02] MaybeRespect: yeah DK will be stranger into wizards very much so.
[2:58:06] MaybeRespect: stronger*
[2:58:09] DjRio: jungle about to slap into plate

[2:58:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those diseases are still going to burn people

[2:59:24] gracioussatan: I’m a victim
[2:59:31] 3KuLTV: ven, rank your healers from best to worst?
[2:59:41] ItsBees: Sadge
[2:59:47] figurines: the only issue i've seen with the armor changes is warlocks being tanks
[2:59:55] gracioussatan: they will be
[2:59:56] ItsBees: As a terrible resto druid, yes they'll still be crazy
[2:59:56] figurines: after a lot of maths
[2:59:58] DjRio: i just know you was pumping that round
[3:00:02] gracioussatan: 5% healing is nothing lmao
[3:00:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: 5% less healing is still plenty of treants
[3:00:15] starskedc: impish instincts needs a nurf if locks cant die tbh
[3:00:17] flyingorangee: arcane Pog
[3:00:20] MaybeRespect: I think the broccoli will still heal fine.
[3:00:26] anmusallam: the sod dev team brought warlock tank to retail

[3:00:35] gelatokush: has anyone tried to tank a raid as warlock on ptr
[3:00:38] eyah: is dragons breath the same school as blinding light @venruki

[3:00:53] gdodmebxu: why are treants in the game monkaTOS
[3:00:53] Viuffx: they should've made it so they had to cast ever
[3:01:09] Magottx: Ven!
[3:01:24] ATHLTE: as a rdru main, treants needa go lmaoo
[3:01:29] MaybeRespect: HST is like their top 2 heals right?
[3:01:32] ATHLTE: they come outta no where
[3:01:35] zachgamegodx: did you know with the hero talents that the treants will be moonfiring nearby enemies for Resto ?
[3:01:36] dipicat: i cant believe they gave the heal-over-time healer npcs t hat heal for them too
[3:01:45] strafekey: Rsham get water eles healing everyone with riptides
[3:01:46] dropbombsss: anyone know how to disable enemy treant nameplates? its not minions or pets
[3:01:46] gracioussatan: they were designed with PvE in mind and like many things become broke. in PvP
[3:01:52] tarth_100: I dont like the current trend in more smart healing added to the game
[3:01:57] kusoneko: considering old tier set was healing stream totem cast a chain heal too, thats not too far off
[3:02:05] figurines: BATMAN CLEAVE!!!!
[3:02:07] Caedalade: I'll heal that
[3:02:12] ItsBees: I can heal that LUL

[3:02:58] kusoneko: Erm, actually Demon Hunters hate demons, thats why theyre hunting them 🤓
[3:03:02] gdodmebxu: i think when you cast ascendance on rsham it should summon lumberjacks that take the treants out insta

[3:08:12] gelatokush: 41 on vertical is insane considering MJ was 38
[3:08:13] theodeth: i think i read that wrong
[3:08:15] rekt1370: sumo is easier but if the guy is sumo insane amount of weight still impressive
[3:08:24] thisisthotcaller: lol, thats exactly what people say about one of my best mates who won powerlifiting worlds /  a big comp held in sheffield

[3:09:35] zachgamegodx: @gelatokush jumping MJ's big ass body is harder, having close to the same as an athlete 1 foot below him is pretty insane

[3:10:23] gelatokush: @zachgamegodx MJ was 6,6 he had way longer legs therefore easier to achieve for him and yet he still had a lower vertical ...
[3:10:24] llllliiilllii: it's insanely strong but I feel like sumo lifter gonna be at desavantage soon if the IPF switch rules like women arch bench
[3:10:24] dipicat: dyllbar is the most american canadian of all time and thats a fact

[3:57:25] Ernanz: nothing can compare to a Rogue. its that simple
[3:57:29] Badasti: only because the rogue isn't doing dam with all his actions, half is going to cc LUL
[3:57:32] rembrandt89: maybe delusional
[3:57:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah Whaazz is probably doing the same thing

[3:59:16] revzzz1: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance ratirlJAM ratirlJAM ratirlJAM
[3:59:25] Ernanz: @drdoomkinx all that dmg doesnt matter, WW die in 1 stun.
[3:59:25] DrBabadookMD: Is it super hard to survive on a resto druid with a rogue on you? That's why I quit a year ago
[3:59:27] khrylx_: duel needs to go
[3:59:30] What_ln_Tarnation: @drdoomkinx if you losing to ww as a rogue, it's a you problem
[3:59:37] notkoalars: enhance actually kinda owns
[3:59:46] ZeroOmegaLul: Yet the FoF stuns were seen as too much. LUL
[3:59:57] Senseixww: ww doesnt need the dmg it has tbh rather just have another stun and cdr gone
[3:59:59] drdoomkinx: @Ernanz so does every thing else :P
[4:00:08] gracioussatan: is meep gonna rage quit this lobby too
[4:00:15] Badasti: @What_ln_Tarnation idk, I don't think WW is a poor indie spec either right now... Not saying Rogues aren't broking but WW is pretty insane
[4:00:39] Somanie: @khrylx_ all classes really do if you have the perfect situation, that's why palumor made a vid
[4:00:48] xGriefxGodx: meep is competitive, he's not a crybaby
[4:00:48] gracioussatan: WW dies so easy, glass cannon shit
[4:01:05] Badasti: @gracioussatan thats absolute nonsense bro, good ww's feel immortal XD
[4:01:10] gracioussatan: rogue is immortal and does tons of damage with infinite CC
[4:01:15] Somanie: but the beefiest monk opener i've seen this season has beat the beefiest rogue opener i've seen this season if that makes any sense
[4:01:34] gdodmebxu: @Somanie idk sub can kill in opener KEKW
[4:01:41] sunsetjaxon: why don't you cc then ?
[4:01:48] Senseixww: mystical made a clip and put it on twitter of him pressing fort brew (6min cd) at 68% hp and still dying through..
[4:02:02] rembrandt89: every rogue spec can kill in opener atm
[4:02:06] drdoomkinx: @Badasti yeah i was fighting chun on WW and he legit never died always lived 10% and got out
[4:02:20] gdodmebxu: all classes die through pre wall to dh dk
[4:02:23] malvarcla: played agaist biggpharma yesterday he seems pretty good
[4:02:25] gracioussatan: enjoy not casting at all this round !
[4:02:33] Somanie: depends on your team and how they can handle certain things ofc, but yeah rogues and monks aren't to be underestimated no matter what
[4:02:52] gdodmebxu: monk easier to stop
[4:02:56] gdodmebxu: sub cheap shots your whole team
[4:02:57] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got MASSIVE 10.2.5 Class Tuning & PvP Changes" view it here: youtu.be/LFKMv81If4A

[4:03:03] gdodmebxu: or duels
[4:03:09] gdodmebxu: or bombs
[4:03:10] Somanie: that's true
[4:03:25] gracioussatan: maybe you can bait the kick bots :o
[4:03:36] drdoomkinx: i love that bigdam has 2-3 accounts and he ques enhance on all of them LUL
[4:03:58] SacsTvT: rogues are stupid tho, trinket that bomb stun opener and u will die in that duel stun combo
[4:04:16] Senseixww: the 10% evis nerf is gonna fix the class guys dw..
[4:04:18] balistikk64: okay

[4:04:45] Nadasky: @Acurarx Hooooly that's scary KEKW
[4:05:05] drdoomkinx: @Acurarx its ok you can still mind spike for 250k :)
[4:05:14] gracioussatan: man dealing with 2 shears and 2 groundings looks sooo irritating as a caster

[4:18:23] Hawxix: how could blizzard solve such an issue?

[4:26:56] Fros365: Being good at DH I see Rping by being blind LUL
[4:27:02] ImJordanHi: @aod0311x And maybe you could get the same info elsewhere, but the consolidation of data is what you're paying for
[4:27:02] lasergazer3: awesome playlist

[4:28:37] ImJordanHi: Why doesn't WoW bring in any new players?! LUL Because someone who's played for 15 years cant figure out what's going on
[4:28:46] ImJordanHi: Literally digital vomit
[4:29:20] Bigmoran: @aod0311x Not biased but I think Skill Capped is good for learning WoW.
[4:29:21] Bigvuqoffdam: ozzy down bad
[4:29:36] soulmanager: ozzy bit a bat
[4:29:42] dawsonator171: poor ozzy getting a crazy train run on him

[4:30:50] soulmanager: @Aypex01 have people find you instead 5Head
[4:30:56] Ambersulfr: it’s frustrating to watch your rating drop but you learn more by trying new things than you do by camping your max rating on the singular comp you know how to play with exactly two other people

[4:44:05] Stoichulk: lizard dmg is stupid

[4:48:39] OttoFrank1945: What was your rating @ arcane?
[4:49:00] OttoFrank1945: Wow nice
[4:49:08] memil141: dang
[4:49:17] soulmanager: is arcane the best mage spec atm?
[4:49:23] jfachal: you’re the best mage in the world!
[4:49:29] wackpoetic: is this Adam Szabo?
[4:49:42] taywright23: maybe noob question, but do you have to pay for 2 accounts to be logged in on 2 characters?
[4:49:45] wackpoetic: oh I had music playing in the background OMEGALUL
[4:49:56] soulmanager: Fire Sadge
[4:50:02] dropbombsss: @taywright23 nah streamer client Kappa
[4:50:05] Sindorii: is mage tower still a thing?
[4:50:06] Extramediums: I need to learn arcane, I just tried it out in a bg, and doesn't feel like I'm doing damage lol
[4:50:09] stealthwalker99: You should get the addon "BetterCharacterPanel" It's pretty helpful to see enchants/sockets if you are missing anything
[4:50:29] crazzbez: maybe next time
[4:50:29] mnowpsn: Aegis said he thinks it's best by a long shot but I thought other specs were decent idk
[4:50:31] OttoFrank1945: Same. 15% less hp to do same damage as others SeemsGood
[4:50:35] jfachal: what would you have wanted them to do to fire mage ?
[4:50:38] belvedee: the changes were definitely a curve ball.
[4:50:42] taywright23: @dropbombsss thank you so only streamers can use it?
[4:50:43] Awkn_: Name of headphones?
[4:50:44] soulmanager: @taywright23 yes
[4:50:47] yesterday_potato: You know who needs love? Me on prevoker. God i suck
[4:50:57] dropbombsss: @taywright23 ha noo im kidding need 2 accounts
[4:51:00] Dreathhammer: SL and bfa lol
[4:51:04] wackpoetic: because Triune is OP
[4:51:08] soulmanager: what nerfed barrier?
[4:51:10] OttoFrank1945: They forgot lol
[4:51:14] Ambersulfr: are all the others unnerfed?
[4:51:18] spellgunx: you re trading 15% of your health to do less damage than warlocks
[4:51:29] soothingmistmonk: What are your thoughts on giving all cloth specs +35% more armor.  Doesn't this make locks more tanky then they already are?
[4:51:33] zachgamegodx: in all fairness, the difference wouldnt' change much, it would be 5% hp per cast
[4:51:37] zachgamegodx: if unnerfed
[4:51:37] spellgunx: and boomies
[4:51:38] Ambersulfr: oh that is weird
[4:51:39] spellgunx: and eles
[4:51:40] lasergazer3: why?
[4:51:40] soulmanager: Madge
[4:51:43] Badasti: didnt it get nerfed because of some borrowed power bullshit?
[4:51:50] Ambersulfr: probably
[4:51:51] taywright23: @dropbombsss lmao
[4:51:53] mmaric700: so you answer only pvp questions?
[4:52:04] Thoreya: ravens or texans
[4:52:05] felsteg: favorite class so far in df
[4:52:13] froshizzlelol: its okay theyll be the immortal god class tuesday
[4:52:23] lowluds: is it tough to get geared if i have not played in a long time?
[4:52:27] froshizzlelol: mages
[4:52:31] wmanrespecter: seeing you play dh made me see the dark side is a lot more fun ty
[4:52:33] zemm8582: lol no they won't
[4:52:36] zemm8582: locks will be though
[4:52:37] burekodsira12: What is the name of this song?
[4:52:38] OttoFrank1945: You mean locks?
[4:52:39] SwiisH_Tv: Arcane will be with Demo
[4:52:40] OttoFrank1945: Lol
[4:52:42] atorob: nah i think locks will be
[4:52:44] sourbutts: locks will be insane
[4:52:46] felgazer: warlocks will be gods
[4:52:47] froshizzlelol: lol its a joke but im talking about the armor buff
[4:52:51] Sosatko: I think glass cannon is kinda troll why doesn’t dh lose 15% HP to get essence break
[4:52:51] klikka: mages are far from immortal now how can they be on tuesday
[4:52:52] dailyshuffle: immortal god class LUL
[4:52:56] zachgamegodx: why is bonedust brew still nerfed from shadowlands, why is glory of the dawn nerfed by 50% in pvp when it deals 20k dmg crits (was nerfed in like BFA as an azerite trait)
[4:53:01] zachgamegodx: these are the questions
[4:53:01] UziiB: if i start a freshy toon rn, can i just play till i have 6300 conq?
[4:53:02] Badasti: @mindforcex 30% of nothing is nothing
[4:53:09] wackpoetic: Mages are going to be able to Glacial you and it won't even break Frost Nova no Kapp
[4:53:10] itz_killjoy: bros really think 30% more armor for cloth is 30% more dmg reduction
[4:53:10] Drathimos: the armor buff only gives them 3% phys dmg reduction LUL
[4:53:13] ButtaTWD: mages have very nice mobility
[4:53:14] ItsBees: @UziiB yes :D
[4:53:15] MisterThatDude: @mindforcex this^^
[4:53:20] froshizzlelol: ww needs stuns
[4:53:32] Sosatko: why don’t rogues lose 15% HP for sepsis
[4:53:32] MisterThatDude: aff lock survivability is not fun either
[4:53:33] buttercps: cloth classes should die easily
[4:53:37] srslol: ww gonna pop off tues
[4:53:38] scandalouzzz: lets talk sp. not even know where to begin
[4:53:40] edweezybruh: they need to nerf sub more than they did
[4:53:40] Sochill_theill: is disc still doing great?
[4:53:41] Pwnyo808: i swear they should delete surv hunter as a spec, it's so bad
[4:53:42] zachgamegodx: glory of the dawn is like 11k dmg with a low chance to proc tho
[4:53:43] Duides: How will MM be on Tuesday?
[4:53:44] Sosatko: I think glass cannon is just bad design
[4:53:44] MisterThatDude: I just want aff to be viable. Don't even care if its good just viable
[4:53:48] hemsho: IMO mages should die the fastest, but Im a scrub tho
[4:53:50] Drathimos: 35% armor does not mean 35% more mitigation. its actually only a 3% physical defense buff
[4:53:54] zachgamegodx: no reason why they'd carry it over
[4:53:55] likeewlock: 30% more armor is like 4% physical reduction I guess a lot of ppl dont understand
[4:53:56] malvarcla: yeah but mages are gonna be face tanks now right
[4:53:57] zachgamegodx: they're just lazy
[4:54:13] Drathimos: stay in school kids LUL
[4:54:15] squirtlesquirt: THIS IS STORMWIND WTF?!?!?
[4:54:21] zachgamegodx: i had to make a forum post for them to update the modifier on lava lash on enhance bc it was inconsistient with their hotfix for weeks
[4:54:21] itz_killjoy: @buttercps why should cloth classes die easy? they are wizards, they dont wear heavy armor they use magic to defend themselves your logic is trash
[4:54:26] Sosatko: yeah but no other class has to make that choice
[4:54:34] figurines: It is crazy how bad the pvp devs reputation has got. I don't know a single player that respects them at all
[4:54:34] sourbutts: glasscannon should be a talent not a pvp talent
[4:54:35] froshizzlelol: i just started playing frost its way more fun than ww
[4:54:36] galdinator: glass cannon is way too tempting
[4:54:40] wmanrespecter: is 4 piece more important than weapon for dh?
[4:54:49] zachgamegodx: jinx is cool
[4:54:50] srslol: I enjoy kiss / curse talents
[4:54:50] Sosatko: like I said why don’t dh have to take 15% less hp for essence break or rogues 15% for sepsis
[4:54:51] buttercps: @itz_killjoy because if ppl can connect to cloth classes they should take damage because they dont have armor .
[4:54:55] zemm8582: death wish is all i can think of
[4:54:58] lfkappachupa: hi it is possible to say what addons u use for arena?
[4:55:00] Sosatko: i think it can be okay but not for one spec only
[4:55:04] soothingmistmonk: We need to talk about your mog man.... You do more damage when you look good!
[4:55:07] zachgamegodx: the affliction one
[4:55:15] Ambersulfr: I really like those talents
[4:55:15] klikka: thiefs bargain
[4:55:21] soothingmistmonk: DH BRUH
[4:55:23] zachgamegodx: oor triple ua
[4:55:26] Nuallan94: male belf is so ugly man
[4:55:28] bloodandguts7: Venruki hi bro how van I play ww monk to PERFECTION ? pvp
[4:55:31] itz_killjoy: @buttercps "IF" they connect? how can't any class in the game connect to a cloth wearer class?
[4:55:32] zachgamegodx: i guess aff has all the kiss curses
[4:55:34] bloodandguts7: Huge fan man u are the best
[4:55:40] MisterThatDude: triple UA kidd/curse kinda sucks
[4:55:41] healhut: all of sub's crazy talents and cdr reduction should have a stam penalty
[4:55:48] soulmanager: i can't play a mog without it matching my spec
[4:56:01] Ambersulfr: sub is an example of a spec that should have more downsides to their talents
[4:56:04] Ambersulfr: cause holy shit
[4:56:10] zachgamegodx: vens evoker, dh, aand lock are all men and they're the same model so you just called them all ugly

[5:12:29] lasergazer3: I'm kinda sad that retail has become 20-35% UI and the rest gameplay in the background. Always found I mostly watch icons and cd's over the actual game, fights, effects and such

[5:12:37] heleander: one does not simply win against that pally

[5:13:20] Ambersulfr: @carmswolo rsham is sketchy in solo, it’s not u
[5:13:21] aragarde: too many pets
[5:13:58] Carmswolo: yeah im getting that sense. if i dont press everything perfectly on sham my team just dies
[5:13:59] MisterThatDude: so many pets, Bm hunters should have max 2 pets, dk's 1 pet
[5:14:09] dethrot: yo ven im just getting back into wow again from S1, whats bestway to get gear?

[6:13:52] memil141: smart
[6:13:52] Badasti: and the optuion to accept queue from the app
[6:13:59] boomkin_exploit: tell them to charge a dollar for it and they actually might do it
[6:14:01] highmoon7: but how will you accept queue when it pops mid stream XD

[6:14:57] rank1playerlul: they should name pvp battlemasters after old school pvp players @venruki
[6:14:58] Volgi95: some people use things like Teamviewer
[6:14:59] Drathimos: assuming the tech exists for that
[6:15:01] Bigvuqoffdam: it would encourage people to afk and not play the game between qs
[6:15:02] Sindorii: bots?
[6:15:02] danieltsmoke: like you specify just for solo shuffle or whatever
[6:15:12] gamerdadhooper: how are you liking DH so far?
[6:15:13] StromicusRex: people accepting queue a billion years away and being afk in the game
[6:15:15] Nubfrlife: AFK's at game start because people still wiping

[6:15:25] Volgi95: I remember a hearthstone player using Teamviewer to join for ques
[6:15:29] Volgi95: or play cards
[6:15:29] blyynx: Yeah afks first round would be rough
[6:15:34] ImJordanHi: The obvious is that people could actually be busy, accept the queue and your team mate is half AFK all game because he really shouldnt have accepted it.
[6:15:35] taylorperiod: @Volgi95 LO9L
[6:15:38] Badasti: @Bigvuqoffdam dunno about you but between queues i sit and watch twitch in valdrakken XD
[6:15:57] MythicBlack520: you think theyll ever do 2s solo shuffle?
[6:16:00] danieltsmoke: I wouldnt allow an accept button, but like...so often Im just downstairs, within 10 seconds, I just dont know the damn que popped
[6:16:25] Badasti: @danieltsmoke why? whats the difference of having an accept button>
[6:16:37] Bigvuqoffdam: @Badasti i play healer :)
[6:16:41] Nubfrlife: Maybe make harsher punishments for those that are AFK at game start for anyone who accepted through the app?
[6:16:46] zachgamegodx: realistically they could improve q times by a significant amount if they gave 10-15s more time on accepting qs, leading to less lobby failures
[6:16:46] Volgi95: nt
[6:17:04] danieltsmoke: @Badasti like in case you ended up with people clicking accept and then not getting to their computer or whatever
[6:17:04] Badasti: @Bigvuqoffdam this guy and his insta queue privilege
[6:17:11] chancywilson: a feral in 2s is most annoying class
