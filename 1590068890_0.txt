[3:53:32] OGTigolebitties: @Swifty hey i have been a stalker for forever. You know what your talking about but any drive that is SSD you should always be able to get that storage. When you mention apple it scares me when you talk about them from a storage standpoint...
[3:53:57] OGTigolebitties: yeah but its not a "stop doing it thing"
[3:54:19] NikroTH: the secret: buy an android
[3:54:20] Myownloli: apple is just an evil company
[3:54:22] billybaroo1: True, buying iCloud storage is ridonkulous. Just put that stuff on the computer and free space up is win.
[3:54:25] sarenix: @ogkoop aaah hahaha i meant sad for the drive thing swifty is talking and you about the phone but we both writte sad almost about the same time LOL
[3:54:32] Tordrek_: maybe stop using iphone?

[4:01:12] stepbro_puffin: iCloud is not the same as phone storage
[4:01:13] R1ch3n: that's a lot of photos monkaS
[4:01:14] EvenstarTV: it's icloud storage, not device storage
[4:01:16] reeaal: I think the Icloud storage is different than normal storage
[4:01:18] Adam_S97: That was complaining about your cloud storage
[4:01:20] Kadmac25: Phone storage and icloud storage are different
[4:01:24] InciteTV: Hey Swifty, It's really nice seeing you like the good old days. LuvBlush

[4:01:50] LukeLuphin: What you should do is buy Android
[4:01:58] InciteTV: Laughs in android LUL
[4:02:04] Kadmac25: You can go into icloud settings and turn off back up pictures but then it will only be on your phone.
[4:02:10] Schwety: Cloud storage is your backup, in case you lose your phone
[4:02:19] Xaviwan078: NOOO
[4:02:19] R1ch3n: it all starts with a dollar PepeHands
[4:02:23] シュード: but its only $1 maaaang Kappa
[4:02:25] Kadmac25: Yep, exactly
[4:02:25] Troybuiltgaming: use a camera....
[4:02:31] thetexanmando: yeah paying monthly for extra storage is a sam
[4:02:43] R1ch3n: what about 50 cents Kappa
[4:02:43] 1Miraculix: dont use iphone  :D
[4:02:46] thetexanmando: scam*
[4:02:48] InciteTV: Btw the IPhone 14 no sim card seems to be a US thing only for now.
[4:02:56] シュード: what about 1TB for 50c... sounds good huh?
[4:03:02] SE_GHO5T: Andrid SeemsGood
[4:03:05] Kadmac25: I kinda want to switch from my iphone to z fold 4.
[4:03:09] R1ch3n: e???
[4:03:09] thetexanmando: its like paying extra monthly to use the key fob of a car you bought
[4:03:13] OGTigolebitties: hahahhaha dude let me know when you find that CLOUD STORAGE price
[4:03:14] R1ch3n: no sim card???
[4:03:18] InciteTV: They removed the tray for Iphone 14
[4:03:19] シュード: virtual sim
[4:03:20] Kadmac25: Iphone 14 is esim only in US
[4:03:21] krezay: ye its only esim
[4:03:21] EvenstarTV: Icloud storage is a subscription you already have with apple, like $1 a month for 50GB, your device storage is, no matter what new device you get, you will always get that message
[4:03:30] PermaGrinnn: get mask for pvp
[4:03:32] Kadmac25: It uses esim
[4:03:36] Weaboodeluxe: iphone is the supreme of phones, same as a normal phone
[4:03:41] krezay: esim
[4:03:45] Fuegan: ive got no sim card in my 12 promax
[4:03:47] OGTigolebitties: do you even look into tech or cloud storage at all? like anyone investing in MCSFT would know
[4:03:49] Dibles714: cause its an iphone
[4:03:51] R1ch3n: def staying with my iphone 13
[4:03:51] Tommy3k: you can
[4:03:53] krezay: you can change services
[4:03:54] Seastarx: they are going to add an esim card thing so you have get a code from your service provider to activate
[4:03:55] billybaroo1: iCloud is just a rack of hard drives sitting in a basement somewhere charging u money. Just use your hard drives for free.
[4:03:58] OGTigolebitties: wat are u doing? @Swifty
[4:03:58] InciteTV: But again, this is only in the US right now. The rest of the world has it. This is a big problem for people who travel.
[4:04:03] Schwety: Cloud storage is a form a backup, just incase you drop your phone in a lake or it gets ran over.   If you can't manually transfer your pics and videos.
[4:04:06] Kadmac25: Make room for other stuff in the phone. Sim card slot takes up too much space so easier to have it be esim. Stinks for people that travel though or switch phones a lot
[4:04:10] OGTigolebitties: services? jesus christ
[4:04:25] krezay: its done over a phone app or a qr code the supplier sends you
[4:04:40] EvenstarTV: Icloud storage is a subscription you already have with apple, like $1 a month for 50GB, your device storage is is different, no matter what new iPhone you get, you will always get that message.
[4:05:20] Schwety: Swifty, its a scam, i agree with you, but sadly its needed.

[4:08:56] OGTigolebitties: I sell them all the time , its a huge market from a B2B standpoint
[4:09:12] corruptReality: iTunes installs bloatware also
