[0:32:48] Orirholim: if 04/2023 is the release date, i think that's fine, sucks to wait a year but that's fine
[0:32:56] lithium364: the artbox cover looks good tho, i really like the green/red vibe
[0:33:12] dankmeliodas: They would be stupid if they tied player power to something like covenants again.

[0:33:39] Rictue: 1 more year of shadowlands really ?
[0:33:43] MaxedLuck_: of course they will dank. what else is taking 12+ more months to finish unless its 15 borrowed power systems?
[0:33:43] dankmeliodas: No way it’s this year
[0:33:44] Xsilentghost: @Orirholim Thats your cart expiration date for the online preorders
[0:33:47] EmpathyLiveChat: We might have to wait a year but at least 10.0 will definitely save the game
[0:33:54] dankmeliodas: Early 2023
[0:34:00] b34v3rbr0: 04/2023 makes shadowlands the longest expansion evenr right?

[0:37:12] dankmeliodas: No way it comes out before early 2023 if they released it earlier than that we would be getting another un finished xpac

[0:42:28] Orirholim: the mythic+ encompassing all dungeons and raidfinder having every single wow raid in it is kind of crazy but that means they're going the FFXIV group finder route

[0:43:37] eziz86: Dragonflight Expansion  lv70 maybe ?
[0:43:40] Dagomarus: it make sense though once the dragons gave up their "aspects" it left a power vacuum, i think we will probably end up restoring the dragons their aspects and funneling our chosen dragon family "dragon force" (basically anima) till they gain their aspect power back
[0:43:56] lithium364: i mean we could find out that stormdragons protodragons etc also have Leaders like alex
[0:44:02] Orirholim: @SpidercowSD apparently disgruntled ex=employee leaked it but it could be a legit PR leak by Blizzard too, who knows... might not even be true

[0:50:46] Tjenne92: "CHAMPYUN, WE MUST HELP THE DRAGOONS TO TEND THE WOONS OF AZEROTH"
[0:50:47] Orirholim: Could Dragonflight just be a placeholder for the real name, though? Or is their art that was leaked too?
[0:50:49] AureliusXV: well they did have their sale in the store with the dragin bundle
[0:50:50] Shrenko: can wait to get them dragon nuts
[0:50:51] EscapePlan01: was there foreshadowing for dragon isles before?

[0:51:09] captiv8: @lithium364 i think there is still a chance we get Tinker
[0:51:09] szble: Clueless guess this means dragon tinkers
[0:51:14] AureliusXV: masturbate?
[0:51:19] pavepawns: evacuate
[0:51:29] Shrenko: Dragonborn = new class
[0:51:30] LesterLinton: man i hope for 1 new class at least that'd be great
[0:51:35] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[0:51:48] Gurtogg: the leak says "World of Warcraft: Dragonflight™ releases on or before August 29th, 2023"
[0:51:56] b34v3rbr0: cant call it "dragonborn" or tod howard will come after blizz with a vengeance
[0:51:56] EmpathyLiveChat: lol
[0:52:01] pavepawns: so now that we know the expansion can we just have the reveal cinematic now <3 :P
[0:52:05] Shrenko: Dragonborn fusrodaaaah
[0:52:07] youbylon: I really doubt were getting a new class. The devs cant even balance the current ones
[0:52:12] NBK_Sethus: no new class so they can work on more meaningful choices Kappa
[0:52:13] Collected1: Dark Hunters and I'm back. even if it's just a spell skin. sign me up. undead pets? hell yes.
[0:52:19] Exoduc: @nutnibble microsoft owns both blizzard and bethesda
[0:52:20] cappei: no no, there will be mechanical dragons that pave the way for tinkers. Teriz is already writing it up on mmo-champion OMEGALUL
[0:52:23] Melgor101: draenor ?
[0:52:27] Ezekyler: well Shadowlands turned into a stupid expansion
[0:52:27] Dagomarus: New Class, Dragon Lancer, with a lance that does dragon things very asian class idea LUL
[0:52:30] Cabbageman007: Panda Dragons??
[0:52:33] zigzugg: Legio was shit Kappa
[0:52:45] spookyfacegaming: Solution: split it up to be Flight of the Dragons.
[0:52:45] Nejba: @Gurtogg then that means "earliest August 2023 or delayed"
[0:52:53] Orirholim: World of Warcraft: Legend of the Dragoon
[0:53:05] captiv8: Legion is my favorite xpac.  I've been playing since Vanilla too
[0:53:06] Jarlan23: fucking loved that game
[0:53:08] SpyCrabbo: @Collected1 you can already tame undead pets tho, since BFA
[0:53:14] LesterLinton: how did ppl know to look at the js file tho, that's incredible luck
[0:53:14] Jarlan23: legend of dragoon was my childhood
[0:53:30] lithium364: did lore say anything about the leak to you? like was he surprised or kinda expected someone would fuck up eventually?
[0:53:32] Orirholim: JRPGs were the shit back in the day, nothing like it these days
[0:53:32] The_Mail_Man__: to gm everyone
[0:53:33] The_Mail_Man__: yo*
[0:53:38] Orirholim: except FFXIV
[0:53:50] b34v3rbr0: @LesterLinton maybe some ppl from blizz leaked it on purpose to wowhead people to spark some hype :)
[0:54:05] Jarlan23: the new dragon quest game had that old school feel to if
[0:54:06] Jarlan23: it
[0:54:09] Jarlan23: if you played that
[0:54:16] LesterLinton: yee maybe! like the artwork picture was a couple of hours later and that now seems real
[0:54:20] Orirholim: never got into DQ but heard it was good
[0:54:20] Broomba: @lithium364 I seriously doubt it
[0:54:30] AureliusXV: if you all think this was found on accident and blizzard put this there not knowing someone would find it ....gullible
[0:54:38] dankmeliodas: The earlier leak on mmo champion I feel like was a mix of real and fake stuff to throw people off a bit
[0:54:40] Kinghorn: do they have someone at wowhead whose job is just stare at the website code 24/7? LUL
[0:54:43] Orirholim: my top JRPG will always be Xenogears
[0:54:46] b34v3rbr0: blizzard "accidentally" leaks their expansion every time lol
[0:54:50] lithium364: yeah the photo coming out almost at the same time seems staged from blizzard themselves
[0:54:59] AureliusXV: creates hype
[0:55:01] Orirholim: @Danklobos the Incursion one?
[0:55:02] Collected1: it creates some good hype
[0:55:04] Jarlan23: i remember being on the 1up boards always talking about what they could do for a new legend of dragoon game
[0:55:05] Collected1: gets the train started
[0:55:06] LesterLinton: yee
[0:55:07] Jarlan23: i was sure they were making it

[0:56:43] AureliusXV: i mean blizzard had all those leaks on mmo to go with
[0:57:24] t0rstin: 4/27/23 too long for my mental health to wait
[0:57:51] dankmeliodas: Like Why would Silvermoon turn into a hostile city that would be super stupid
[0:57:52] Funderik: @AureliusXV you are trying to say blizzard took ideas from the leaks or? your wording is weird.
[0:57:53] LesterLinton: yee a whole year is rough

[0:59:01] captiv8: i'm curious if they will have a new legendary system for this coming xpac?
[0:59:02] Screamnsteam: we said that about bfa going into SL

[1:04:47] Rudric_Ice: The NAME SUCKS DansGame
[1:04:51] Collected1: oh for sure
[1:04:57] Collected1: this isnt accidental
[1:04:59] Shrenko: why @Rudric_Ice ?
[1:05:04] bigoldmeatpie: part of the marketing
[1:05:05] cappei: Yeah, it's clearly iontentional
[1:05:06] Coldfire989: Agreed
[1:05:11] EmpathyLiveChat: It helps to create hype
[1:05:15] LordKain73: I barely hear word about FF14 anymore.  Isn't that mmo supposed to be top dog now? turksKEKW
[1:05:31] pavepawns: i think this leak was abit on purpose to stop the crazy theories and mental fake leaks
[1:05:32] AureliusXV: source code
[1:05:33] Rudric_Ice: @Shrenko  it doesn't have that punch
[1:05:34] dracullus: 9.1 was definitely fuckup, literally everything about WoW leaked back then
[1:05:34] LesterLinton: yee!
[1:05:34] flebbooo: Yeah at some point all these things just line up to good KEKW
[1:05:38] hnti86: pre-planned leak Kappa
[1:05:40] Gurtogg: they do it to buld up gype
[1:05:41] 91Niki: Lore Kappa
[1:05:42] luchion09: theres a moal lol
[1:05:43] Jarlan23: maybe theyre just lazy employees
[1:05:43] Clotic_: Might been junior dev Kappa
[1:05:45] lithium364: yeah the photo was crazy
[1:05:47] Collected1: its to get that hype train rolling
[1:05:47] PaPaBeaRCA: welcome to the internet no one is safe
[1:05:48] Colt_Engineer: I mean that could be true lol
[1:05:49] Djfarmville: inside job Kappa
[1:05:50] Orirholim: @LordKain73 both FFXIV and WoW are the top dogs. Don't think anything even comes close.
[1:05:53] SicariusGTV: it's just the name tho
[1:05:53] nyxcera_art: lol @cappaie
[1:06:02] hnti86: revenge of underpaid intern Kappa
[1:06:13] Shrenko: @Rudric_Ice as long as it has dragons in it, Im hyped!
[1:06:15] Niksen_99: TBC and Wrath was also "leaked"
[1:06:15] 91Niki: You spoken to Lore lately? Kappa
[1:06:25] dracullus: 9.2 wasn't leaked at all
[1:06:28] Trickseynormous: production code definitely gets reviewed before getting pushed out. It would be hard to have that as an accident even once nowadays
[1:06:38] lithium364: the boxcover art was also leaked
[1:06:39] MetalJoshP: Man 4/27/23 is a haul but I rather wait and get a good playable quality expansion than a rushed one and facts they always leak on purpose to test peoples reactions to it
[1:06:39] Gurtogg: box art leaked too
[1:06:40] itsapaul: So what dragonflight is everyone picking? 🤔
[1:06:47] Collected1: the name may have confirmed one of the early MMOC leaks
[1:06:48] szble: Chatting i could think of a better name guys
[1:06:48] thunder993: every hs expansion gets leaked now for 2 years
[1:06:51] laito_: the name sounds weird compared to the previous xpac names
[1:06:56] mozavich: @Itsapaul green for healing
[1:06:57] Reiumi_: "Dragonflight"? What could is mean...monkaHmm
[1:06:58] ConstructedX: we pretty much know its going to be about dragons at this point
[1:06:58] mozavich: ;p
[1:07:02] pavepawns: if anything the fact the name is simply just dragonflight makes me thing they are gonna expand far further then just dragon isles
[1:07:03] cappei: @Itsapaul The one with best DPS
[1:07:04] Dyriks: flying dragons pog
[1:07:04] StoicTaurus: Well... DataMining is old thing. It just spreads to other mediums
[1:07:07] Rudric_Ice: I think they leak it on purpose to get people a bit hyped its not really  surprising  lol
[1:07:11] Broomba: It’s just the name @sicariusgtv lol
[1:07:11] Funderik: the name sets the theme, it's only a part of it, it's the content the matters not the theme and name.
[1:07:14] SensationalBanana: Whiners gon' whine. Can't shit on anything tangible, so they whine about the name. LOL
[1:07:16] MetalJoshP: Towellie spitting facts right now
[1:07:18] hnti86: you will be fighting with dragons as the same states Kappa
[1:07:23] itsapaul: @Cappaie You're not getting taken unless you pick the best movement ability one :P
[1:07:37] hikaritd: 4 27 2023 is fkn unbelievable, the biggest moneymaker is a new expac launch, they wont wait until that LUL
[1:07:38] SicariusGTV: i mean.. every single "leak" has some kind of dragons in it. So atleast for me the name doesn't say much
[1:07:41] ExtremeStorm1: If blizz make a wow 4 i play it again

[1:07:59] Reiumi_: monkaS
[1:08:00] Jenaxia: and its not a aprilfools thing?
[1:08:01] 91Niki: @Towelliee I mean, it could also be a placeholder, right? Technically.
[1:08:02] LesterLinton: hehe
[1:08:02] McLovinYoMuffin: CANT WAIT TO GRIND DRAGONFLIGHT POWER!  At least now I can officially say I’m getting DP’d
[1:08:08] Amarlian: I don't even think you need to even form the foil into a hat
[1:08:09] MetalJoshP: They were hoping someone “finds” it lol
[1:08:16] cappei: @Itsapaul Yeah, I guess I have to pick the Dragon Wing Flap ability to have movement on my DK OMEGALUL
[1:08:27] Shaele: not much to hype for. Sure a new expac about the dragonflight we already new. Before they give some definite news there's no point to go on hopium. @Towelliee :(
[1:08:29] Siven80: Aspect Power, gotta get AP back
[1:08:33] niebvelungen: Comments in a js script KEKW
[1:08:34] szble: the placeholder copium
[1:08:41] Djfarmville: confirmed
[1:08:44] Rudric_Ice: lets go time to grind  Dragonduits
[1:08:45] lithium364: they also datamined the armor Alex is using in the new box cover art
[1:08:48] pavepawns: they wouldnt placehold a dragonrelated expansion when its this high on expectation and not something they would april fools
[1:08:56] hikaritd: @Towelliee Check the MMO Champ leak about it, its freaky similar to this. Name, 4 microclasses..
[1:09:06] 91Niki: I don't think it is a placeholder. Blizzard isn't that smart. But in technical terms companies does do that

[1:09:32] Funderik: well datamining can change at any point. believing only that is foolish
[1:09:33] thunder993: dragon expansion was obvious for months every single leak was dragon related
[1:09:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: How do we know "Dragonflight" isn't the mobile game?
[1:09:54] spookyfacegaming: Idk, they're not smart enough for that. I think this is just a fuck up on their part.
[1:10:03] stresstest: would be great if it was an elaborate misdirection
[1:10:06] dankmeliodas: @milanesa_de_pollo because it says WoW next to it
[1:10:15] sakura_2020: @Towelliee check page 8 on the comments
[1:10:19] dankmeliodas: Mobile would just have Warcraft
[1:10:24] niebvelungen: imagine registering a url for april fools KEKW

[1:11:17] PlotKox: We entered the origins of life. The makers playground. We are prob gonna install the powers of the dsragonflight back to them. And one scenematic will be the son of deathwing becommer a new guardian with restored powers
[1:11:24] Gotxiko: that date is just the expiry of the certificate, they usually last a year
[1:11:26] hikaritd: If they really cut a lot in SL and worked on 10.0 for a while, a late 2022 launch is possible
[1:11:28] szble: yeah wowclassic ones are for wrath
[1:11:29] thunder993: next week PogChamp
[1:11:30] Expanding: That's an SSL Certificate - They tend to expire yearly and have to be renewed
[1:11:35] Expanding: Has nothing to do with release dates
[1:11:38] ttmaker: there is a "leaked" poster alextrazsa
[1:11:42] dracullus: @Towelliee they can't have exact date now
[1:11:44] laito_: me

[1:12:07] captiv8: lol gonna be funny as shit if it is fake
[1:12:08] 91Niki: Oh I'm pretty sure it is it. If not, I 1000% give it to Blizzard, they hardcore played us LUL
[1:12:08] jamarky23: I think they got fed up with all the leaks all the time... This is too obvious. Its not the real expansion
[1:12:09] cappei: Screenshot and datamined Alexstrasza armour
[1:12:09] Orirholim: 100% legit I think
[1:12:10] AureliusXV: its in commnets
[1:12:11] DeanoTV: on icy veins
[1:12:12] BardTaleDelight: My stance is. if people think botting is bad on a PC platform, imagine the amount of botting if WoW was made to include a mobile platform :P
[1:12:15] adamg46: i dont think they're trolling cause people want dragons so for it not to be dragons would be a mistake
[1:12:15] deathrisear97: icy veins
[1:12:16] fewyn: @Towelliee https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPYNHlnXIAk7DFT.jpg

[1:12:38] shanks_blank: @Towelliee do you think there will be a new class ?
[1:12:38] Jarlan23: they covered up my dragon mommy tho
[1:12:39] 91Niki: SUS
[1:12:43] laito_: also this art is unique
[1:12:43] Niksen_99: Looks like shadowlands LUL
[1:12:45] Colt_Engineer: kinda sus
[1:12:46] fewyn: it does not look shopped
[1:12:46] Shrenko: very sus indeed
[1:12:47] MetalJoshP: Yea facts I think they pretty much know they need to be straight up with the community this time and on top of all information and PR after the last two expansions and the controversies just need to be polished in every aspect
[1:12:47] Spaede: I think blizz is genius for this, gonna build so much hype for the announcement
[1:12:49] Rictue: this artstyle is different than wow's art style but its cool i wish its true
[1:12:58] PaPaBeaRCA: pissed off intern that did not get his raise
[1:13:00] PlotKox: late aprils fools :D

[1:13:15] Gurtogg: @Towelliee her gear was datamined in 9.2.5 last week
[1:13:15] 91Niki: Yeah it looks legit, BUT someone could also just create that, if an artist, print it out and put it on a wall and take a picture
[1:13:16] lithium364: on ptr
[1:13:18] cappei: Alextrasza
[1:13:18] Gotxiko: onyxia?
[1:13:18] Ralvay: they don't need hype I guess.. everytime we see the beautiful expansion trailer we all buy it. they do that very well.
[1:13:19] MVRD: cant wait to re-re-kill onyxia for the third time
[1:13:19] bigpppower527: i think having chill base expansion over some InterGalactical universe BS is a good think, we dont need to have a main bad guy worse than the other. imo
[1:13:19] dankmeliodas: You could tell easily
[1:13:20] dranet11: that's alexstrasza
[1:13:21] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: onyxia

[1:14:18] hikaritd: a janitor Kappa
[1:14:19] lithium364: 3rd party,

[1:14:21] Rictue: leak is intentional
[1:14:24] PaPaBeaRCA: or somebody just took it

[1:14:38] UniquePerson08: its intentional cause the moniter is turned off

[1:15:57] Dinermoe: what was his video about?
[1:15:58] Niksen_99: Dragon expansion sounds sick tho @Towelliee
[1:15:59] 91Niki: @Towelliee Just take into consideration tho, if you're a good enough artist, you can make this art, print it out and say it's taken at the Blizzard office. I'm not saying it is, it probably is legit. But it can also be done if you want.
[1:16:08] ttmaker: she looks cool there
[1:16:10] Amarlian: pirate dragon picture?
[1:16:23] Reiumi_: 🐉?

[1:16:52] howlingstorms: dont u already know what it is :) @Towelliee
[1:16:54] fcwar_: @Towelliee The picture surfaced nearly an hour before the certs
[1:16:59] Droxous: it was before
[1:17:10] laito_: That might be some very early concept art
[1:17:13] Collected1: what about the MMOC leak that got this title and dark rangers right
[1:17:16] Dinermoe: so 11 months, ye? YEP
[1:17:17] Hazno: @Towelliee you are blowing harshly into your mic when you say the letter P btw, sounds like you're missing a pop filter
[1:17:18] Jarlan23: so if his leak is true then does that big leak on mmo champion talking about dragonflight stuff a couple months ago need new consideration ?
[1:17:19] fewyn: ready for a meaningful choice @Towelliee ?
[1:17:20] BoezIRL: still doing something like that in so few hours I don't think it's possible
[1:17:23] ILikeKillTheZombies: in my opinion, covered alextrasza makes it legit.
[1:17:24] pacificmc1: Rise of the Aspects is a better name :)
[1:17:24] wreckshoptv: turn into a dragon
[1:17:24] UlsterFarl: They need to to make a dragon waifu dating sim mechanic for this expansions.  That will gaurantee the subs

[1:18:01] dankmeliodas: I hope they wouldn’t make the same mistake that they did with covenants
[1:18:02] 91Niki: I'm sure it's legit, but I won't jump in with both legs until it's confirmed
[1:18:05] VARlATlON: OR we gonna try it again KEKW
[1:18:05] EscapePlan01: some crt's are still used for colour printing/design aren't they?
[1:18:06] Orirholim: Blizzard is giving us the D for next expansion.
[1:18:09] hikaritd: "this time for sure" COPIUM
[1:18:10] Gotxiko: if they make dragonflights reputations with a convenant-like progression system, and not being locked, it could be nice
[1:18:14] kharnij83: gonna pull a George RR Martin shit and refuse to make the expansion cause people figured it out
[1:18:15] Colt_Engineer: after the ripcord pulled it's fine actually

[1:43:35] Ralvay: orcs begin the live in stormwind.. why not
[1:43:36] Lesliech0w: It ain't Deathwing revived it's Galakrond
[1:43:40] Zettabyte: Did you just leak the whole expac @Towelliee? #HeKnows Kappa
[1:43:42] Hamsubob: Why don't you play lost ark? :tf:
[1:43:43] sinlesssinner: @Slyjmio no leveling... are you on crack? :) its an MMO, no leveling means it aint an mmo no more
[1:43:43] bigb0omer: wonder if the horde will still be called the horde same with alliance since we are coming together
[1:43:54] Folgrum: i hope no tinker class, but would love spellbreaker, blademaster - both mail class, both with tank spec and 2 dps. spellbreaker tank would be so cool with a shield
[1:43:55] adrian_fell: @sinlesssinner then im on crack.
[1:43:58] PotbellyGoat: towHAMUP
[1:43:59] Gurtogg: legendary cape that will let you fly
[1:44:03] c0mmander_starscream: c0mmander_starscream subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! towWipe
[1:44:06] AureliusXV: champions
[1:44:07] spookyfacegaming: Just focus one one damn thing and have the side stories be minor stuff i.e. not light vs. void because that is too big.
[1:44:09] adrian_fell: @sinlesssinner want some?
[1:44:09] Nethil: Hordliance
[1:44:10] Exoduc: When all the old gods die they unite in death and create super old god que 10.0
[1:44:11] sinlesssinner: @Slyjmio haha
[1:44:14] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee We will choose dragonflights like covenants Kappa
[1:44:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, they said that basically they are keeping the main factions
[1:44:22] Reiumi_: call them World Defense
[1:44:24] mavericks312: xfaction guilds ftw
[1:44:24] mkarapinar: !wow10
[1:44:25] Moobot: @mkarapinar World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[1:44:28] sinlesssinner: @Slyjmio nah bro, i enjoy having teeth
[1:44:31] hnti86: Hordaience Kappa
[1:44:37] Malarick: do we get the Alliance Civil war in Dragonflight?
[1:44:41] Alegnowar: morgan said in the interview the term "alliances" so he might have leaked the new cross-faction related name already
[1:44:44] PotbellyGoat: it will be interesting to see WoW transition to whatever they want the game to be in 10.0
[1:44:44] Lesliech0w: What is Wrathion going to do without his boyfriend?
[1:44:47] thecynicalshuffler: we're gonna share a coke and a smile...   just like richard pryor said..  its beautiful... lol
[1:44:50] Niksen_99: Do you think faction balance would be better if blizzard removed racials
[1:44:54] Rudric_Ice: will you play alliance in 9.2.5 ?
[1:44:54] LesterLinton: ohhhh
[1:45:01] fcwar_: I think Zereth Mortis is a good implication on them removing leveling. Zereth Mortis is the 1st expansion patch where questing greens replace some current-expansion raid gear.
[1:45:16] Ivarjaws: !wow10

[1:45:22] barry_ow2: i think that blizzard will still surprise us like every time - leaks for a new expansion come out and they release something totally different
[1:45:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: Lok'tar ogar! SMOrc
[1:45:24] pacificmc1: @cannotevenrightnow lol no it isn't
[1:45:29] yaellian: Sadge Alliance Sadge
[1:45:29] bowsers1: D:
[1:45:32] mavericks312: horde still has the cooler races
[1:45:35] Gurtogg: cuz alliance > horde
[1:45:36] AureliusXV: alliance is uperior
[1:45:40] fcwar_: @pacificmc1 It is, yep
[1:45:41] AureliusXV: superior
[1:45:41] Shrenko: Alliance races > Horde races
[1:45:45] sinlesssinner: but what about anduin bro? if we get an expansion w/o him to annoy us, would be great!! @Towelliee
[1:45:45] pacificmc1: @cannotevenrightnow nope
[1:45:48] flebbooo: I just facttion changed back to ally, sorry my SMOrc brothers
[1:45:52] bowsers1: Alliance is betterEZ
[1:45:58] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: crossfaction is one of the best things they have done in years
[1:45:59] Gotxiko: clipping KEKW
[1:46:01] simonbgg: Dwarf master race > ALL
[1:46:06] bowsers1: gg
[1:46:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Remaking the Undercity could be a real win for them. It can be amazing
[1:46:13] LesterLinton: does that one fly
[1:46:19] fcwar_: @pacificmc1 Please tell me a patch where greens patch questing greens replaced current-expansion raid epics
[1:46:21] subversv: now you gotta find the patterns
[1:46:34] Shrenko: yes, they are easy to get
[1:46:34] ScurvyHyam: You can find them
[1:46:35] PaPaBeaRCA: Kodah!!
[1:46:35] akia03: dont forget to get the treasure in the room
[1:46:37] pacificmc1: @cannotevenrightnow pretty much every expansion since MOP
[1:46:37] Zavier420: Towelliee is an Alliance traitor lol
[1:46:38] Alegnowar: u need to unlock them, the addon tells u where they are
[1:46:39] nezz231: now the real game begin
[1:46:45] wookieewonkah: In the Morgan Day interview about the race to world first, he was talking about guilds and called them a different name, possible name change for cross faction guilds?
[1:46:47] subversv: ive made like 8 mounts its fun actually lol
[1:46:55] Skycoh: hey, @Towelliee - love you bro.
[1:46:56] jasonbriggs: all the top guilds play horde
[1:46:59] szble: cross faction is great
[1:47:04] fcwar_: @pacificmc1 You're wrong lol. Go look it up as I did, instead of talking out ur ass
[1:47:15] pacificmc1: @cannotevenrightnow you're wrong, sit down and be quiet
[1:47:21] Voltaictv: Taliesin was thinking Galakrond would get ressurected from his burial ground in Dragonblight
[1:47:23] AureliusXV: all the top guilds went horde in legio then all the sheep followed them
[1:47:27] LesterLinton: hahaha
[1:47:33] Reiumi_: cult of light monkaS
[1:47:34] flebbooo: Have u heard of our lord and savior the light?
[1:47:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Alliance meltdown sounds fun to me
[1:47:42] banishtyrion: do you have 5 minutes to discuss our lord and savior Xzera ?
[1:47:48] pacificmc1: Galakrond resurrection would be nice
[1:47:56] dracullus: cross faction won't harm Horde vs Ally, I think it will even make war mode more even and fun
[1:47:57] spookyfacegaming: would be cool to have Yrel back now that she's nuts from the light.
[1:47:58] banishtyrion: or X'era :P
[1:48:03] XGhostshade: light cult
[1:48:09] dracullus: they just need think of better rewards for war mode
[1:48:11] fcwar_: @pacificmc1 So you mean resources such as WoWwikis and such are incorrect? Interesting
[1:48:12] Malarick: Turalyon here to save us from the Void.  Go Light!!
[1:48:14] bowsers1: 10.0 cinematic = galakrond resurrection Kappa
[1:48:16] Sylphy_TV: Game of Stormwid and the mud-hut bois SMOrc
[1:48:24] pacificmc1: @cannotevenrightnow link then :)
[1:48:28] Skycoh: cataclysm 2
[1:48:33] szble: maybe neutral lordaeron
[1:48:48] laito_: @brakzakk I bet its gonna be something like that
[1:48:50] Aquadriel: cross faction garrison erp finally!!
[1:48:52] adrian_fell: can you go to stormwind?
[1:49:00] Gurtogg: poor yrel, first the colliseum and now this

[1:49:35] bigb0omer: what an awesome addon

[1:50:01] DragonofWolves: @aquadriel not the point damn it
[1:50:05] mizuryo: i just hope blizzard will not be "busy" fixing bugs with cross faction and wont have time / cut content / mess up balancing or raids etc
[1:50:18] Reiumi_: "called it" Pepega
[1:50:19] skittleguzzler: literal heroes
[1:50:32] adrian_fell: i mean what else is there to guess at this point LUL
[1:50:34] generaljosh721: "I have a super power"
[1:50:37] BubblePriest: during a time when Dungeons and Dragons is at an all time high hype
[1:50:38] pavepawns: guys my prediction of Rise of ancient empire aspect dragons on mmochampion is clearly proven right now
[1:50:42] xkremuh: You said long ago you thought this expansion was gonna be different, you still think so?
[1:50:45] akia03: the one in the room that started the mount quest
[1:50:45] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think the raids will be fine, that's the most important thing to them
[1:50:48] BubblePriest: "I'm an empath."
[1:50:48] barry_ow2: I still think that blizzard will surprise us like every time - leaks come out and they release something totally different
[1:50:53] BubblePriest: LUL
[1:50:56] 91Niki: "I can predict the future GAIS sacTIMMY towTinfoil "
[1:50:57] DragonofWolves: towelliee I think this would be the first expac you didn't predict the name of or did you?
[1:51:01] Porcos_Voadores: @Towelliee what are the chances do you think we have in having a new class?
[1:51:05] lithium364: the cinematic will open with wrathion seducing anduin
[1:51:07] pacificmc1: @cannotevenrightnow yeah didnt tthink so
[1:51:12] d2darkalliance: @towelliee my personal guess is dragonblight name leak is for Classic northrend release

[1:51:26] LesterLinton: don't say that :(
[1:51:33] bekindtoeachothr: I just hope they take some risks with it. Ubalanced is ok as long as its fun
[1:51:35] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[1:51:36] akia03: the treasure is called architect reserve
[1:51:37] generaljosh721: As much as I want a new class.. I don't think Blizzard is in the position to add a new class
[1:51:46] Collected1: i'll take class skins like dark ranger
[1:51:47] Screamnsteam: would be so hard to introduce another class and balance it
[1:51:50] szble: dan i hope so
[1:51:51] K0rzak0v: And then less borrowed power please
[1:51:54] DeanoTV: we need a new class or spec its been too long
[1:52:06] TheItalianStallion321: we need a new class i disagree with you. we need something new to play with
[1:52:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Single spec classes sound weak, but if they do a full class it could be really good
[1:52:08] xkremuh: 100%.
[1:52:11] LesterLinton: but mech suits like pocopoc
[1:52:13] spookyfacegaming: I think the furthest they'll go is class skins i.e dark rangers that alter the appearance of spells and such but no new class.
[1:52:14] nezz231: @DeanoTV we really dont
[1:52:15] cappei: They should introduce a new class. Expansions with new classes are typically the ones that most people praise for the best class design. It simply puts the most attention on overall class design
[1:52:18] xkremuh: @TheItalianStallion321 lolll
[1:52:19] futomara01: omfg who gives a shit about balance
[1:52:19] Lesliech0w: "The Beta for Dragonflight continues!" past release.... they can't afford another of these debacles where the Expac is unfinished
[1:52:24] generaljosh721: It would be interesting for them to do a class rotation.. like get rid of half of the classes and revamp them completely from the ground up
[1:52:29] DragonofWolves: We need another hero class. we only have two
[1:52:30] Tyrammus84: @Towelliee if they do, do another class I hope its a mail wearer
[1:52:31] pavepawns: can we one day just have a crazy long expansion title?
[1:52:32] Night_Crawlerz: a summoner class... oh wait, we have the demo lock
[1:52:32] LightBladeStream: A new class makes feral druid even more dead KEKW

[1:52:40] DeanoTV: i've played most of the dps classes throughout the years, most of them are boring imo
[1:52:42] chippchappi: would be cool to get new specs for spellcaster monk or other
[1:52:51] BubblePriest: balanace if for the high end players, if they want average joe a new class might be the pick
[1:52:51] laito_: Is feral druid still a thing ? KEKW
[1:52:53] akia03: its straight ahead of you the locked door with teleporter next to it
[1:52:58] Bacanu34: it wos close to you KEKW
[1:53:06] Alegnowar: u spawn right behind anyway
[1:53:08] Lesliech0w: As long as they delete Melee Survival, I'd be happier.
[1:53:12] Vexxsis: @towelliee think the rumors are true that wow will have a new race that's half dragon, like the ff14 race
[1:53:14] akia03: no the other room where this quest started
[1:53:16] mavericks312: just trade in hunters and monks for dark rangers
[1:53:31] sile_tv: @towelliee i saw you before but never watched your stream but now i understand why so many people love you man. Your consistency and quality is huge.
[1:53:31] akia03: otherside of this desert bit
[1:53:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think we've seen with Demon Hunter that two spec classes can be okay, but really having three is better for the players to have options

[1:53:52] LesterLinton: @Towelliee do you have a #1 thing that 10.0 needs to have?
[1:53:55] BubblePriest: abandon it and never look back
[1:53:57] bekindtoeachothr: Id love for them to remove meters then people may be able to play more then the meta builds opening up variety
[1:54:04] akia03: this door
[1:54:14] xrandomdoodx: @Towelliee I really hope they do big class reworks and use this expansion as a chance to make all talents and specs strong and viable. I really liked the old philosophy of bring the player not the class lol
[1:54:16] akia03: yep
[1:54:22] Reckless_Monk: yee
[1:54:33] pavepawns: pocopoc is a dreadlord?!??!?!
[1:54:36] Lesliech0w: They could try to remove meters, but people will find a way around that shit
[1:54:40] mavericks312: player not the class is dead
[1:54:48] DeanoTV: i've played most of the dps classes throughout the years, most of them are boring imo, they need something new or reworks
[1:55:00] laito_: I swear they need to make classes similar to their pre legion versions
[1:55:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: A lot of time, yes
[1:55:04] ashwing_: When has that been actual?
[1:55:14] pavepawns: i cant wait to do iron docks
[1:55:16] LesterLinton: yee
[1:55:24] 91Niki: Yeeaaah, equally balancing all classes and specs are never ever gonna happen
[1:55:26] Jarlan23: all i want then to do is get rid of dead talents that no one uses and replace them with something interesting
[1:55:40] raye_gaming22: wrath is comming q4 so they dont have to worrie
[1:55:48] lithium364: get rid of 3 button rotations
[1:55:51] falldrgn: Bringing the player, not the class is true for like 95% of the population. but everyone looks at what echo and liquid and method are doing
[1:55:52] K0rzak0v: they will get rid of current  tier sets, i cant believe they keep them
[1:55:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: 36 specs, trying to balance all that is a mountain
[1:56:03] zigzugg: they bring back major and minor glyphs
[1:56:05] akia03: even with new talents you still go with the best ones so nothing changes really
[1:56:06] Lesliech0w: can't wait to farm some borrowed power and/or the currency for it again
[1:56:09] adrian_fell: blizzard is just too comfy with the talents on all the classes , why reinvent the wheel? just focus on the gameplay i guess
[1:56:15] pavepawns: i like my 3 buttons D;
[1:56:19] voceyxo: leave my dh alone
[1:56:19] Funderik: players want so much to change and so many new things they forget it takes time, if we got everything, we would get 10.0 in 2030
[1:56:21] spookyfacegaming: I wonder how they will design classes around not having the covenant abilities and conduits anymore. Maybe bake some things into the spells they enhanced with conduits.
[1:56:21] hnti86: just add Dragon/Draconic- prefix to all abilities Kappa
[1:56:23] bekindtoeachothr: 3 butttons fits better on phone screen....
[1:56:23] cappei: If 90% of specs couldn't be a boring builder spender in a different skin that'd be fantastic 4Head
[1:56:30] generaljosh721: i miss the days that i could literally create a macro that did all of my dps lmao
[1:56:30] KythosMeltdown: i just like having a shitton of moves like Rift, SWTOR or EQ
[1:56:31] mavericks312: as long as mages are the main character 3 button rotations are here to stay stop It
[1:56:40] SpenceSir: Just play black mage in ffxiv if you wanna complex rotation LUL
[1:56:42] c0mmander_starscream: "Whats eh button"
[1:56:45] 91Niki: Not complex and hard, just not 3 button snooze fest either
[1:56:45] Reckless_Monk: FF14 has some dump rotationd man
[1:56:46] Jokervenom1978: Im a BM main. i LIKE simple rotation.
[1:56:47] Mystic_Bard: @Towelliee  mrgm video seems to be back
[1:56:50] Jarlan23: ff14 has like 25 buttons to press and yet the combat in that game feels a lot easier than WoWs
[1:56:53] crrdsh: didn't know about the mobile.
[1:56:54] Orirholim: @JoshiPooh Gnome Sequencer addon will do that for you
[1:56:57] crrdsh: I'm interested!
[1:56:58] adrian_fell: wow rotations were never complex it was just filled with a much bigger kit of utility etc, like distracting shot for hunters
[1:56:58] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: thinking it will be wow mobile and not warcraft mobile slootI slootCopium
[1:56:59] Lesliech0w: Heart of Aspects LUL
[1:57:00] c0mmander_starscream: Star Craft 3 towLets towGo
[1:57:02] K0rzak0v: talking about 3 button rotation.. meanwhile they cant keep up their 3 frezy stacks
[1:57:03] Gimplock: @Towelliee problem is when thay implement a system thay dont follow up with it and update it like garison
[1:57:08] lithium364: bring back gladiator warrior pog
[1:57:13] 91Niki: I don't find anything rewarding by pressing 3 buttons and topping meters.
[1:57:17] akia03: just ask survival hunter how great spec reworks are
[1:57:23] 20secgaming: bring back tree talent
[1:57:36] Lesliech0w: Delete Surv, bring back MoP spec
[1:57:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: A shrug is not a "no" lol
[1:57:41] c0mmander_starscream: Ion is still on his coke binges
[1:57:43] Reiumi_: Ion comes knocking on the door monkaS
[1:57:47] falldrgn: @akia03 it was good, and a needed change, just took longer to get it tuned right
[1:57:48] MadWolf1290: that 1) it was real and 2) is FAIR GAME BOIS
[1:57:49] Orirholim: as long as they don't make combat slow like FFXIV i'm down for whatever
[1:58:04] SensationalBanana: If they reverted Survival to what it was in MoP I'd be the happiest person alive.
[1:58:06] laito_: If a rotation is complex its fun to me
[1:58:08] SpyCrabbo: @91Niki #humblebrag
[1:58:12] KythosMeltdown: ff combat isnt slow reee
[1:58:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: They could increase the GCD, but WoW players would spaz
[1:58:26] nezz231: @SensationalBanana  same
[1:58:40] lithium364: increase base movement speed by 50% kekw
[1:58:43] Lesliech0w: "FF combat is slow" says pleb that never leveled past 50.
[1:58:47] laito_: Sadge
[1:58:55] generaljosh721: just make classes interchangeable.. blizz can't balance them so just let the players balance them for you
[1:58:59] pavepawns: for me id like 3-4 main buttons and them working together
[1:59:00] akia03: complex rotations are nice if you dont have to move every second
[1:59:00] michaisn: I think there should be a class for everyone
[1:59:01] hnti86: 1 button rotation LUL
[1:59:02] 91Niki: Yeah we don't need complex, we just don't need brain dead easy either. A good in between
[1:59:05] KythosMeltdown: bring back tbc rotations kekw
[1:59:06] K0rzak0v: true that lol
[1:59:08] LightBladeStream: That's what talents are for, choosing your own rotation by adding or removing complexity
[1:59:11] dracullus: classes and combat are definetely not most glaring issues of current wow
[1:59:14] xkremuh: Rotation difficulty is fine, what is not fine is WORLD's difficulty imho
[1:59:19] ijuki: @Lesliech0w It is slow, even at max level... just stop Kappa
[1:59:25] Layercake: HahaThink

[1:59:29] futomara01: big numbers=best
[1:59:30] dwolf010: @Lesliech0w thats bc its you get borred to dead trying to level past 50 lol
[1:59:35] Orirholim: @ijuki still slow at max level
[1:59:38] SpenceSir: Towelliee is right as always

[2:00:21] bekindtoeachothr: hmm which xpac had the most complicated rotations?  BC maybe?
[2:00:23] mystlineid: not even w1 players dont care for hard rotations  the only ones that say that they like or want hard rotation are some sweatlords trying to get some internet points by saying hey look at my moonlight sonata rotation
[2:00:23] theos666: Like rogues, I'm leveling one, sub has 10 spells in rotation
[2:00:25] Porcos_Voadores: we all know that  they should do small rotations to port it to ps5 and xbox controllers
[2:00:25] PotbellyGoat: that's probably why Lost Ark has 8
[2:00:26] Amarlian: I agree, people seem to like fewer buttons in a main rotation but with situational buttons on the side @Towelliee
[2:00:32] falldrgn: FF use to be super complex.. with cross class abilities.. etc
[2:00:43] PoppaMetal: i say 5 bvuttons dmg and 6 or 6 utility/situational
[2:00:51] rubberduckie0_0: i like to push pyroblast
[2:00:52] PoppaMetal: 5 or 6*

[2:00:55] Gotxiko: ffxiv 2min openers KEKW
[2:00:56] Sicknessqt: KEKW
[2:00:59] steviestayhigh: i have never played wow i thought you had to press like 15 buttons
[2:01:06] generaljosh721: I still think the dragonflight mentions in the code is some random team at Blizzard playing an april fools prank. Even though the code came out after April 1st.. being a dev myself.. it's very possible they planned on it going out on Apr 1 but something delayed it and they had to roll it out late.
[2:01:09] Senthius09: "here is the second keyboard i need to play this rotation since all my abilities wont fit on the first one"
[2:01:14] razerznuffy: Windwalker mastery is super fun for me, you can't press the same button twice in a row
[2:01:19] Sarocus: Dont really get why anyone wants a rotation anyway. Only makes it boring to press the same sequence over and over again
[2:01:21] jeflag: look ma, no hands
[2:01:29] laito_: Back in MoP u probably had to press 15 buttons
[2:01:31] Gotxiko: 2 full bars is all you shoudl need for all your shit
[2:01:38] adrian_fell: Wow rotation complexity peaked in MoP for most classes
[2:01:41] Gremmel: Yep, easy rotation but deep toolkit makes for the best game experience. SWTOR boring, Vanilla WoW fun
[2:01:46] skittleguzzler: Lotta the abilities are super situational
[2:01:46] BeeXrr: is enhance dead in shadowlands still?
[2:01:48] Amarlian: @razerznuffy windwalker feels to me like if you like street fighter as a class. it's great
[2:01:51] Lesliech0w: main abilities > standard keys.. then Alt+ modifiers for extra shit
[2:01:53] LightBladeStream: @Slyjmio Yeah, Demo lock was insane

[2:02:09] jmalmin: It depends on what class you play. Some got few buttons to press... other classes Afflction warlock you got allot off buttons to press :)
[2:02:12] LesterLinton: @BeeXrr enchance shaman wrecks stuff
[2:02:13] generaljosh721: it's easy to create a DNS record

[2:02:25] Gurtogg: its not an expac date lol
[2:02:32] notviable_: the release date in your title isnt correct its just SSL cert expiration dates my man
[2:02:36] Armdel: think its more likely they intentionally did it to start building hype

[2:02:58] Mandrakey: Its so weird to deploy un-minified JS
[2:02:59] Sarocus: Really doesnt look like Blizz' style of joke
[2:03:06] Syllvn: you also don't fake leak a name everyone is expecting. it will only sour people's expectations of the actual one

[2:03:20] LekeroleN: tell you next year Kappa
[2:03:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The name Dragonflight could be a placeholder, but I do think it is likely something similar....maybe Rise of the Aspects or Return of the Dragons or something
[2:03:24] cappei: It's actually an early april fools for 2023 when we still don't have the expansion released OMEGALUL

[2:05:57] paperbirdd: with S4 for shadowlands i feel they wanted to be safe with this one though so i feel Q1 for new xpac
[2:06:18] Saikwondo: Lets think for a min, assuming we possibly be going back to a time when Galakrond was a thing, does that not mean almost every enemy we've defeated in the game will either be back alive or not even born yet?
[2:06:19] Gurtogg: better not lol
[2:06:25] Thoreya: I dig the expansion name
[2:06:29] laito_: If galakrond shows up itll be so cool
[2:06:30] freejam013: I'd say next expac once the microsoft acquisition settles in and they figure our a rhytm
[2:06:30] Reckless_Monk: sheeesh hope not
[2:06:34] Sttarrkz: all the shadowlands delaying, and what do we get an expension which seems not even finished after years xd
[2:06:34] KythosMeltdown: well have wrath classic in the meantime

[2:06:56] dalvynthedrunk: My friends: "dude it doesnt take anything to get you back hype for wow" Me: "shutup thats not true" *Dragonflight name released* me: "Oh shit this is the best expansion WoW has ever made"
[2:06:59] Rudric_Ice: its another WoD tho
[2:07:01] Senthius09: i like fighting dragons
[2:07:01] falldrgn: but.. didn't the dragon flights lose their power at the end of Cata?
[2:07:05] Senthius09: dragon fights are fun
[2:07:11] DragonofWolves: well considering my Chinese zodiac is a dragon
[2:07:15] Buckwink: SL was WoD 2.0 so Dragonflight will be Legion 2.0 POGGERS
[2:07:16] generaljosh721: Not to mention.. the javascript where "Dragonflight" was found was located within JS controlled by "Optimizely" which is a SAAS product used for A/B testing features on a site. So all of that code is behind an A/B test which makes sense because they can toggle it on/off whenever they want but it seems like a pretty big error for them to roll it out early if they already rolled it back? Or has it not been rolled back yet?
[2:07:16] Melgor101: LUL
[2:07:19] adrian_fell: "Return of the Dragonflights" sounds like a star wars title
[2:07:23] LesterLinton: dragons is more fantasy to me than fighting 'the 1st ones'
[2:07:25] subversv: the return of the dragons, dawn of the dragons
[2:07:27] Lesliech0w: Danuser: and I made these dragons robots now.

[2:08:04] lithium364: The Return of Afrasiabi MonkaS
[2:08:05] IVJamieIV: Surely the addition of this information to the site is because they're planning to roll out pre-orders for the expansion very soon after the announcement?
[2:08:05] LesterLinton: do we have anyclues who the bad guy would be yet?
[2:08:06] dalvynthedrunk: The only expansion name I dont like was Battle for Azeroth, sounds stupid
[2:08:08] zigzugg: wrathion gonna give us another legandary cloak...
[2:08:11] szble: im sure itll include cosmic stuff eventually
[2:08:11] adrian_fell: Cataclysm, Shadowlands, Legion , Dragonflight :)
[2:08:14] Bentzer87: @Towelliee It would been better if Dragon Isle would had been released 2024 instead as it is the year of Dragon.
[2:08:26] jmalmin: I want new bad guys :) something fresh

[2:12:42] Senthius09: "level up your Heart of the Aspect Cloak by collecting aspect power from various activities"
[2:12:48] DragonofWolves: You think you do but you don't!
[2:12:49] CipansR_Ayaya: 6 new covenents in dragonfligh expansion
[2:12:49] gravlaxxx: Can't wait for torghast 2.0
[2:13:03] kranztheman: !WOW10
[2:13:03] Donswag3: I really hope they do incorporate these covenant abilities into the game somehow.. some classes became so dependent on their abilities that theyd need to be reworked essentially if theyre removed
[2:13:04] Moobot: @kranztheman World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[2:13:04] Amarlian: I would rather have covenants 2.0 over Azerite gear 2.0
[2:13:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Pirate dragons!
[2:13:05] Melgor101: new staff
[2:13:07] ahies28: systems of dragonflight
[2:13:09] falldrgn: @Amarlian They will go away or be reworked into existing talents
[2:13:12] Armdel: we can fight onyxia for the 4th time
[2:13:16] Aypex01: Wait do you guys not have phones?
[2:13:16] dalvynthedrunk: I love how I just had a dragon expansion in gw2 and now im getting one for WoW. I'm getting Dragon overload over here
[2:13:17] LesterLinton: isn't galakrond enourmous, that'd be badass for a cinematic him rising up
[2:13:17] LightBladeStream: New covenants for each dragonflight, calling it now LuL
[2:13:19] mystlineid: pirate dragons you say?
[2:13:20] SuperTech_: You can rope those birds while mounted in the air
[2:13:24] EscapePlan01: "you think you know what you want, but you dont"
[2:13:26] Jinjurikicb: tazavesh drop is soo dope
[2:13:29] sorrowfulgoose: !WOW10
[2:13:32] pavepawns: can we ride khadgar?
[2:13:36] DragonofWolves: if they name a pirate dragon after jack sparrow..
[2:13:39] ClassicMalcontent: @Amarlian same thing they always do in the modern WoW. They go away and you start working on new ones. "Borrowed Power" modern WoW concept.
[2:13:40] Jinjurikicb: love that dragon boss
[2:13:42] Lesliech0w: "farm this currency to empower your new dragon ally." zzz
[2:13:46] paperbirdd: @Amarlian probably same thing with azerite powers and artifacts, either scrapped, baked, or talents
[2:13:46] zigzugg: zen flright?
[2:13:48] Djfarmville: worked for me wtf
[2:13:52] szble: you have to be close
[2:13:52] Amarlian: @Amarlian I assume this too since they did that with the Legion weapons. just curious
[2:13:56] PaPaBeaRCA: having benedict cumberbatch doing the dragon voice in the cinematic
[2:13:57] Minobard: can wait to farm DP.
[2:13:57] SuperTech_: No a hunter nad it does not dismount me
[2:14:02] Minobard: cant*
[2:14:02] LordVader83: worked for me on a lock
[2:14:04] bigb0omer: maybe it will be the reward for keystone master of season 4
[2:14:11] dalvynthedrunk: "COLLECT ASPECT POWER TO POWER UP YOUR HORN OF THE ASPECS HELMET"
[2:14:12] nezz231: worked for me aswell
[2:14:22] IVJamieIV: @Towelliee I dunno, I feel they really need to work on their story and lore more for the game to be 'gold' I think this expansion is a perfect example of how good raids don't carry the game because the story has taken a horrible dive.
[2:14:30] szble: participation trophy
[2:14:30] cerealkillas22: I want the slime kitty for S4 mount
[2:14:30] Lesliech0w: Hunters taming dragons finally... would produce a ton of sticky keyboards
[2:14:38] cerealkillas22: or a purple version of the KSM mounts
[2:14:39] Bacanu34: a dragon mount for ksm
[2:14:43] DragonofWolves: @papabearca they can't pay Benedict enough for that
[2:14:48] laito_: The Chinese guy who predicted 10.0 to be related to dragons back in 2017 also said 11.0 was gonna be related to Elemental lords
[2:14:51] Shrenko: I dont
[2:14:52] paperbirdd: i could not care less about the story
[2:14:52] dalvynthedrunk: Yeah but a lottt of people do
[2:14:52] adrian_fell: YEP
[2:14:55] Buckwink: a lot of people dont because its dogshit lol
[2:14:56] raye_gaming22: a blue elemental mount you head it here first for season 5
[2:14:57] chirsen: i do care too
[2:15:02] Scoodles91: expansion died cause there was no loot :D
[2:15:05] Whiskeypal_eu: cinematics are nice tho
[2:15:05] SmokedHog: you'll be able to morph into a dragon and fly in the next expac
[2:15:06] CipansR_Ayaya: I cared
[2:15:07] Nutsy: True. MMOs should not be game of thrones. LORE>STORY
[2:15:08] Thugis123: I just want to kill stuff and enjoy my class
[2:15:09] Vysa: i dont care i just want my class to feel good
[2:15:10] Nebulizer87: i think we have learned their storytelling is lacking just give us a better game
[2:15:11] Jarlan23: I love stories and lore in other games but i've never cared about WoWs story because it's never ever been told well
[2:15:13] Shrenko: well I kinda care, but I stop caring when its bad
[2:15:13] PaPaBeaRCA: @dragonofwolves indeed but it would be pretty dope eh!
[2:15:13] mavericks312: 9 out of 10 players don't care about the story and just rush to end game for the raids
[2:15:15] dalvynthedrunk: Like people get hype as hell over story, like that is why the SL cinematic was so controversial
[2:15:17] caboose1029: been playing the game since the start and the story is pretty low on my list of things i care about
[2:15:17] Bugman613: I care about the story, but your right most people dont.
[2:15:20] KonradGM: curious how it diverges trough hardcore/casual audience, like if casuals are more likely to stop playing due to story etc
[2:15:20] PotbellyGoat: G spamming in Lost Ark
[2:15:24] Layercake: Blizzard force people to stop caring about the story
[2:15:25] PidiaP: More people don’t care about the story than people that do for sure
[2:15:26] Amarlian: @ClassicMalcontent I am partly hoping they roll some into the talents like they did for legion
[2:15:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah most WoW players don't care about the story much
[2:15:30] Sandisy: gameplay is for the entire duration of the game. story is interesting for a bit
[2:15:37] cerealkillas22: I know all the story and lore, but i truly play for the gameplay
[2:15:39] dankmeliodas: The lore community it’s pretty big
[2:15:42] dracullus: @Towelliee I treat WoW story like Dragon Ball, it's cool but very stupid and always was this way
[2:15:43] Scorpionlaw: Yes
[2:15:49] Scorpionlaw: 100% yes
[2:15:50] mavericks312: great raids > lore
[2:15:52] HiiPPii: yes plz
[2:15:55] PaPaBeaRCA: @dragonofwolves he did a pretty killer job with smog
[2:15:55] LesterLinton: and cool armor to look cool while doing it
[2:15:56] Nebulizer87: i still say we should be getting new dungeons every patch drop imo
[2:15:58] 1s2real: Transmogs and mount brother
[2:15:59] chirsen: @cerealkillas22 same for me
[2:16:00] Aypex01: NO systems
[2:16:01] TuRDz__: dead on
[2:16:01] xPorkMissilex: I don’t give two shits about lore - lore doesn’t make the game mechanics fun
[2:16:04] CipansR_Ayaya: I just want that feeling back when you cant wait to log on WoW and have fun
[2:16:08] adrian_fell: i dropped your beer
[2:16:10] raye_gaming22: agree wow is all about mythic rading  stroy is cba
[2:16:11] skylaars: quins getting banned 3x from league in a week is amazing
[2:16:12] szble: cataclysm
[2:16:14] dankmeliodas: I quit playing in 9.1 because of the lore
[2:16:15] Scorpionlaw: hold our beer
[2:16:15] jmalmin: We are in a golden age of raids right now. The raids in shadowlands have been really good.
[2:16:16] Shrenko: they'll find a way
[2:16:16] Nutsy: If someone wants a good story they can go and play single player RPG and not a mmo
[2:16:19] cerealkillas22: Like i want the story to be good, but if its shit, its whatever
[2:16:20] PotbellyGoat: making choices matter
[2:16:21] Jarlan23: well first you start with making alextraza evil and burn down stormwind
[2:16:22] LightBladeStream: Well, they kinda messed up in Dragon Soul
[2:16:23] Jarlan23: then you redeem her
[2:16:24] cappei: Danuser's team will find a way
[2:16:25] SnakeDoctor09: SnakeDoctor09 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 38 month streak! 
[2:16:25] freejam013: Is that a challenge?
[2:16:29] laito_: Good class design >> Big damgur
[2:16:30] KonradGM: blizzard : "Is that a challenge towelliee?"
[2:16:33] CipansR_Ayaya: hes dumb dumb
[2:16:33] PidiaP: Make the dragons not able to reproduce anymore Kappa
[2:16:37] N3llee: @Towelliee just tuning in whats the wow leak
[2:16:39] Calphurnious: @weirdo_dude I think a lot of players do but they're just too much in a rush to level and gear they skip it
[2:16:40] c0mmander_starscream: This is the way....
[2:16:40] Vexxsis: @towelliee Hopefully they been looking at Yoshi Ps way of making story content
[2:16:43] Leeon: bought accounts
[2:16:43] Senthius09: feeding
[2:16:46] pavepawns: its quin
[2:16:48] pavepawns: so
[2:16:49] BrotherBeezy: I stopped watching him. It's too over the top now.
[2:16:53] jasonbriggs: prob have to help the aspects regain their power
[2:16:53] Aypex01: @cipansr those days are gone, and it’s not because the game changed, it’s because WE have changed.
[2:16:54] subversv: well he bought the accounts for one lol
[2:16:54] Zivs: bought account and inting yep
[2:16:56] dalvynthedrunk: I hope they dont abandon something like Torghast, make something with more variety and interesting bosses
[2:16:56] Nebulizer87: quinn has fallen off i can't watch him anymore he purposely tries to be toxic now
[2:16:58] PaPaBeaRCA: dragon porn Kappa
[2:17:02] Horseweave: I'm more Lore than Gameplay because I'm not baited by instant gratification, but you're correct Towelliee: People want a good game to play.
[2:17:04] kqr1636431: They are just mass reporting and sniping him
[2:17:05] c0mmander_starscream: Being "Toxic" is a way of life in lol
[2:17:17] EmilandLA: !WOW10
[2:17:18] Moobot: @EmilandLA World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[2:17:23] N3llee: Omg someone tell me info on the new leak
[2:17:31] CipansR_Ayaya: @Aypex01 yeah we have chnged too agree
[2:17:39] IVJamieIV: @Towelliee Yeah I understand where you're coming from but I do feel there's more to it, not just the lore ofc, personally I see it as a pillar of what makes an MMO good. You got (Lore) (Endgame Content) (Class Diversity) and (Systems).
[2:17:40] N3llee: thanks moobot
[2:17:43] szble: and by gameplay you mean dragon girls
[2:17:45] akia03: just give me pretty zones i can murder tons of things in
[2:17:46] cerealkillas22: Story will always play second fiddle to the gameplay
[2:17:47] Calphurnious: VoteYea
[2:17:50] cappei: You can get away with a bad story if the gameplay is good. You can't the other way around
[2:17:51] WhiteKnight74648: Lost ark is proof that the story doesnt have to be great but the gameplay is fun
[2:17:54] Youredoneson666: I just want a real reason to log in. not some "fill this bar and you'll be stronger" shit
[2:17:59] Donswag3: I feel like having a good/properly developed story would take the heat off of the actual state of the game play-wise. but right now they have major issues w both
[2:18:00] TheItalianStallion321: teletubby...DRAGONS
[2:18:00] CipansR_Ayaya: DansGame
[2:18:01] pavepawns: these telebubbies carry nuclear weapons
[2:18:01] KythosMeltdown: wod story sucked and was fun at first
[2:18:01] lithium364: Corgis unleashed
[2:18:02] LesterLinton: sign me up for teletubbies
[2:18:12] WhiteKnight74648: The Sun is the old god.
[2:18:12] Jarlan23: most people don't care about WoW's story because it's always been told exceptionally poorly in game
[2:18:14] dalvynthedrunk: I think a majority care about the story but its a spectrum, a good story wont save bad gameplay but good gameplay will save a bad story
[2:18:14] Lupine_Fury: Po faction all the way
[2:18:15] nocontextlive: nocontextlive subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 76 months! 
[2:18:16] Aidler: Aidler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months, currently on a 55 month streak! 
[2:18:17] Zelrise: its been years since they added pandas.. still hate them so thats not true :P would prefer teletubbies toh
[2:18:19] freejam013: ARR is shit
[2:18:23] mackieeswe: time for multiverse
[2:18:26] krankyoldlady: i left wow cause of toxic m+ crap
[2:18:29] paperbirdd: look at ARR OMEGALUL
[2:18:29] SamDavidsin: bro tinky winkys TV smash is OP
[2:18:43] cerealkillas22: I feel like Lost Ark also doesnt try to hard with its story
[2:18:43] vadder_fister: yea and it shows
[2:18:49] Horseweave: FF14 did it right, and I'm impressed.
[2:18:51] spookyfacegaming: The gameplay is only 1/3 of what is important to me. The lore makes up the other 2/3s. Which is why FF14 demolishes WoW in terms of story. Meanwhile, WoW beats FF14 in the gameplay for me.
[2:18:52] Vexxsis: new pvp looks great in 14
[2:18:53] Jarlan23: like if WoWs story was actually good then more people would care about it
[2:18:56] adrian_fell: i feel like story has more priority for the devs doing FF tho
[2:19:05] DragonofWolves: I enjoyed ARR..
[2:19:07] Jiraiya110: a decent story for wow with fewer plotholes would be nice
[2:19:08] Jarlan23: but they cant keep putting massive story arcs in books and expect people to care about the plot in the game
[2:19:10] freejam013: i don't think they're proud of their story KEKW
[2:19:12] WhiteKnight74648: I look at ARR as a very long prologue
[2:19:15] lithium364: but but romantic weapon
[2:19:23] pavepawns: theres dialogue?
[2:19:26] Jarlan23: if they cant fucking follow the plot because most of it is told in books then i dont blame them for not caring
[2:19:40] WhiteKnight74648: SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY!
[2:19:44] DragonofWolves: or is ARR not liked because it's too damn long?
[2:19:48] Thunderbrew: I'm having a hard time getting to rares cuz I can't fly
[2:19:58] Vexxsis: 6.1 in 11 days for ff14 Kreygasm
[2:19:58] Moobot: Did you know this drop was designed in Photoshop? Students get the whole Adobe Creative suitefor just $19.99/month http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html
[2:20:14] Gotxiko: april 12th yea
[2:20:21] Aquadriel: final who? KappaCool
[2:20:21] Orirholim: @dragonofwolves probably too long but it's pretty much the tutorial of FFXIV, more to level through etc.
[2:20:22] DragonofWolves: April 12th I think
[2:20:23] foxies_havocing: I am fan of more Witcher like story telling than FF
[2:20:24] Thunderbrew: Final Fantasy 14 is a great game and the Dev's really care about the players.
[2:20:25] Jarlan23: new alliance raid
[2:20:27] aurixol: 24 man raid coming
[2:20:28] Vexxsis: @towelliee so much juicy stuff...new PVP and yes raid
[2:20:29] WhiteKnight74648: 24 MAN RAID YEAH
[2:20:30] Gotxiko: questlines, msq, alliance raid...
[2:20:30] akia03: started skipping everything storywise in ff14 after 20 mins playing
[2:20:32] sharkey3322: FF 14 I would believe has more cut scene time then gameplay hours to cap lol
[2:20:32] Jokervenom1978: I tried playing FF14 and it was SOOOO boring.
[2:20:33] mett7: there is trailer
[2:20:34] WhiteKnight74648: caps sorry
[2:20:36] Papatiku: new raid about the 12 Gods too! (24 man) @Towelliee
[2:20:38] dalvynthedrunk: New ultimate I think
[2:20:42] Amarlian: @Thunderbrew Just need a taxi now I think
[2:20:47] Vexxsis: @towelliee yes
[2:20:49] Horseweave: Also the New Ultimate too
[2:20:57] Ertra: !wow10
[2:20:57] Moobot: @Ertra World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583
[2:21:01] Orirholim: @akia03 if you watch the voice stuff, you'll know the story for the most part
[2:21:07] Vexxsis: new pvp looks so fun
[2:21:19] Anacydae: @Horseweave that aint on launch though
[2:21:27] dalvynthedrunk: Idk I gave up on getting into FFXIV, I root for it though, I am a Gw2 andy until 10.0
[2:21:27] WhiteKnight74648: From what Zepla said, the new ultimate is going to take 4-6 months for hardcore players to complete it per the devs
[2:21:28] pavepawns: theres pvp too!?!??
[2:21:30] Vexxsis: shit I will ty
[2:21:33] IVJamieIV: I love WoW, played it since I was 14, am 32 now, but the past two expansions the game has fallen short on two of those pillars, lore and systems. One thing I am very hopeful for next expansion is that it'll be dragon themed. Which it appears is pretty much confirmed.
[2:21:33] Aquadriel: or final fantasy and fun
[2:21:40] Anacydae: ultimate is 6.18 so a bit later
[2:21:42] Thunderbrew: They are making changes to PvP in FF14.
[2:21:45] dalvynthedrunk: @WhiteKnight74648 give it a week and it will get a world first
[2:21:49] PToastman: doubt
[2:22:07] DragonofWolves: I mean pvp exists in ff14 just well I don't know a lot of people that do it
[2:22:09] Vexxsis: @thunderbrew  yeah it's all different
[2:22:10] WhiteKnight74648: @dalvynthedrunk maybe we will see.
[2:22:12] Jairoy: 4 days for world first
[2:22:14] dankmeliodas: It launches I think 2 weeks after the patch
[2:22:29] aurixol: yoshi said 4-6 months
[2:22:29] Anacydae: oh also new housing area gets launched in 6.1 too
[2:22:36] mett7: for averange player
[2:22:42] ditaern: 4-6 months for the average player
[2:22:44] dankmeliodas: For casuals
[2:22:45] Vexxsis: @dragonofwolves yeah the whole zerg pvp was just trash and feast was also
[2:22:45] Nebulizer87: 4-6 for an average group
[2:22:51] aurixol: he prob meant average player
[2:23:02] ANDYisMAD: @Towelliee Would you be against blizzard taking out combat addons off of WoW?
[2:23:03] im_capy: new housing isnt for the new player so much as to slow down bots so to speak
[2:23:05] Thunderbrew: FF14 cares about the Casual players.
[2:23:16] luxsis_: thats for a hard core not world first players
[2:23:21] Jarlan23: like weakauras and stuff
[2:23:24] Anacydae: @Mr_Capy_ you mean the system?
[2:23:26] DragonofWolves: @vexxsis like I know people pvp in ff14 but I think it's not as popular as pve
[2:23:27] luxsis_: for casual they said 6-8 months
[2:23:29] mett7: hard core groups will do it in few days
[2:23:36] Aquadriel: cam from asmongold
[2:23:36] mavericks312: add-ons aren't going anywhere stop it
[2:23:36] mateolaa: probably classic players
[2:23:42] Youredoneson666: should 100% remove combat addons
[2:23:46] Thunderbrew: Blizzard would have to do work if they didn't have addons
[2:23:50] pavepawns: i love addons
[2:23:51] Youredoneson666: Makes the community actually talk to each other again
[2:23:52] cappei: Just people regurgitating Asmongold's shitty opinions
[2:23:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: Needing addons is annoying, but yeah I can't see them being disabled
[2:23:52] sinlesssinner: its mostly weak auras, Max talked about it the other day... not sure why he doesnt like em but yea
[2:23:53] paperbirdd: they've built raid fights and m+ around combat addons why would they ban it now?
[2:23:55] EscapePlan01: seems like anytime anyone says "itll be MONTHS to complete" it takes like a week
[2:23:56] danz_ow: Isnt most encounters designed around them and their limits
[2:23:59] Jarlan23: not all just overwelming ones like weakauras
[2:24:04] Orirholim: they'd have to build in the addons into the game
[2:24:05] Docta_G: they would need to rework the whole game yeah
[2:24:05] Calphurnious: Ulduar was perfect, no addons needed
[2:24:07] subversv: addons and wow are intertwined now
[2:24:07] KythosMeltdown: remove weakauras is really what people mean when they say remove addons
[2:24:10] jasperboy: Remove WA's, im all in for that
[2:24:11] mett7: yeah its to late
[2:24:22] lithium364: what if addons are getting more and more ingame ads and payments? blizzard would have to intervene at some point
[2:24:23] Zelrise: weakauras and dbm needs to go
[2:24:27] Porcos_Voadores: Maybe we can have new specs for some classes and not a real new class ?!
[2:24:28] im_capy: @Anacydae ya, still can be gamed by creating a ton of new FCs
[2:24:30] bekindtoeachothr: I think people would enjoy the game more personally unless they can design it so theres not clearly a best everytime
[2:24:30] mavericks312: WA are here to stay
[2:24:32] sinlesssinner: @jasperboy why? cause Liquid lost wf? :)
[2:24:34] Vexxsis: @dragonofwolves no were near it, Yoshi also said awhile back pvp is a big deal with 14 but I think the whole story arc was just taking alot of resources, since it's done atm it's gotten a huge overhaul
[2:24:36] krankyoldlady: no addons works for ff14
[2:24:45] EscapePlan01: content needs to be designed to not require them to be honest

[2:24:59] Anacydae: @Mr_Capy_ I'm just wondering who said the new housing is for new ppl?xD
[2:25:01] Ribbheden: @krankyoldlady FF14 have plenty of addons
[2:25:05] WhiteKnight74648: Maybe this might help "For Players who arnt aiming for world first but diving straight to the challenge the content as it releases, be prepared to spend 4-5 months"
[2:25:10] dankmeliodas: Max said he thinks the raid mechanic weak auras should get removed

[2:25:15] cerealkillas22: I can raid in WoW with no DBM no boss weakauras, its not hard

[2:26:18] pavepawns: the only issue i have with addons/weakauras is when they become too needed for fights (like mythic archimonde) else i dont mind addons at all

[2:30:53] im_capy: @Anacydae like I said, the community makes claims its new player friendly...how is that housiing even veteran friendly
[2:30:59] Aeonaxxx: but not the vendor
[2:31:04] PadidinJones: Pull the real ripcord!
[2:31:05] ijuki: The vendor is not account bound, but the item is that you want
[2:31:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: None of that stuf is account-wide, but the boost you buy from the vendor is account-bound to send to alts
[2:31:15] pavepawns: if u have fully finished the long timer on 1 char u can research it again on any other char for same cost but only 5 secs
[2:31:27] Ziddrax: Kappa
[2:31:27] Jarlan23: I'd fucking nut if they made most things account wide.
[2:31:29] Youredoneson666: god i fuckin wish
[2:31:32] Anacydae: @Mr_Capy_ How does housing not make it new player friendly though? Like we all agree the housing system is bad
[2:31:41] LesterLinton: i'd like honor to be account wide
[2:31:42] ijuki: You have the quest on the map
[2:31:42] Bloodmyth13: you have it on that guy, quest is there
[2:31:43] BrotherBeezy: The yellow questline right above you on the map
[2:31:54] SpyCrabbo: the quest is on your map @Towelliee
[2:31:57] akia03: its the quest above this cave
[2:31:58] Aidler: from the jiro vendor you also get the item to get 50 % more cyphers
[2:32:03] spookyfacegaming: I can't think of a single legitimate reason to not have reps be account bound. If they wanted alt friendlieness, that is a way to do it.
[2:32:04] Youredoneson666: They never would tho. cause it'll cost them money in the long run.
[2:32:06] thomaspxo: broken circle quest
[2:32:06] BrotherBeezy: yep
[2:32:06] jmalmin: I just want player housing :)

[2:35:57] Ldysansa: So true it take to long to get the alts caught up
[2:35:57] KythosMeltdown: yeah i dont think its that bad, but EQ has that "problem" with HEIRLOOM items (account bound items)
[2:35:58] Zelrise: just get a vendor that gives you the same ilvl as your main? so gear is also accountwide?
[2:35:58] rohdey: if only i could my ~600 sandworn relics on my main to gear my ults
[2:36:03] Senthius09: the gear grind isnt the problem with alts, its all the ancillary bullshit that you have to grind in addition to gear, gear is easy
[2:36:14] Orirholim: would get people to player other classes too, healer/tank/etc i stick to one because it's not account bound
[2:36:19] Jarlan23: If playing my alts didn't feel like a chore I'd play about 200% more
[2:36:20] Orirholim: i'd play others if it were account wide

[2:36:34] thecynicalshuffler: i agree..  it a big plus for ffxiv being able to play all your jobs without having to unlock everything multiple times.. i would low to see some of that here
[2:36:34] Jarlan23: because i love playing alts but i dont want to grind systems on them
[2:36:37] akia03: wouldnt you need to have a bunch of alts than to funnel mats/rep power system stuff to your main
[2:36:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: Especially with the PvP that really want to switch classes often, making it easier for alts gives them more reasons to play
[2:36:53] rohdey: or worse, your ult gets the gear you want your main to get
[2:36:56] zeitgeiz: Gear grind on alts is fine, campaign, renown, leggos, rep, and rating is a lot to grind just so you can get gear
[2:36:58] rohdey: alt*
[2:37:02] Sarocus: And expand the achievement system (steal the tome from Warhammer)
[2:37:08] Ezekyler: also farm algain all the renown for your covenant

[2:40:48] Buckwink: Ion just needs to do raids
[2:40:56] jmalmin: No matter what blizzard do, they get complaints :) Also most people who complain do not play the game at all. so they do not know how the game is.

[2:42:44] cappei: Bet you he won't be the one announcing Dragonflight
[2:42:53] itscityboy: Is it worth coming back yet?
[2:42:53] biirrd: Ion "vision" of the game is not in line with the player base anymore. Change is needed
[2:42:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Morgan seems great to me, I just don't like some of the things he says
[2:42:57] Lesliech0w: How many trash Expacs does Ion need to helm though?

[2:44:13] cappei: @dalvynthedrunk Ion took over way late in Legion development. And since then with Ion we've gotten BFA and Shadowlands. So I mean, I think I know what my opinion is
[2:44:13] IVJamieIV: Haha
[2:44:17] lithium364: because it would be childish
[2:44:18] EmpathyLiveChat: The creative director used to be the Warchief

[2:44:26] BubblePriest: game designers are so low on the poll, you are talking about a game director
[2:44:28] BfAleTitan: Metzen was definitely called warchief internally before he left lol

[2:54:27] realnzall: @Towelliee The new water in Zereth Mortis is significantly more demanding on my GPU than any other location in ZM. Every time I get in an area with a lot of water, my 1070 fans spin up like mad
[2:54:33] pavepawns: but guys. its magical

[3:10:27] Aervyper: @Towelliee they took pictures of the cosby room they are that stupid
[3:10:40] KradishUK: I don't think Blizzard would ever prank people with Dragon Isles - the actual expansion would have to be so fucking hype that people wouldn't be pissed off about not getting Dragon Isles
[3:10:45] Sylphy_TV: zekeTHINK but what if they are... that dumb, who knows

[3:17:17] Molvonos: @masashiro92 Yes.  No.  Maybe.
[3:17:20] Vexxsis: @KawaXIV yea
[3:17:40] KawaXIV: @Vexxsis in XIV if it's not ultimate, it's not that difficult for me any more /shrug
[3:17:46] Orirholim: @masashiro92 I'd say yes because the power fantasy this season is the best it's been since 9.0
[3:17:55] KawaXIV: doesn't mean i dont like it btw, i love alliance raids cause they're just fun, but yknow
[3:17:55] Vexxsis: @KawaXIV since it is about the 12 and i believe the bosses have narrative during fights

[3:21:08] Ellyasveil: yea but why tho.. lol
[3:21:12] Orirholim: @Dante20404 yup, best patch wow has had in awhile due to power fantasy feel
[3:21:34] Snabido: Zone creativity seems cool
[3:21:42] KinggKebab: 9.2 so far is the most fun i've had so far this entire expansion tbh and what we know about 9.2.5 already seems like blizz are finally getting there shit together, Hopefully it can translate into an entire expansion
[3:22:34] DegenerateHaven: true
[3:22:37] Doomske: how bout dem colts lol @Towelliee
[3:22:39] KradishUK: One of the many issues I have with Blizz is that they come up with some cracking ideas but then put it through 5 passes of 'how do we make this less fun for players' before releasing it
[3:22:46] Dizmal: spot on @Towelliee

[3:23:14] Dante20404: yeah but compair to last patch of BFA it was horrible the rng corruption and then the shuffle corruption vendor later on this is amazing

[3:24:27] c0mmander_starscream: Nah Towelliee's GOT this! Leeeeeerooooooyy!
[3:24:35] maccaruso: Easy key, lol.  I've never completed above an 8
[3:24:36] KawaXIV: @Orirholim yeah i have a full time job and play XIV pretty hardcore so it's really hard to tell what I can do. I can get through single player games (i beat elden ring last week) on the side so I feel like I *could* run another MMO on the side, but i'm not entirely sure, and I think the spare time won't be consistent so my fear is things like falling behind on progression systems or being unavailable for a wow raid schedule making the endeavor pointless
[3:24:42] Orirholim: @Horseweave google mdi routes
[3:24:48] KradishUK: I think we need AVR to show casters where they are and aren't allowed to stand
[3:24:53] Orirholim: there are addons too
[3:25:15] Orirholim: @KawaXIV naw don't do two mmos at once, you'll burn yourself out 100%
[3:25:26] Dante20404: @Towelliee compair to BFA witth the RNG azerite and the corruption gamble then later on with the shuffle corruption vendor this patch is a 10 lol

[3:31:53] Kisswani: Any Dragonflghters ? danSus
[3:32:06] Sielu11628: @desjester yes
[3:32:23] Gotxiko: sadly yes, 1 year. the patch cadence is demoralizing
[3:32:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Like Wrath in October would be fine with me, November is more likely tho
[3:32:41] Orirholim: @desjester most likely, probably Q1 2023 at the very least for the next expansion
[3:32:47] TooZooted_: Bro
[3:32:53] ijuki: @Kisswani Any dragonflighting?* Kappa
[3:33:05] Kisswani: @Sielu11628 because of the certificate dates ?

[3:33:51] KinggKebab: Wait, is it on a weekly rotation? Or are all raids gonna be available at once every week?
[3:33:54] LunaKura: I personally didn't have any problems with BFA until Corruption.
[3:33:58] TrixStar36: @Towelliee is that going to effect the time to get AOTC for jailer?
[3:33:58] HolyThird: La concurrenc e est plus ardu maintenant Lost Ark est là et FF va se blindé de contenu au prochain patch...

[3:34:16] Jarlan23: i fucking hated corruption there wasnt anything i liked it about it
[3:34:24] HigameR4771: <3
[3:34:25] Rudric_Ice: give us a new recolored armor at least
[3:34:34] Kisswani: Besides , 9.2.5 might cut on the Alpha / Beta cycle of the new expansion , due to testing cross faction and scaling
[3:34:43] Aquadriel: glubbietv you can unsub too.
[3:35:15] Squats3: @Towelliee think they will do a boost for WOTLK classic when it comes out?
[3:35:20] cakepickle: So for the next year the only incentive to stay subbed is for blizz to throw rewards at content players arent excited about to play with the standard rewards?
[3:35:21] Kisswani: @Aquadriel LUL was a about to write that . people make seem like mandatory taxes or something KEKW

[4:16:56] daniel85mg: wow VR
[4:17:03] KawaXIV: @mavericks312 all depends on how good the controller implementation is

[4:17:12] Skylin3r: also, the whole addon scene
[4:17:12] damperstv: @KawaXIV its the simple fact that wow is not build for console.
[4:17:12] flazkan: How is wow nowdays? Is it worth getting a new subscription and give it a try?
[4:17:15] Dudutoolbox: @MayroVision yeah there is an addon

[4:19:14] MinivannGaming: You could use Keyboard and Mouse with a XB and be fine i think

[4:19:20] Kisswani: @KawaXIV I think's it's more the addons tbh , not really the abilities or movememnt or anything
[4:19:33] TheItalianStallion321: 100% wow console players would not be able to keep up UNLESS they are using mouse/keyboard, which you should probably just play on PC then
[4:19:38] TheItalianStallion321: the FPS would be shit
[4:19:41] KawaXIV: @Kisswani actually a reasonable argument
[4:19:47] Dudutoolbox: @BaldBroGaming Reminds me of ESO, console players dont use them and do endgame fine while pc players are dependent on them

[4:21:42] Shrenko: I would use console to farm stuff
[4:21:44] ahies28: nope
[4:21:45] marcusmiller: not at all
[4:21:46] MayroVision: I would…
[4:21:49] Dkgungo: i would use it for farming on my couch lol
[4:21:50] MILESkg21: if u travel alot then u would
[4:21:53] Dudutoolbox: people who dont have a pc
[4:21:53] CochaCR: to level up alts I would while questing
[4:21:53] MayroVision: I don’t have a gaming Pc yet
[4:21:54] fowlentv: @Skylin3r Eso is
[4:21:56] Funderik: i'd semi use if you chilled farming
[4:21:57] Zerksyera: console probably easy mode
[4:21:58] KawaXIV: addons is pretty much the only argument that seems reasonable. Again we have top end parsers in XIV playing on console, or playing controller on PC - provided the support is good enough, it's not the input device standing in the way.
[4:22:06] Sylphy_TV: if it was on switch igaLeave il see myself out
[4:22:09] Shrenko: @MayroVision bless you!
[4:22:10] Kisswani: @MilesKG21 I mean ... Laptop ?
[4:22:13] StraightErro: The race to console first
[4:22:19] tobiasbuntu: console is just like pc, but worse, lets play on console!
[4:22:22] Skylin3r: well ESO is easy cause of the skill slot limits
[4:22:23] mavericks312: WoW runs on a toaster
[4:22:23] grimpenguinn: @MayroVision  thats what gaming laptops are for
[4:22:24] Delectceled: ffxiv is literally built to be played on console lmfao, not a reason wow would work on it
[4:22:26] PrimalBF: LUL
[4:22:27] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: no you can't KEKW
[4:22:28] MILESkg21: @Kisswani forgot about laptop plebs 4Head
[4:22:37] TheItalianStallion321: play or RAID on your grandma's 50 year old calculator lol
[4:22:40] Shrenko: laptop WutFace
[4:22:40] Mockle: what you mean pc...i played wow back in 2005 on a busted laptop
[4:22:44] mavericks312: WoW is not made for console
[4:22:47] SamDavidsin: console players... of course the pc players wont switch to console,
[4:22:50] Dkgungo: putting it on game pass would be bigger
[4:22:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Look at the sales of PS5's....a lot of people have them
[4:22:52] TigasLIVE: WF On console PogChamp
[4:22:53] DegenerateHaven: fix the server lag
[4:22:54] Dudutoolbox: @Delectceled bdo was not build for console and it has crazy inputs and yet its on console
[4:22:58] MayroVision: My work laptop is my only PC and with all my files on it… I just couldn’t handle it.
[4:23:00] wetfarts99: I won’t but you would gain a whole new crowd there are still people out there towellie who haven’t discovered pc gaming
[4:23:02] Shrenko: no one is really asking for wow on console either
[4:23:03] daniel85mg: i played on an old amd shit video card, can confirm potato pcs work
[4:23:20] Kisswani: @MilesKG21 *cries in the corner * I travel a lot, gaming laptops have been great for me in the past 10 or so years .
[4:23:25] MayroVision: I want to build a gaming PC, no idea where to start. Im accepting any help/direction.
[4:23:27] gerrie28: lol
[4:23:28] Funderik: not about being cute, it's about having more people play, doesn't matter if current players don't go on xbox but new people will see it.
[4:23:30] fowlentv: New World would work good on consoles
[4:23:36] Sollice: Stop spamming the same shit
[4:23:51] brilargaming: brilar1967 converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[4:23:53] ahies28: ^^
[4:23:59] MILESkg21: Sniped EZ Clap
[4:24:02] Kickstand_: I would think it would just trash the game for the current player base. imagine how easy they would have to make every boss and mechanic
[4:24:04] Skylin3r: towKawaii
[4:24:09] wetfarts99: Look how many people play ffarr on console
[4:24:25] MILESkg21: FF14 was made for Consoles
[4:24:33] KawaXIV: amount of buttons/abilities to hit are not the problem with putting an mmo on a console
[4:24:38] Orirholim: @Kickstand_ they wouldn't, there's youtube videos of people doing high key mythics + raids with a controller on wow, dunno
[4:24:38] mavericks312: but those players would not be invited into end game content
[4:24:39] Syborc: @Kickstand_ idk, just give the "console-mode"
[4:24:39] JustinNotFoundx: lol
[4:24:40] Dudutoolbox: bdo was not made for console
[4:24:44] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: @MilesKG21 slootI slootCopium
[4:24:53] Syborc: for raids/dungeons @Kickstand_
[4:24:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Our new overlord Phil Spencer understands lol
[4:25:08] KawaXIV: again, there's classes in 14 with 34 abilities (job and role actions) plus sprint, limit break, food, and pots and there's enough controller binds with their cross hotbar system to cover all of that
[4:25:11] Morpheusx25: @weirdo_dude overlord and savior!
[4:25:13] Dalsonson: If it’s a shared account, I’d DEF fuck with Xbox
[4:25:14] CMack_72: Current Wow:  Your grandpa's game
[4:25:16] Syborc: @Orirholim but thats not the norm, the casual player would not be able to do that

[4:25:44] Mockle: I wanna play wow with my racing wheel...get on it Blizz!
[4:25:47] daniel85mg: @MayroVision gaming PC? or just wow? i play with min rquirements and works fine.
[4:25:48] KawaXIV: controller is not the limit, it's quality of implementation (which i have my doubts about blizzard doing that well) and addons
[4:25:48] Dudutoolbox: if they want to make it work on console they can just rework the UI functionality which all mmos do when porting to console
[4:25:49] MayroVision: Are gaming Laptops just as good as gaming PC towers?
[4:25:50] magemaster225: would you put WoW on phones though
[4:26:04] MattJ063: MattJ063 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[4:26:05] Orirholim: @Syborc if wow had the same controller setup as ffxiv, don't see how it wouldn't work, i think the biggest obstacle is addons but they can just copy ff14 boss/mechanic telegraphs
[4:26:10] MILESkg21: yeah Racing Wheel or VR Kappa
[4:26:20] Kickstand_: wow mobile. no graphics just buttons and status bars
[4:26:32] Molvonos: @MilesKG21 Go hard or go home: play on an electronic keyboard.
[4:26:36] Delectceled: @KawaXIV it's just addons fam that's the only reason, I don't think anyone reasonable is arguing that there isn't enough buttons
[4:26:37] Orirholim: dbm would probably have to be baked into wow for console to work as well and not an addon
[4:26:38] KawaXIV: @Orirholim i dont think they should change game design elements just for console unless people want a different style of telegraphing to begin with
[4:26:41] annokev: Ask the priest if they have forgotten their key bind for pain sup
[4:26:45] mavericks312: @Orirholim but if groups can see your not ising addons in end game content there not gonna invite you because addons arent going anywhere
[4:26:54] MayroVision: @minimalcode both. My only PC is my work laptop currently. I couldn’t imagine running Wow considering just 3 excel files open destroys my laptop lol
[4:27:05] KawaXIV: @KawaXIV it kinda seemed like people were but perhaps you're right
[4:27:16] Orirholim: @mavericks312 i don't use addons and have done endgame stuff, unless you mean mythic dungeons/pvp stuff sure
[4:27:22] TroyStory__: Killed Prob, but need to click totem
[4:27:29] TroyStory__: FR
[4:27:36] vdoc: front right
[4:27:41] extrnl2: @MayroVision excel actually hammers your ram if they're big files and you dont have a ton of ram
[4:27:44] Dudutoolbox: addons are not an issue, people do ESO hardcore endgame content just fine on console
[4:27:45] BrotherBeezy: If only there were 6 markers showing where to go
[4:27:46] jiffynuts: Up up down down left right left right?
[4:27:48] TroyStory__: Its based off of where you are now
[4:28:00] Orirholim: i doubt wow comes to console just because of the difficulty of bringing it to console anyways, would be an interesting porting project with how old wow is
[4:28:01] rolando415: damn a whole year?
[4:28:01] MarauderT5: it rotate where you are facing
[4:28:08] magemaster225: you rotate 90 degress every time
[4:28:10] mavericks312: @Orirholim no one is inviting anyone to a mythic raid without atleast dbm/bigwigs
[4:28:26] daniel85mg: @MayroVision kinda same what i did honestly, but my focus is just wow. i got a nice ssd and decent cpu. Than checked min video requ for shadowlands, and started looking at afordable gps form that point and up
[4:28:38] MayroVision: @extrnl2 hmmm had no idea…
[4:28:55] TroyStory__: shhhh

[4:29:21] KawaXIV: @Orirholim I have no idea why I'm even arguing in favor of it, cause its not like the japanese market situation with XIV where if they didnt sell it on console they'd make very few sales in that region at all, since pc gaming is quite unpopular still, but I guess I just believe it's possible and that's enough for me to advocate it i guess
[4:29:35] tenassity69: frost mage doing 9.0 m+ numbers. love to see it

[5:17:56] Hakazo: @KawaXIV Not sure on NA since I play EU, currently im in a mythic raiding guild in EU alliance so, its not just horde - however try asking around for populated horde guilds in NA
[5:17:58] Buckwink: *boss

[5:18:51] Buckwink: @Fat_Tony3 better than getting a rushed piece of shit one
[5:19:02] J1nnTV: wow needs a graphics update starting to look like an app game
[5:19:18] Radtvlol: maybe wotlk comes sooner to hold until a 2023 10.0
[5:19:54] Buckwink: towel plays on lower settings too
[5:19:56] KawaXIV: he said "app game" though, not mobile
[5:19:58] MILESkg21: needs Unreal 5 Kappa
[5:20:01] KawaXIV: which is a self defeating argument
[5:20:05] ArcaneSyntax: I actually wow is one of the better looking MMOs lol
[5:20:08] KawaXIV: app is just short for application and wow is an application

[5:20:14] indb1: yeah more impressive on mobile games, not really a knock on wow tbh
[5:20:17] SensationalBanana: Idiots unable to tell the difference between art style and graphics.
[5:20:17] KawaXIV: nah im arguing that "app" is not a mobile term
[5:20:17] ijuki: Unreal 6 is what WoW needs Kappa
[5:20:19] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: mobile games look pretty good considering these days
[5:20:28] ArcaneSyntax: And it basically can run on everything, which is not something you can say for most MMOs.
[5:20:35] J1nnTV: unreal engine on wow would be awesome
[5:20:45] MILESkg21: considering most mobile games arent mmo's
[5:20:59] ijuki: @Fat_Tony3 But raids with affixes Kappa
[5:21:01] chrslp: Its probably another 4-6 months at least of TBC classic before Wrath too
[5:21:07] KawaXIV: @J1nnTV unreal engine is prone to input latency problems that I'm pretty sure wow players would universally hate
[5:21:09] Hakazo: Hot topic: Unreal Engine would be garbo and not as smooth, however a engine update might be required in the near future
[5:21:12] chrslp: ZA just came out and we still have Sunwell coming
[5:21:13] KawaXIV: also stutter
[5:21:21] itscityboy: true
[5:21:24] SensationalBanana: Amen
[5:21:33] itscityboy: i have high hopes for the new expac
[5:21:34] indb1: you think lost ark looks better or wow?
[5:21:35] toobaked1987: Haters gonna hate!
[5:21:35] Sollice: I think people forget what the art style of wow is
[5:21:41] Sielu11628: How can anyone say SL looks bad?
[5:21:42] Hakazo: @itscityboy same
[5:21:46] Sollice: and WoW will NEVER be on Unreal
[5:21:54] Lesliech0w: one video display of Wow in unreal engine out there and everyone creams their jeans about it lol

[5:22:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Maybe they will offer a pirate dragon mount with the new expansion, in like an expensive pack
[5:22:10] Ghhost117: You think Blizz eventually does a WoW 2 or anything of the likes?
[5:22:11] theDirtyon3: i would never want wow on unreal
[5:22:13] KawaXIV: I don't really like the art style, but it looks good at being that kind of art style for the most part
[5:22:21] KawaXIV: art direction and fidelity/quality are two different things
[5:22:28] MILESkg21: D:
[5:22:40] ijuki: @Fat_Tony3 Well, there are other games for you to play while you wait
[5:22:42] ArcaneSyntax: wow 2 happened in 2010 bro.

[5:23:32] Horseweave: They be that good performance wise?
[5:24:02] ijuki: @Fat_Tony3 Play another class/spec, change to the faction... just to spice it all up
[5:24:40] Metket: no @Towelliee they are not 278 and it reduces my ilvl so they are garbage Kappa Kappa Kappa
[5:24:41] KawaXIV: does that mean you can't really go back into SoD to get them because if you aren't experienced in there people wouldn't take you in?
[5:24:48] KawaXIV: or are there groups that go back in and get shit
[5:25:30] ijuki: @Fat_Tony3 Then I guess you have to wait then... like the rest of us... but I am going to try new things in WoW myself
[5:25:47] Gyhlen: Oh ye i love that about my DK
[5:25:54] KawaXIV: I can't tell what the WoW community is like in-game because of the way they talk about the game out-of-game: you'd think everyone is a hardcore raider and extremely exclusionary/gatekeepy but that can't be the case right?
[5:26:11] KawaXIV: @Fat_Tony3 why just 50%?

[5:27:23] ijuki: @Fat_Tony3 MMO's require time ... if you get bored "fast" then the genre might not be for you
[5:27:28] zgag: Is the new xpac confirmed to be Dragonflight? Or is it still more of a rumor
[5:27:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: There are the hardcore meta-slave people, and total casuals, and everything inbetween

[5:28:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oooooh he can trade it
[5:28:58] KawaXIV: @weirdo_dude i guess the question is more like is there a clear way into hardcore via assistance from the hardcore community or do you kinda have to jump at the start of an expac and keep up to get in or get excluded for being behind? can't tell
[5:29:23] ijuki: 226 chest? monkaS
[5:29:23] KawaXIV: i've asked stuff like this here and other chats but not a lot of clear info
[5:29:29] psycho_scythe: Dragon flight xpac? Is there a VOD or something I can rewatch? @towelliee
[5:29:39] sinlesssinner: buy the profession 262 gear?

[5:29:47] ijuki: Can't you like get the crafted one?
[5:29:53] ijuki: Or is that your cloak?
[5:29:58] CritcobainTV: I tried that dungeon without Shuriken Tornado. That was not the move, my dps was shit
[5:30:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: @KawaXIV Mostly it's a question of getting into a good guild, and that does take some work to prove yourself for the better ones
[5:30:19] CritcobainTV: boss dmg was good tho
[5:30:32] KawaXIV: @Towelliee is there a clear path into mythic guilds at any time other than the start of an expansion?

[5:31:08] KawaXIV: @weirdo_dude are there enough catch up mechanics that proving onesself is possible at times outside of expansion launch periods though?
[5:31:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: The better guilds want to see your achievements and you have to apply to them, so maybe you have to start in a medium-ish guild
[5:31:21] KawaXIV: or do you sit perpetually behind until the next equalizing moment
[5:31:31] zgag: Seems pretty legit from what I saw
[5:31:33] CritcobainTV: They're still only gonna lose like 10% dps total or something
[5:31:36] ijuki: @KawaXIV If you make the guild ... you can get straight in it POGGERS
[5:31:46] CritcobainTV: Yooo lemme get in on that, i got a 21 theater too if u want

[5:34:28] Xelim27: i wouldnt want it to be this year even... @Towelliee
[5:34:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: From the money standpoint, they need to get back to released the expansions in November....so if it does have to be late it's better Q1
[5:34:33] MILESkg21: Q1 23 earliest
[5:34:45] nezz231: feb 31 for sure Kappa

[5:36:51] LeideGaming: @Towelliee you're granted free PS5 upgrade of the Remake
[5:36:52] 0liver_91: @Gurtogg we just need to get rid off stupid secondary systems really and more RPG elements like better integration of professions once again.
[5:36:52] Crumikz: It dosent do that on mine..
