[0:16:42] SpacemanJohn: just play a comp with both Kappa
[0:16:56] hataroxz: cdew got farm by it as well yesterday
[0:17:04] ezmoney3434: outlaw / bdk ez gg lol
[0:17:05] worstboomkinna: mes climbed to #1 on the ladder playing it KEKW
[0:17:15] nightmxz: I only saw 1 game and they won pretty handily
[0:17:23] taylorperiod: ran into my first blood dk/dh team in 3s last night at 2k
[0:17:24] nightmxz: Cdew's team that is*
[0:17:33] taylorperiod: barely scraped by playing outlaw ele lmao
[0:17:54] DevobotOCE: have you played holy lately Ven, it's so fun
[0:18:09] DevobotOCE: very fun imo
[0:18:22] Somanie: did they recently update holy??
[0:18:23] Sosatko: I was quein some Splay last night itowns lol
[0:18:31] DevobotOCE: @Somanie yea it got some nice dmg buffs and some small healing buffs
[0:18:41] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[0:19:04] nikthevoker: pve reasons
[0:19:07] trikkSP: no one like to play against unholy LUL
[0:19:13] MagickWarlock: fucking nerf dh's already what a dumb class
[0:19:15] Sosatko: Rogues are warctafts baby
[0:19:18] Somanie: @DevobotOCE ooouuu I'll be back in then lol
[0:19:20] Sosatko: Idk how a rogue can even lose lol
[0:19:29] DevobotOCE: the 30% to chastise and 30% to smite is feeling good for that extra pressure so when you get time to do some damage it actually feels nice
[0:19:30] demololtv: nerf dev
[0:19:30] dailyshuffle: hunter also no nerfs, surv also got a 4% dmg buff
[0:19:31] Cdenzy: They really always do nerf dks LULW
[0:19:33] Shovel99: because they hate dks with a passion
[0:19:53] nightmxz: I feel like DKs problem is always it's damage and they don't have enough other strengths so they always just nerf or buff damage to balance it :(
[0:20:03] DevobotOCE: i queued up yesterday on Holy in all greens into a 1950 lobby and won 5 rounds haha, I was pumping
[0:20:07] trikkSP: i literally think grip is the most toxic ability in the game, but might be biased
[0:20:08] Somanie: @DevobotOCE aww I'm PvE, and none of the PvE talents and stuff changed Sadge that's what I'm waiting for
[0:20:15] Somanie: I miss Prayer of Healing and Circle of Healing in m+
[0:20:23] worstboomkinna: Nerfing DKs on top of armor nerf when DK gets dumpstered by physical damage is wild
[0:20:31] DevobotOCE: for sure
[0:20:33] sixthycent: HOLY Is fun
[0:20:37] DevobotOCE: 30% buff to Smite and Chastise
[0:20:43] Sosatko: I liked Holy when i played it last szn
[0:20:43] Outer_Limitz: stun
[0:20:48] DevobotOCE: it actually feels good when you can do damage now
[0:20:48] Sosatko: it has alot of outplay potential
[0:21:05] kusoneko: whenever i watch zenlyn it looks stressful as hell, but he's playing against all r1's so maybe its funner at lower rating
[0:21:08] tarth_100: chastise is fun
[0:21:10] sixthycent: its stressful
[0:21:11] DevobotOCE: and I always loved setting up your own chastise plays, the tier set is also insane
[0:21:13] sixthycent: but fun
[0:21:15] DevobotOCE: read the tier set for it
[0:21:15] Nachofez: nothing better than waking up in a saturday and having ven's stream up
[0:21:15] tarth_100: is what it comes down to
[0:21:24] burekodsira12: one cc chain and your team mates die
[0:21:26] sixthycent: if you hold a serenity charge you proc free ones alot off renew
[0:21:29] soddi: heal is stressful right now, not holy in particular -.-
[0:21:37] sixthycent: from tier set
[0:21:52] DevobotOCE: yea, sanctify applies 6 seconds renew and serenity applies 18 seconds renew, so you don't really need to worry about applying it ALL the time now
[0:21:55] sixthycent: pom on cd
[0:21:59] DevobotOCE: and renew procs free half cost holy word uses
[0:22:21] Renethadox: Venruki during retail cata player you were op player asf, are you gonna play cata classic?

[0:22:49] DevobotOCE: chastise is amazing
[0:23:01] mayonaes: I think i am about to drop dps and become a healer main
[0:23:08] mayonaes: just switch it up
[0:23:12] mayonaes: fuck it
[0:23:15] DevobotOCE: phase shift, seraphic crescendo and spirit
[0:23:21] Renethadox: Venruki during retail cata you were op player asf, are you gonna play cata classic?
[0:23:24] Zeniticon: phase shift
[0:23:27] worstboomkinna: @mayonaes you will never blame a healer ever again if you do it
[0:23:43] sixthycent: spirit and divine hymn
[0:23:50] DevobotOCE: yep
[0:23:53] DevobotOCE: u can crit holy fires for almost 100k
[0:23:54] sixthycent: yea
[0:23:58] kusoneko: @worstboomkinna until you get good, then you start blaming shit heals again
[0:23:58] sixthycent: trick is cast holy fire
[0:24:02] sixthycent: then press blaze
[0:24:11] sixthycent: it resets the cd so u get 4 holy fire back to back
[0:24:15] DevobotOCE: your other 2 pvp talents will be seraphic crescendo and phase shift
[0:24:32] worstboomkinna: @worstboomkinna right, you think its simple then realize the chaos and panic
[0:24:32] DevobotOCE: yep
[0:24:38] DevobotOCE: and it goes to a 1 min cd if they don't "die" during it
[0:24:41] sixthycent: holy word sanctify doesnt heal much but
[0:24:42] mayonaes: This Kimchi and white rice is hitting right now
[0:24:48] sixthycent: it give you the lil naaru dude
[0:24:55] DevobotOCE: sanctify doesn't do crazy healing but with the tier set it puts 6 seconds of renew on everyone it hits which can help you proc the tier set
[0:25:00] ruzo___: dope song!
[0:25:03] DevobotOCE: it basically saves you 3 gcds
[0:25:09] Renethadox: Yo
[0:25:09] DevobotOCE: yep
[0:25:11] Renethadox: Ho
[0:25:14] Renethadox: Hi
[0:25:14] DevobotOCE: serenity is your big pump
[0:25:18] Somanie: that's your Swiftmend
[0:25:22] DevobotOCE: nah not really
[0:25:24] sixthycent: no
[0:25:25] sixthycent: very rare
[0:25:27] DevobotOCE: if you have time to cast it, it can be mana efficient
[0:25:28] sixthycent: in SS you wont use heal
[0:25:31] DevobotOCE: its like healing surge vs healing wave
[0:25:34] Zeniticon: pom and renew 90%
[0:25:36] sixthycent: symbols is good
[0:25:55] DevobotOCE: Apotheosis is your main healing CD
[0:26:04] DevobotOCE: uhhh it's niche
[0:26:10] Zeniticon: mastery
[0:26:17] nightmxz: Apoth is a talent
[0:26:20] DevobotOCE: ray of hope is more taken in 2s
[0:26:34] DevobotOCE: phase shift is how you fade hoj's etc
[0:26:47] DevobotOCE: divine hymn is big as well
[0:26:51] DevobotOCE: you almost always want to cast it in spirit of the redeemer tho
[0:26:52] sixthycent: CAsty hymn in spirit form
[0:26:54] DevobotOCE: or they'll just kick
[0:26:58] sixthycent: or if someone duels your tm8
[0:26:59] DevobotOCE: so you press spirit of the redeemer and slam divine hymn
[0:27:21] Zeniticon: you one top everything
[0:27:29] DevobotOCE: ye so now when you slam flash heals you basically half serenity's cd
[0:27:30] Renethadox: Venruki during retail cata you were op player asf, are you gonna play cata classic?
[0:27:33] DevobotOCE: 2 flash heals is like another serenity chargegg
[0:27:36] soddi: i always overthing apeothis, as i never wanna press it if I have charges left of stun/heal :<
[0:27:44] Zeniticon: its like playing mage with alter
[0:27:44] Affixiate: alot of big damage and heal spikes for sure with holy
[0:27:45] DevobotOCE: it is, but the fact you serenity's hit like 500k +
[0:27:54] tarth_100: hpriest needs fae guardians back  >.>
[0:27:55] nightmxz: Holy is fine until you fight assa rogue and arms warr and their sharpens delete your entire kit
[0:28:12] sixthycent: your s-f
[0:28:13] sixthycent: keybind
[0:28:16] DevobotOCE: yep
[0:28:25] DevobotOCE: u cant heal urself
[0:28:27] DevobotOCE: yep
[0:28:38] nightmxz: You can't spend mana in that form
[0:28:38] DevobotOCE: hymn is ur first GCD in spirit form
[0:28:42] sixthycent: you hymn
[0:28:44] Nachofez: i also picked up holy priest 2 days ago
[0:28:45] sixthycent: then spam flash heal
[0:28:46] tarth_100: they hymn if they take hymn pvp talent
[0:28:47] Affixiate: hymn puts the healing increase buff up if you take the pvp talent
[0:28:49] Sosatko: Think of serenity like a layon hands
[0:28:52] sixthycent: or cleanse UA while int hat form
[0:28:56] sixthycent: spam flash heals
[0:28:59] DevobotOCE: just press Prayer of Mending on CD, make sure renew is on whoever is taking damage
[0:29:07] Sosatko: sanc is rly good for mastery i thinkI forget tbh
[0:29:08] sixthycent: sanc is just to proc ur healin ai
[0:29:09] DevobotOCE: sanctify is basically just used to put renew on every1 it hits
[0:29:10] DevobotOCE: read the tier set
[0:29:11] Sosatko: im not the best source for hpriest lol
[0:29:11] Somanie: I think of Serenity as more of a Swiftmend
[0:29:14] nightmxz: You can't be interrupted + mana can't be spent in angel form so you hymn and them spam flash heals to reset your serenity CD
[0:29:46] DevobotOCE: i sucked at holy the first couple times i played it, but it's very very straight forward when it clicks
[0:29:49] DevobotOCE: and u can pump so much healing
[0:29:59] Somanie: @nightmxz ahhhh that makes sense
[0:30:19] DevobotOCE: u can spend ur Serenity's a lot more freely now since you get lots of procs with the tier set
[0:31:40] Goats48: nerf rdruids pls
[0:31:44] DevobotOCE: just keep renew on whoever is taking dmg, keep prayer of mending on cooldown
[0:31:47] DevobotOCE: thats ur main rotation
[0:32:03] DevobotOCE: renew is like earth shield
[0:32:05] DevobotOCE: they get more healing from u
[0:32:14] Somanie: practice makes perfect bro, work the magic
[0:32:50] DevobotOCE: you don't really think about divine images, but all u gotta know about it is that when you press prayer of mending with a divine image out, it does big heals
[0:33:22] swolegreekgod: gotta go to gym love u ven have a good stream
[0:33:23] DevobotOCE: just slam serenity for big heals, if u run out of charges and they're still taking huge dam then slam Apoth and pump
[0:33:26] DevobotOCE: its niche, more for 2s
[0:33:54] DevobotOCE: you can power word shield yea, its pretty good when you wan to do more triage
[0:34:00] DevobotOCE: sanctify is just for putting renews on ppl with the tier set
[0:34:05] DevobotOCE: read tier set real quick you will see what i mean
[0:34:09] DevobotOCE: yep
[0:34:22] DevobotOCE: i love holy priest

[0:35:08] DevobotOCE: @MaximumnNeo its feeling very nice hey

[0:35:55] Sosatko: Need 10 wins for the green boy mount next seasons tho will be so cool
[0:35:59] MaximumnNeo: holy is basically POM spam, and strategic flashing to reset serenity
[0:36:16] DevobotOCE: yep GS is big
[0:36:21] DevobotOCE: it goes to 1 min cd if they don't proc it, so they don't die with it on
[0:36:27] Somanie: do you want a holy wa?

[0:36:51] DevobotOCE: mastery is tons of ur healing
[0:37:07] DevobotOCE: just chastise healer on cd
[0:37:18] DevobotOCE: smite also resets chastise cd
[0:37:21] DevobotOCE: flash heal resets serenity
[0:37:25] DevobotOCE: apoth like triples all the cdr
[0:37:42] DevobotOCE: he's already a natural, renews out the gagte
[0:37:43] 1s2real: i have chaste on B key

[0:39:23] gentlecatzz: Hotline miami 2 soundtrack! Awesome!
[0:39:48] DevobotOCE: you're pumping ven!
[0:40:07] massiveshade: back then the niche meta like dispell war or mana burn were pretty meh
[0:40:15] DevobotOCE: symbol of hope also gives u mana back
[0:40:32] Sosatko: Is Hpriest #1 or 2 healing still its mastery? I havent played it ina while
[0:40:36] sniperxer: priests used to have invis run up and fear
[0:40:49] DevobotOCE: ey, u played that so well thoough
[0:40:51] DevobotOCE: you basically have it covered
[0:40:56] MaximumnNeo: generally i find spirit form + divine him in open on their cooldowns
[0:41:08] MaximumnNeo: negate them, and then it sup at end of game again
[0:41:12] DevobotOCE: don't forget you have symbol of hope if u need some mana
[0:41:20] LokaJay: You got this
[0:41:35] DevobotOCE: lmao holy serenity is so broken

[0:42:06] DevobotOCE: smite resets chastise
[0:42:21] DevobotOCE: 2 smites in apotheosis is like full chastise cdr
[0:42:22] Lestorphs: is the general thing to do swap cooldowns, to keep up?
[0:43:26] DevobotOCE: best clone i've ever seen
[0:44:06] massiveshade: out of position clone and took forever to get to target

[0:46:14] Geowind: did you enjoy playing holy paladin
[0:46:17] DevobotOCE: also dont be scared to be agggressive with apoth and spam smites
[0:46:20] DevobotOCE: u get tons of chastise
[0:46:34] DevobotOCE: XD
[0:46:38] DevobotOCE: he realized he's playing the wrong spec
[0:46:40] DevobotOCE: you converted him
[0:46:47] DevobotOCE: see, it's just holy priest man
[0:46:54] massiveshade: feels weird that hpriest has as many mini-cds and buttons to click as disc
[0:47:20] DevobotOCE: are you just secretly insane at hpriest or am i a good teacher
[0:47:23] DevobotOCE: pepeLaugh
[0:47:30] LokaJay: Could I get a link to your Shaman later?
[0:47:36] lowenergyjeb_: what was your mmr
[0:48:05] zachgamegodx: Ven have u tried the new dam spec on shaman
[0:48:11] zachgamegodx: as of yesterday
[0:48:31] DevobotOCE: also, there is a nice trick you can do with spirit form.. hunters can drop traps and stuff under it but you can macro a cancelaura spirit with fade so if you see them trap ur angel, before it expires just press the macro and u insta fade and wont get trapped
[0:48:34] DevobotOCE: it's 200 iq
[0:49:36] Sinken420: as of yesterday? what happened yesterday?
[0:49:41] kaljaen: dam spec - shaman turns into beaver and blocks off half of the arena, games always end in a tie
[0:49:52] kaljaen: (i have no idea)
[0:50:06] kaljaen: that was a different person, I just got here
[0:50:14] DevobotOCE: i've converted him
[0:50:16] DevobotOCE: holy priest ggang
[0:50:19] DevobotOCE: ain't need no disc
[0:50:24] zachgamegodx: the big dam spec some ppl are trying is acid rain healing rain with instant healing rain talent w/ like 25-30% haste
[0:50:25] zachgamegodx: max dam spec
[0:50:34] zachgamegodx: with all teh lava burst talents
[0:50:38] DevobotOCE: just abuse smite and resets with chastise, they both got a 30% damage buff

[0:58:33] DevobotOCE: if you make the cancelaura macro u can easily dodge those, surprised he went for it

[1:01:41] massiveshade: kinda glad not every healer has dmg reduction externals
[1:03:23] DevobotOCE: it does suck not having DR externals but I think if holy priest had something like pain sup it'd just be broken
[1:03:33] jadora: Yo ven will you admit crusaders the best player in the game if he wins awc with group finder teammates ?
[1:03:50] massiveshade: Hpriest would have to lose a lot for them to get pain sup
[1:04:01] Xeliumimar: he's a 60x r1
[1:04:07] DevobotOCE: is crusader actually good, i know hes a meme and a tosspot but is he actually a good player hahaha

[1:10:55] drm95x: hes trolling.....
[1:11:00] cyborg1141: I think most rogues aren't pika

[1:12:59] nightmxz: I hate that people keep saying outlaw is immortal, just because we can vanish every 15 seconds we "can't die". What if you just stun us or lock us down so we can't reset our CDs?

[1:15:04] DevobotOCE: or they're dead
[1:15:14] cyborg1141: the dampening

[1:16:43] DevobotOCE: i have all my stuns on Shift T
[1:17:02] cyborg1141: I don't move with the s key I use it for kick, I'm bad tho
[1:17:40] exercisefreak: I think you said this b4 but windwalkers feel weird atm. Feels like ww is the only mele atm with 0 ranged attacks/bleeds and no way to "prevent" cc during serenity

[1:22:01] burekodsira12: holy priest is the most fun healer, but can be frustrating to play
[1:22:30] cyborg1141: I like the shaman healer when they stand in the totems, tey to place them near the target ? Not sure
[1:22:40] Xeliumimar: your gona flash heal a lot as hpriest

[1:30:21] Reythewrecker: food is always worth it
[1:30:32] DevobotOCE: if u think they're going to press their extra crimson vial instead of dam
[1:30:34] DevobotOCE: KEKW

[1:31:54] pragma90: @DevobotOCE how long do people stay full hp in shuffle
[1:32:28] DevobotOCE: in that down time where you're in apoth and not doing anything if u press 2 smites ur chastise is like fully reset
[1:32:31] DevobotOCE: @pragma90 true
[1:33:09] illmind94: "i didnt do that, dont talk to me" lol
[1:33:14] jfachal: are you commentating the AWC ?
[1:33:49] theronpaul: No he's competing 3 amigos is back baby

[1:34:35] DevobotOCE: KEKW
[1:34:38] cyborg1141: Trying to watch and track offensive defense cds while keeping everyone full hp

[1:34:59] Lyricise: Oh dope! I was just coming into your stream to ask your opinon on disc right now, and your playing it
[1:35:00] massiveshade: that's an outlaw rogue, just bomb no duel
[1:35:01] TroyStory__: Full stealth open again
[1:35:06] DevobotOCE: its kind nasty with hunter too, if u manage to line up that chastise - trap - fear
[1:35:40] DevobotOCE: talk about what? i didn't see anything

[1:38:00] mayfire15: holy OP!
[1:38:06] mayfire15: Kappa
[1:38:14] DevobotOCE: ey people be sleeping on the hpriest
[1:38:16] DevobotOCE: it's fun
[1:38:28] bwillyboy: how does holy feel compared to disc?
[1:38:58] mayfire15: both just run out of healing imo
[1:39:06] DevobotOCE: @bwillyboy from watching, I think his tl;dr is.. feels good except not having DR cooldowns makes it feel bad when dampening hits
[1:39:27] bwillyboy: @DevobotOCE totally makes sense. thanks!
[1:39:37] DevobotOCE: which is basically how it goes
[1:39:41] mayfire15: he is just out playing this rdru tho
[1:39:57] cyborg1141: Resto shaman feels really fun in 2s
[1:40:00] DevobotOCE: once you've exhausted double GS, angel, hymn, apoth, etc etc casting flash heals into dampening is downright horrendous
[1:40:06] DevobotOCE: and serenity starts to do like 200k not 400k
[1:40:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Freaking broccoli!
[1:40:11] Ponification: This is like the epitome of low mmr RSS, two melee dps splitting targets the entire game lol
[1:40:16] SteLawBro: Trill was playing holy priest a few weeks back with mes and dew on dps and he was slaying.
[1:40:27] massiveshade: love when dks don't grip the priest that's running up to cc their healer
[1:40:30] DevobotOCE: @SteLawBro hpriest so fun man
[1:40:30] Nickystr1x: rogue thought he could make nunruki sweat
[1:40:32] SteLawBro: Looked solid at the highest of high ratings.
[1:40:41] DevobotOCE: hpriest is really really good in a coordinated team I tihnk
[1:40:53] MathematicalWolf: sup ven, home life is treating you well my dude
[1:40:55] DevobotOCE: just having chastise alone is so nice
[1:41:00] Nickystr1x: @massiveshade as a healer in shuffle it's my experience that priests 100% of the time get to run it down mid for a fear without being stopped
[1:41:07] SteLawBro: This is before all the changes and such recently. Didnt even know trill played healers lol
[1:41:08] DevobotOCE: when I go to disc and I don't have it, I struggle lol
[1:41:27] DevobotOCE: @SteLawBro ah yea, the biggest changes were 30% smite, chastise dam and like 15% flash heal
[1:41:31] DevobotOCE: holy priest experience my man
[1:41:32] mayfire15: @DevobotOCE you are probably just better at holy
[1:41:32] DevobotOCE: welcome
[1:41:39] cyborg1141: XD
[1:41:40] tv_raz: playing with sub 1800 players
[1:41:42] DevobotOCE: @DevobotOCE that is a lot of it yea
[1:41:45] massiveshade: @Nickystr1x yee, that's quite annoying to deal with
[1:41:47] cyborg1141: The dps greed tunnel
[1:41:59] lea0793: disc is more fun
[1:42:02] iwantmoremoney3: man I play both disc and holy but after the patch I can say holy is pretty better than disc
[1:42:05] tv_raz: hardly ever greed tunnel everyone on ther eteam was above 50% xD
[1:42:16] mayfire15: @lea0793 to you lol
[1:42:16] iwantmoremoney3: idk why people say disc is good in shuffle, he’s pretty bad
[1:42:21] DevobotOCE: @mayfire15 but it's also like, I don't really get to do my own setups as disc.. sending fear on it's own is w/e.. not being able to chastise so u can run in like safely and then land the fear is a bit suss sometimes
[1:42:47] DevobotOCE: i don't feel like i have to do that nearly as often on holy
[1:43:03] massiveshade: hpriest is more self-sufficient, and is not as easy to get locked down/off cced
[1:43:22] DevobotOCE: yea true
[1:43:28] lea0793: i pref disc the only thing holy have better tham disc is one cc more
[1:43:38] DevobotOCE: sometimes that one cc is all u need to win
[1:43:40] iwantmoremoney3: also it has stun + fesr setup and good damage
[1:43:49] rekt1370: that one cc more makes it really good into disc lol
[1:43:51] lea0793: true
[1:43:58] DevobotOCE: surely u didn't just mc him behind the pillar then purged his NS
[1:44:01] DevobotOCE: that's tough
[1:44:03] rekt1370: stun fear when the disc just has fear
[1:44:05] Nickystr1x: chastise + fear, with fade to cover if needed, are like nuclear weapons in the healer cc battle
[1:44:13] massiveshade: chastise is a very spammable and ccs for a while
[1:44:17] DevobotOCE: yea hahaha, if u ever vs holy as disc its so sad
[1:44:20] iwantmoremoney3: yes man
[1:44:21] SteLawBro: Was that Velf racial out of root beam? Pretty good use of it.
[1:44:28] DevobotOCE: yea, if u can sit and spam smite u get so much chastise

[1:45:44] dazuu_: what day is awc?
[1:46:33] iwantmoremoney3: the only thing I don’t know it’s how much haste should we run as holy priest… maybe better mastery overall?
[1:46:46] DevobotOCE: pet central hollyyyy
[1:47:00] DevobotOCE: @iwantmoremoney3 mastery is infinitely better yea, haste is totally up to you.. whatever % feels good
[1:47:13] DevobotOCE: it's the exact same as resto shaman
[1:47:15] iwantmoremoney3: mmm
[1:47:20] DevobotOCE: mastery king, but some prefer more haste for some more dam etc
[1:47:29] buttermytoastt: do you use gladius or sarena?
[1:47:37] cyborg1141: Hpal little more crit I think
[1:47:45] massiveshade: still want a decent amount of haste: so your gcd isn't too long and you can get important casts before others
[1:47:54] DevobotOCE: hpal yea
[1:48:02] DevobotOCE: crit is ok on hpriest but not that good in pvp
[1:48:04] DevobotOCE: i think crit is for pve

[2:43:33] Chillatech: yoyoyoo
[2:44:29] Xeliumimar: on disc or holy
[2:44:34] quantumtako: it would be cool if ya know maybe frost dk was meta? even for like 5 minutes would be nice lol
[2:44:43] Vigi9413: can you get tier from every slot in the vault? sorry just coming back to retail
[2:44:44] Chillatech: :O nunruki
[2:44:56] aarongarey1993: 200k gold for 1 game. Sounds good to me
[2:45:14] Xeliumimar: FDK Re-work
[2:45:17] psychic241: pres 2400 push time?!
[2:45:22] quantumtako: lol
[2:45:27] llseattlell: but frost dk has insane cleave.
[2:45:30] galdinator: frost dk = pray enemy doesnt press cds
[2:45:31] What_ln_Tarnation: FDK has same issue sub and fmage has
[2:45:34] llseattlell: slappy hands CC death and decay oblit cleave.
[2:45:37] quantumtako: absolutely requires a fundamental rework
[2:45:38] Secretwombatbro: the first version of frost was even like that, with the ulduar sigil
[2:45:44] californiacal: and yet sub exists
[2:45:46] Triknology: is it just boring?
[2:45:48] ezmoney3434: frost just needs to be a consistent damage instead of burst
[2:45:50] Ultramagnus85: frost dk december never ending
[2:45:52] kwingas: how does it deal damage>
[2:45:56] Badasti: like enhance shamans, feast or famine
[2:46:14] invincibledalyeth: hey man how are you
[2:46:15] Vigi9413: now they just play outlaw
[2:46:32] Devcomz: Yeah all the Rogues seem to have dumped sub and are playing outlaw now
[2:46:35] llseattlell: ahem palumors 1 shot macro didnt work for me i must be bad
[2:46:39] Devcomz: seems like sub dropped off
[2:46:57] Merkflare: if there isnt cheap shot on everyone at all times, you're not subbin right
[2:47:23] Vigi9413: aren't all 3 rogue spec A tier and above?
[2:47:30] loveandsupply: sub is entirely broken, and gets to be meta lot of the time. holding a player in stun is already toxic, adding a smoke bomb makes it worse and shadowy duel is entirely overkill. lol
[2:47:39] invincibledalyeth: same with ret paladin they always overtune them or have them so bad it’s not worth playing
[2:47:43] Juliio29: what’s up Ven and friends
[2:47:45] ShawkTreatment: yeah sub is always fun at the beginning but it always gets hit really hard lol
[2:48:04] Devcomz: @Vigi9413 Assa probably isn't Supatease is doing the Assa challenge and its so far looking like its the most miserable spec. I would say Assa is B in 2s or 3s and C in shuffle
[2:48:11] Vigi9413: in your opinion ven what's the actual like worst dps spec?
[2:48:22] felgazer: What do you think is causing the huge influx of cheaters in pvp?
[2:48:30] invincibledalyeth: frost dk overall I feel is bad
[2:48:46] yaboiq56: whats a spec you're bad at that you wish you were good at?
[2:48:52] thendj: frost dk in a big melee lobby is sick af
[2:48:54] SteLawBro: What spec has the least amount of situations its good? lol
[2:48:56] Devcomz: I dont think warrior is the worst
[2:48:58] Vigi9413: arms feel kinda ass sometimes
[2:49:02] JmanOwnz: people seem to not like enhance these days
[2:49:05] What_ln_Tarnation: if wars arent s+ tier, then war zug brainers will say they worst
[2:49:10] invincibledalyeth: nah war is good
[2:49:10] Datguyjay: arms seems kinda ass because it's not outlaw
[2:49:15] monstersquix: That kind of sound alot like mage..First fire is op and oneshots, so it get nerfed, then arcane is broken bonkers, and then its nerfed then fire is op again, then that gets nerfed and then frost oneshots. Alot like rogues lol
[2:49:16] quantumtako: yeah absolutely not wars can be dominate
[2:49:16] eoi_attritshun: i love arms
[2:49:18] Aetecii: fury well played is low key good
[2:49:30] DirtyYankee0: KEKW @Datguyjay
[2:49:35] Thrells: its obviously a tie between frostdk and feral for worst spec
[2:49:39] Triknology: you sound like Scooby Doo when you say ret rogue
[2:49:44] SteLawBro: I tried arms randomly and it was a blast. You can just run around and kind of do whatever.
[2:49:49] Devcomz: I would say based on watching streams seems like Frost DK Assa Rogue, Fire Mage are the worst and maybe Aff lock
[2:49:49] Juliio29: fury is just miserable into dragon/magus which are both good at high rating lol
[2:49:50] Vigi9413: i used the boost from buying the war within on ret and it just already out damages my warrior lmao
[2:49:54] Juliio29: warrior **
[2:49:55] ralotheret: Rets damage feels so much better now
[2:50:02] JmanOwnz: holy shit that's why it's called scooby do cleave
[2:50:05] JmanOwnz: never knew lol
[2:50:12] Mood1001: I'm leveling my warrior rn for solo I hope it's not ass
[2:50:17] monstersquix: Roll the bones
[2:50:17] tigerslap_ow: its your dmg
[2:50:19] BUNNZl: between the eyes
[2:50:20] bonaphil: between the eyes
[2:50:21] citizx: ROLLING
[2:50:23] BUNNZl: will always crit
[2:50:23] DirtyYankee0: between the eyes 4x crit dmg @venruki
[2:50:23] gdodmebxu: between the eyes with shark buff
[2:50:24] zachgamegodx: between the eyes does 400% dmg if it crits
[2:50:25] invincibledalyeth: between the eyes
[2:50:25] gdodmebxu: 100% crit
[2:50:27] thendj: bonus combo points on crit plust between the eyes buffing more crit damage
[2:50:27] BUNNZl: at 40 percent
[2:50:30] BUNNZl: with shark buff
[2:50:31] HoopleBogart: 3 different answers right off the bat Clap
[2:50:32] Juliio29: ret does a lot of damage, but you don’t have MS and can die really easy against good players lol
[2:50:38] Aetecii: As Ret I can solo a healer on a switch now feels good but also like I shouldn't be able to
[2:50:45] ryanblue98: The meta is casters which being a war is ass right now vs all casters
[2:50:58] invincibledalyeth: crit for outlaw is like fire mage where it helps you get procs for pistol shot that’s buffed
[2:51:17] loveandsupply: did they nert ret on Wednesday’s hot fix? feels useless again lol and now squishy with the new pvp armor nerf/buff
[2:51:32] DirtyYankee0: ret is great rn lmao what @loveandsupply
[2:51:41] Aetecii: @loveandsupply no big dmg buff
[2:51:57] Aetecii: You must be doing something wrong haha
[2:52:02] DirtyYankee0: forsure
[2:52:09] loveandsupply: okay, bet I was hoping not. I main ret and was wanting to get back in it
[2:52:16] DirtyYankee0: ret feels great rn
[2:52:23] DirtyYankee0: love its design and strength
[2:52:24] Aetecii: Yeah, main ret here it does feel good
[2:52:54] schdenfreude: His shaman prob
[2:53:41] NozakGaming: Ive been running inner light against shams and druids and i dont oom as bad before they do.
[2:53:42] Aetecii: Look the ret's dmg it completly dominats rmp lol
[2:53:54] loveandsupply: if only que times were shorter, I wouldn’t mind it being at a cost of closing the gap of mmr with matchmaking
[2:53:57] HoopleBogart: FeelsBadEh
[2:54:01] princesstoni01: princesstoni01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 5 month streak! hey :3

[2:55:47] Merkflare: gamer
[2:56:00] princesstoni01: you two should make out already
[2:56:54] loveandsupply: paladins deserve a second dps spec with the use of one hand sword and sheild lol

[2:57:37] llseattlell: bdk meta is real thank you ven
[2:57:48] obviouslytai: was a good altar
[2:57:51] atrain742: crazy alter
[2:57:52] DirtyYankee0: between the eyes 4x crit dmg is why you want so much crit as outlaw @venruki
[2:57:55] Mckriminal: @venruki  Hi what mage spec do you find the most fun to play atm
[2:57:57] Triknology: Is BM fun, or is it just default because MM kind of sucks?
[2:57:58] lolcatxo: the mage on my team never presses poly
[2:58:00] obviouslytai: 10 percent gamer
[2:58:00] smitesucks: i think they need more support style specs then give a few healers specs more offensive agency
[2:58:41] DirtyYankee0: outlaw is super speed
[2:58:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: EZ sap
[2:58:44] seraph_wow: 100% stepped
[2:58:45] Yaycarrots: remember when stealth slowed you down? rukiHmm
[2:58:45] atrain742: shimmer > floes
[2:58:46] DirtyYankee0: fastest rogue spec
[2:58:50] obviouslytai: step makes it feel fast
[2:59:06] obviouslytai: oh yea the hook too
[2:59:21] DirtyYankee0: hook +15% more movespeed compared to other rog specs
[2:59:41] Yaycarrots: hahah
[2:59:44] obviouslytai: lmao nooo
[2:59:50] atrain742: just poor timing
[2:59:52] invincibledalyeth: wow that’s so crappy
[2:59:56] dorkpally: everytime someone says ret/rogue, i hear scooby.. never fails
[3:00:38] DirtyYankee0: well then KEKW

[3:01:02] Somanie: cashed the shit outta that bowl
[3:01:04] llseattlell: 3-0 if we count my game with ven
[3:01:16] SteLawBro: @smitesucks When i think of support specs i feel like thats tthe perfect role for tanks. I'd love to see tanks in PVP if a dedicated team did it properly.
[3:01:29] DirtyYankee0: youre alone on that one @SteLawBro
[3:01:36] DirtyYankee0: tank specs shouldnt be allowed in pvp
[3:01:40] SteLawBro: Thats why i said did it properly lol
[3:01:48] SteLawBro: Not annoyingly
[3:02:05] malvarcla: doing it annoyingly is doing it the proper way
[3:02:26] schdenfreude: It's hard to balance shit how it is imagine adding another layer with tanks, literally impossible for blizz

[3:08:27] seanwheeler823: pvp tier list when?\
[3:08:30] zagabombs: its fun its just not good enough :(
[3:08:30] massiveshade: rsham feels like a counter pick instead of a stable healer right now
[3:08:33] JmanOwnz: ngl i have to have a weak aura otherwise it's tough for me to even see grounding totem on some maps
[3:08:34] Guidry: man its rough coming back to shuff trying to get gear lol
[3:08:40] JmanOwnz: i mean earthen totem&
[3:08:42] obviouslytai: just give shamans earthen as a non dispelable debuff
[3:08:42] 7osei: disc and rdruid have always felt like the most appealing healers for me
[3:08:47] vmills: damage reduction is so good when damping ramps up. tried holy priest the other day and it felt like such a struggle
[3:08:49] obviouslytai: buff*
[3:09:15] Badasti: i think they also nerfed the conquest gained from shuffle no? feels slower than before for some reason
[3:09:24] kurogekos: You can gear any char with a healer in solo shuffle
[3:09:25] 受種狂魔: ggs man,ret here
[3:09:40] callehc: Destro lock good class/spec for a new retail player (played mostly tbc pvp)?
[3:09:59] drdoomkinx: ret hunter priest has infinite Cc
[3:10:10] Salanzo: ret/bm/dpriest is just overwhelming dmg and cc permanently
[3:10:12] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: how do you have so m,uch gold on an alt man
[3:10:14] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: shiee
[3:10:17] massiveshade: @callehc destro has an easy rotation to learn, but learning how to survive as an immobile caster in retail is a curve
[3:10:19] Snowfather: !song
[3:10:19] Nightbot: Enable the AHA Music Identifier to find out the song! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-music-identifie/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en

[3:10:42] healhut: i keep waiting for the return of our ret/demo over lords
[3:10:46] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: gotta farm myself hartd

[3:11:29] tigerslap_ow: do you feel slow?
[3:11:33] What_ln_Tarnation: vers is DRing hard now with S3 ilvls
[3:11:38] obviouslytai: @venruki healing rets in this high damage meta is a bit rough. its almost feels like healing a mage that doesnt kite.
[3:11:39] metel7: !Holzkern

[3:12:07] What_ln_Tarnation: i made some haste/mastery gear to get rid of some vers
[3:12:13] massiveshade: think blizz is going to make destro/fire busted for the last season per usual
[3:12:25] massiveshade: wizards are going to make a come back
[3:12:47] thendj: arent wizards insane at top off ladder anyways
[3:12:48] lowenergyjeb_: and i have 22% haste and 61% mastery when scaled
[3:12:48] Secretwombatbro: revert shadow to s1
[3:12:55] Secretwombatbro: and painbreak psalm
[3:12:59] Badasti: i feel like literally every season melee players run around calling it a wizard meta
[3:13:16] Salanzo: melee players got a melee meta the entire xpac and wizards have a couple of viable comps and everyone freaks out
[3:13:19] healhut: dev/arcane looked nasty watching kubzy and chun the other night
[3:13:20] Badasti: even this season where dk's dh's and warriors are all more represented
[3:13:24] 7osei: melee metas are usually quite toxic though
[3:13:27] gdodmebxu: @Badasti they chase wizards around the pillar with 0 defensives and die KEKW
[3:13:47] wowsuomi: Bind new trinket
[3:13:52] massiveshade: DF and SL have been a melee dominate
[3:14:07] vmills: @badasti Lolol you get 1 wizard comp out of every 5 and it’s a wizard meta
[3:14:28] massiveshade: most caster metas aren't even true wizards
[3:14:39] lowenergyjeb_: the catalyst can change cloak to haste mastery
[3:15:09] 7osei: melee/ranged/healer comps have always been the most funt to play for me
[3:15:31] Akkaryn501: Any change in the casting crew? Not seen an announcement
[3:15:52] massiveshade: melee/ranged/healer have the most naunced unless it's rogue meta
[3:15:54] sourbutts: its ven
[3:15:58] Merkflare: gotta be
[3:16:01] heenrique171096: awc in 3 days?

[3:16:26] JokeHoleToilet: hostage tape? lol
[3:16:26] Somanie: @Merkflare same
[3:16:31] willie_stroker_99: Change your pillow
[3:16:36] ShortyDewOp13: You should get a sleep study, make sure you don't have sleep apnea
[3:16:40] eoi_attritshun: elevate yourself with an extra pillow..trust I have same problem
[3:16:48] Merkflare: rich was a funny third man
[3:16:52] sourbutts: have you tried not snoring?
[3:16:55] eoi_attritshun: yea
[3:16:57] Miekstro: inflammation from certain foods can cause
[3:16:57] bloodbuckets: CPAP ftw
[3:17:09] Rands60: how do you snore with mouth tape lol I did not even know that was possible
[3:17:11] lowenergyjeb_: a jet mask
[3:17:16] Badasti: thats for sleep apnea not snoring
[3:17:17] ShortyDewOp13: its amazing
[3:17:19] Guidry: doubt you need a cpap lol
[3:17:20] thendj: no joke mouth tape has a been a game changer
[3:17:21] Rands60: mouth tape fixed my snoring
[3:17:28] bloodbuckets: if you wake yourself, you are not getting enough sleep.  CPAP is a game changer
[3:17:28] Somanie: I CiGrip so I snore too lol
[3:17:32] imjudgy: yea, so many people snore and dont realize it causes a lack of oxygen when you are sleeping. This could turn into many more health problems that stem from lack of oxygen and can lead to organ dmg.
[3:17:43] vmills: you might actually need it. can be scary if you need it and not use one.
[3:18:06] Emerno: "Prime Subscriptions are not available in your country." why do i get this message on firefox lol this is Canada bruv
[3:18:10] Salanzo: i didnt even know you had TTS lol
[3:18:13] ShortyDewOp13: Sleep studies are relatively inexpensive, will show if you have apnea or not
[3:18:13] healhut: just get some earmuffs for your wife SeemsGood
[3:19:02] bwillyboy: @Emerno could be how it sees your IP

[3:20:11] massiveshade: is that an augvoker?
[3:20:19] Snoogns: that's why I always have a /use13 and /use14 macro
[3:20:34] egrounds: that's not how it works my man, it's your toungue falling in the back of your throat. I have a cpap and it saved my life. I tried mouth pieces and night guards, that is trash, unless you get a machine or the surgery it's all worthless and gimmicks. Get a sleep study and figure out if you need it.
[3:20:42] bootymcboatface22: that’s so cringe, healing pets

[3:26:08] pragma90: LOL that actually looks fun to play... why play healer when you can do that
[3:26:25] betasoldier: wtf is happening, got on my dh and have gotten into 3 back to back solo shuffles with less than 30 seconds of queue time total, i waited in a 1 minute queue on my resto druid, not complaining but confused
[3:26:56] massiveshade: think this ele is scripting
[3:27:13] blkylol: @massiveshade possibly
[3:27:18] GadgetCopter: that ele's thumb has to be sore from all of that space bar

[3:42:51] williwhite94: i legit eat 4k cals tracked daily and im around 7% BF year around i have proff if needed
[3:42:53] ozzyxy: my metabolism is  JACKED
[3:43:00] Somanie: I think metabolism is hormonal
[3:43:01] zinisterzz: its impossible to replicate enviroment over a long enough period to verify that no?
[3:43:09] massiveshade: you digest faster, but it does not mean you absorb nutrition as fast/efficiently
[3:43:11] Schwantes2: your body has energy saving mechanisms. it can save up to 25%
[3:43:12] strafekey: if you eat more frequently through out the day you can manipulate it to speed up and vice versa if you only eat like 2 big meals throughout the day
[3:43:14] williwhite94: i play wow all day
[3:43:14] atrain742: Explains why bodybuilders can eat more

[3:43:51] dassant: I think it'S more that people with a "fast metabolism" don't extract the nutrients as wells a possible from the food
[3:44:05] Triknology: @dassant not true
[3:44:06] BCboy_: 8 second trap into a gpie cast is a scary sight
[3:44:24] williwhite94: @Triknology thats more gut microbiome
[3:44:33] MathematicalWolf: how’s MMR inflation this season?
[3:44:51] massiveshade: think people are using the term metabolism wrong
[3:45:04] massiveshade: disgesting fasting doesn't mean "fast metabolism"
[3:45:48] Somanie: means your body processes all of it faster, including using it up
[3:45:51] Somanie: so it's part of it
[3:45:59] Somanie: I still think it's hormonal
[3:46:11] Ey_an: its a thing
[3:46:18] Ey_an: if u eat more its faster if u eat less its slower
[3:46:23] Ey_an: it doesn't cross
[3:46:41] eoi_attritshun: if there is a low metabo by definition isn't there a fast?
[3:46:43] ArmyofOneGuy: ya some people jsut burn more calories in a resting state
[3:46:48] Guidry: it depends on your muscle mass/ heigh/ activity level
[3:46:55] Merkflare: something to consider, if you're metabolism is slow, and you're overweight storing fat, the solution is still to consume less calories
[3:46:57] BCboy_: NOTED need to see the research
[3:47:17] Guidry: no one that sits on their ass all day has a fast metabolism
[3:47:17] Somanie: your thyroid contributes a lot to your metabolic rate
[3:47:18] ArmyofOneGuy: oh ya most people for sure under eat on calories that say that, it is a thing though
[3:47:25] massiveshade: fast metabolism means you absorb the actual calories/nutrition at a good rate
[3:47:31] Merkflare: to gain weight you also have to spread meals out in the day, from the traditional 3 to 6 or more
[3:47:34] staxx23: i didnt start gaining weight until i switched to a whole foods diet.
[3:47:38] massiveshade: which can also mean eating little but also get basically of all the stuff you eat
[3:47:47] massiveshade: absorbing*
[3:47:51] kodera8: u don’t have to spread meals to gain weight lol
[3:47:59] ButtaTWD: even medical school doesn’t teach it properly when I finished the first 2 years we had roughly 2 weeks on nutrition but that just goes to show the principle of medicine in the US - would rather toss drugs to solve a problem
[3:48:07] ArmyofOneGuy: its all about calorie intake vs burned
[3:48:16] dassant: quick google search suggests, that the difference between fast and slow metabolism is in the range of 300kcal per day. So not really huge
[3:48:20] Solastro: was in a shuffle earlier with this priest who had over 5000 shuffle rounds played this season
[3:48:25] Solastro: how does someone not go insane
[3:48:26] Merkflare: you cant just eat 1 or 2 meals and expect your body to store all those calories
[3:48:45] Mckriminal: yes you gain weight when you eat more calorie than you burn...
[3:48:57] pragma90: @Solastro they have entered the void, nothing can phase them now
[3:49:01] my_feethurt: Take a spoonful of olive oil before every meal you WILL gain weight ur welcome
[3:49:03] kodera8: for sure, i’m just saying it’s not impossible, based on what some people were saying here
[3:49:09] dmason828: its literally just science. calories in. calories out
[3:49:14] smitesucks: i had a obese friend that would go home and eat an entire cake and half a gallon of milk just as a bedtime snack
[3:49:51] staxx23: if you want to gain some unhealthy weight, drink 24 natty lights a day.
[3:50:11] atrain742: Ven your the only other person I know that likes Atreyu

[3:51:07] massiveshade: still have to condition yourself to break the mold
[3:51:20] Merkflare: only you can do that
[3:51:30] massiveshade: and that's not easy, can't just break 10-20 years of a habit any time soon
[3:51:33] Merkflare: unless you're a prisoner of war or somthing
[3:51:36] renwen7: Wish there was something that just auto tracked calories as you ate them, would be a game changer

[3:55:29] massiveshade: esp if you eat the same/similar stuff every day
[3:55:33] dmason828: it becomes something where you just kinda know what calories something has
[3:55:44] PunishedLrnz: Most calorie tracker appa also let you scan the item wich is handy

[4:08:11] Puffeynick: I'm more interested about the legendary thunderfury bow imho!! heck yeaaah
[4:08:11] Vigi9413: it'll feel bad for the people who earned it
[4:08:12] IrishEthics: i think they should bring back unobtainables on a schedule, like timewalking for the ZA bear, scale the dungs to make them hard so its still difficult to get
[4:08:15] DegStaerian: is any1 from back then still playing? idc rewards are king, so give em
[4:08:27] gracioussatan: WoW players are so snobby about their exclusive crap
[4:08:31] darkvsgrim: Good, what if you started a few patches later and now you could get one but you can't. Things should stay unique only for a period of time tbh
[4:08:32] rivellana: i have mop challenge mode mounts and three aotc mounts and if they wanna add those to trading post too so more ppl can get them, i'm all for it
[4:08:39] xSavageALx: do you mix your protein powder with your oatmeal or keep seperate?
[4:08:43] Vigi9413: maybe if they recolor it like the amani bear
[4:09:00] gracioussatan: when it gets opened up for the masses
[4:09:10] healhut: Eventually they'll just put them on sale in the shop. Or turn in the trading post into the shop
[4:09:10] Sheepyou: wait until Spectral Tiger comes to Trading Post and everyone goes crazy LUL
[4:09:11] druidboy4: whatcha eating ven??
[4:09:13] buffnac: it'd be kinda cool if they added some of the lesser TCG mounts that you cant get anymore not the crazy ones though obviously

[4:11:52] Sheepyou: @venruki yea cola, ice tea etc damn nice
