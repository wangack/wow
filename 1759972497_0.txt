[0:37:00] Hizuru1: *sooner
[0:37:26] Molvonos: Valor left over will likely be converted to gold, as is typically done.

[0:41:38] Hizuru1: *weak in pve
[0:41:45] Molvonos: I DPS M+ and Raid Heal, I have different sets.
[0:41:47] Molvonos: Its doable.

[1:17:48] Hizuru1: @xEvOxShadow that would require creativity
[1:17:54] Molvonos: I think they need to have better quantifiers as to what affixes end up together.  Bursting and Grevious, for example, shouldnt happen.
[1:18:00] stabzmcgeee: give us positive affixs instead of just pure punishment
[1:18:01] Molvonos: Or Quaking and Volcanic.
[1:18:07] pavepawns: i kinda want a new affix legit based on the dragonflights. and its only a bonus affix. something where each week it rotates a positive effect depending on which flight is aiding you in the dungeon

[1:58:16] HolySpiritActiv8: oh I thought the priest was the pally one
[1:58:17] ArcaneSyntax: Zooming on the detail on the paladin one is actually really nice, the chest is a unique 3d piece.

[1:59:31] KaisenSiru: Iridikron Pog
[1:59:36] Merqury3: he looks a bit like Ifrit

[1:59:52] aetraxis: We got the bad ass void god plate shoulders in 8.2, these shoulders are so lit
[1:59:59] snake_like: kind of crazy to see the positive reception to Iridikron compared to the Jailer
[2:00:00] HolySpiritActiv8: they look like they go sideways LUL
[2:00:10] Lestatis: 100%

[2:01:00] zarod89: I already like the earth guy more than jailer
[2:01:08] aetraxis: I just think it's funny that these writers are the same one who made the Jailer, Yet these 3 characters have 1000 times more identity and charisma to them. Wonder what changed
[2:01:09] HAMMERRAZOR: the dudes are like venom and carnage
[2:01:09] NVbrutal: they are gonna bring neltharion back to life
[2:01:10] Bayne77: well fire being unstable and ice being cool and calm?

[2:03:10] flebbooo: Ain't no way Scalecommander's basic model gonna be an end boss, he gotta be corrupted
[2:03:10] aetraxis: @snake_like 100% I think Iridikron is going to forcefully absorp his siblings to power something that resurrects galakrond
[2:03:25] FrankTizzle: So old gods confirmed as eventually baddie?

[2:06:22] KaisenSiru: fandyThink fandyThink fandyThink
[2:06:24] flebbooo: KEKW
[2:06:29] DeanoTV: zeggg LUL
[2:06:40] aetraxis: @muzzlol but it just makes sense. They have the perfect time to do it, AND during the dragonflight story we get whispered to directly by nzoth
[2:06:42] Hizuru1: THd whines constantly
[2:06:45] Hizuru1: You cant tell KEKW
[2:06:47] ItsGlime: PepeLaugh
[2:06:48] abracka_: THD towCopium
[2:06:56] ThaDutchZerg: @LoseAlotLuke  Yes? Kappa

[2:07:23] Thdlock: mythic same time as heroic
[2:07:23] board4life65: crest
[2:07:23] Korupcija_: @Thdlock thank you for testing in advance
[2:07:24] FrankTizzle: @Towelliee M+ cap during Heroic week
[2:07:27] demiralos: ilvl cap yes
[2:07:36] stabzmcgeee: "the pantheon shattered the old gods and chained the FIVE evil gods together" is an actual peice of lore
[2:07:40] Thdlock: yes
[2:07:48] Thdlock: rather have m+ be uncapped and mythic 1 week later
[2:07:48] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[2:07:50] Thdlock: best of both worlds
[2:07:55] Hizuru1: FACTS
[2:07:59] Aquadriel: simultaneous release is the best thing ever
[2:07:59] Frostfury: But if there is no capped valor in S2 that is jackpot right there
[2:08:05] abracka_: lets be real they're only dropping all the raid difficulties at the same time so it can launch may 16th before D4 drops
[2:08:08] Hizuru1: it makePREACH MAX
[2:08:10] Molvonos: @Frostfury no valor in s2
[2:08:14] Arbszy: Scripe had a great tweet.
[2:08:31] Thdlock: end of dungeon
[2:08:31] r0b928: r0b928 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[2:08:34] Frostfury: @Frostfury Ohhhh?
[2:08:43] xrandomdoodx: they want 1 week to farm M+/heroic for mythic raid a week later
[2:09:11] Hizuru1: Literally no one is positively effected
[2:09:33] ItsGlime: Kappa
[2:09:33] Arbszy: *Hears me playing my little violin.
[2:09:35] aetraxis: Who is negatively effected?
[2:09:35] Aquadriel: nice cap
[2:09:36] abracka_: ya ok bud
[2:09:36] Korupcija_: Kappa
[2:09:36] Sandisy: Kappa
[2:09:36] Reckless_Monk: Cap
[2:09:37] board4life65: Kappa
[2:09:37] abracka_: LOL

[2:09:48] captain_khyzan: lul
[2:09:50] raldrik: towStop towIt
[2:09:51] Aquadriel: That was the most bullshit thing Max has ever said, and i love the dude
[2:09:51] flebbooo: KEKW
[2:09:55] rbolude: the money okay, but if you dont do it for winning???
[2:09:55] nocturnal_2195: towCopium
[2:09:59] Sollice: I didn't like all tiers releasing at once as a viewer because of the splits they were doing
[2:10:07] LUKA_THIM: so fun 24 hour raiding
[2:10:12] Reckless_Monk: Mega Cap.. WF guilds love having the community suck them off
[2:10:17] stabzmcgeee: sir thats a lie
[2:10:30] Aquadriel: You wouldnt do this kinda shit if there was not a nice amount of money involved KEKW

[2:11:09] Reckless_Monk: vault is good
[2:11:09] Thdlock: @Aquadriel, i mean not really we all did it before there was money and the money is not insane
[2:11:13] Thdlock: if i wanted to make money i do smth else
[2:11:15] Aquadriel: I mean seems like a 'you' problem, just dont beat the raid on week one bro KEKW
[2:11:15] HolySpiritActiv8: I think he just means raz makes the raid bad
[2:11:19] aetraxis: Dragonflight is very very casual friendly
[2:11:19] Thdlock: why do you think ben stopped
[2:11:24] Thdlock: he makes more money doing poe
[2:11:28] Thoreya: xyro got ethered on his tweet. saying the community didnt ask for this, like bro who ru speaking for LUL
[2:11:32] Thdlock: why do you think ben went to method that 1 time
[2:11:33] xrandomdoodx: I think he just means the RWF experience is shit lol
[2:11:34] Thdlock: because he got money
[2:11:40] Thdlock: if u think we make money ur living an illusion
[2:11:41] HolySpiritActiv8: I liked the raid too but raz being overtuned did take away from the fun
[2:11:50] r0b928: Did you beat ragnarok?
[2:12:05] Gingerprimer: Like if THD wanted to make money he would just acutall stream
[2:12:11] aetraxis: I think having an extremely hard first tier after changing the talent system is a good thing. Allows blizzard to tune efficively
[2:12:17] Arbszy: More nerfs, let them suffer for weeks.
[2:12:19] FrankTizzle: Wait is Ben fully PoE now?
[2:12:28] darkkilla1: lets be honest blizz uses RWF for soft tuning

[2:12:31] Thdlock: @FrankTizzle, yep tuning last tier with the same time release made him leave
[2:12:44] FrankTizzle: FeelsBadMan
[2:12:45] bigxukdog: Anyone know the addon you mouse over and it flys out in a circle? it's useful for buffing/etc
[2:12:48] Aquadriel: Yeah but would you keep doing it at this lvl for so many years if there was NO money involved? prolly not, cause a lot of that money I assume goes to pay for analysts and other things, which is necessary to perform at that lvl.
[2:12:52] Zettabyte: Good morning towHAMUP
[2:12:54] sdpercussion: they have to bc its not tested
[2:12:54] Thdlock: @Aquadriel, i would 100%
[2:12:59] faulen: They TimeGated it
[2:13:01] Thdlock: i did it for years before i got any money lmao
[2:13:03] sdpercussion: they cant adjust until they get data from those 2 guilds
[2:13:09] stabzmcgeee: @johnnyjongo opie maybe
[2:13:09] HolySpiritActiv8: yeah blizz let the world first racers be the one to tune the raid instead of just paying people to do it before release
[2:13:23] Hizuru1: rare THD W
[2:13:25] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Exclusive Dragonflight 10.1 Interview with WoW Game Directors youtu.be/X6B1skgZrlA
[2:13:33] xrandomdoodx: They should just test all bosses on PTR again so tuning isn't totally fucked for them
[2:13:39] aetraxis: Realistically Limit/Method/Echo are unpaid beta testers/QA
[2:13:57] Sayryn: When I watch RWF I want to see RWF not split hell.
[2:14:02] so_much_this: World of mythicCraft
[2:14:18] board4life65: diablo 4 !!!
[2:14:22] dimofodi: TBH more people lose with THD suggestions. There's mythic guilds that can get a mythic vault slot first week that don't do RWF that would lose out. The number of those guilds outweigh the RWF I would think.
[2:14:24] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee it was but now it is D4
[2:14:43] Sayryn: Days of splits
[2:14:44] Delkamus04: splits
[2:14:47] Deusey: splits are boring to watch
[2:14:53] bigoldmeatpie: outside of raz, definitely splits
[2:14:55] sdpercussion: Also - It was like 11am and Limit wasn't out of bed when the boss went down. I'd have had my guys in their chairs by 8am if the boss was that close to dead
[2:15:00] Lycis: If the tuning is fkd that even a WF guild cant beat them, then its becoming really stupid
[2:15:20] TheGiant99: Seems like just alot of complaining for the sake of complaining. It's there choice to play the way they do
[2:15:20] sdpercussion: then theyd have been in the raid when the nerf went through at least
[2:15:24] Hizuru1: @dimwhat nonsense did I just read
[2:15:38] BigDiezel: @Towelliee it was also around christmas though
[2:15:44] Reckless_Monk: I mean Blizzard losing popularity also hit viewership
[2:15:45] D0tmatic: shadowlands also had covid lockdown
[2:16:00] RocketMan23: when there was a heroic week, wasnt that just a whole week of splits anyway?

[2:16:22] Alienfromger: with other words... its boring
[2:16:35] Thdlock: it was the schedule peopled tuned in and asked bout splits for days
[2:16:38] Thdlock: and just didnt tune back in
[2:16:43] Arbszy: The Race is Zzzzzzzz
[2:16:46] Thdlock: and any new guy tuning in left and never thought of it
[2:16:50] szble: Yeah rwf is boring
[2:16:54] captain_khyzan: i think in general less ppl are interested, same top guilds funded by unrelatable amount of money, degen behavior (splits), and then having to be tweaked by blizzard constantly to make it doable
[2:16:57] Hizuru1: well they made game for people who spend more time on twitter than in game.
[2:16:58] Ertra: yeah i didn't watch this last race, it was super boring
[2:17:00] Hizuru1: @Thdlock true
[2:17:02] TheGiant99: How much of the player base actually cares about that race
[2:17:09] Sayryn: PULL THE RIPCORD
[2:17:19] D0tmatic: someone new cant just jump in and watch RWF and understand wtf is happening on the screen lol
[2:17:20] 위캔어퍼: excuse me chat, what does 'mirror' means in Maximum tweet? (Making 10 mirrors sucks but it's worth it because we get to do this thing every 6 months.)
[2:17:29] Arbszy: @Thdlock What you need to do is raid with Sfia more ;)
[2:17:30] Hizuru1: he is right
[2:17:40] Aquadriel: "whole community" LMAO
[2:17:42] Snabido: 'Whole' huh 😏
[2:17:47] zarod89: the whole community lmao
[2:17:48] Reckless_Monk: True
[2:17:49] Caloz7: makes no diff to me couldnt care less
[2:17:50] ronny_84: maybe its just the timing, christmas soon after release.. and then diablo 4 releasing like a month after
[2:17:54] zarod89: 99% of the community wont care
[2:17:55] Thdlock: he didnt clarify xyro is for uncapped M+ week 1
[2:17:55] Lestatis: only a sith deals in absolutes
[2:17:57] Bayne77: no absolutes
[2:17:57] Hizuru1: He does literally anyone who can do that never asked for it.
[2:17:59] Thdlock: he jus thates mythic with heroic
[2:18:00] flebbooo: don't speak for me Madge

[2:25:56] FrankTizzle: YEP
[2:25:58] szble: This isn’t clicking for me
[2:26:04] CeruleanStar: read you had to do either 17+ or H raid to upgrade stuff to max
[2:26:04] Molvonos: Yea
[2:26:09] BlueBlurPrime: yes valor is gone
[2:26:11] gooni_coyg: yep Valor is gone
[2:26:13] Draz3nx: is this a bowered power system

[2:29:51] Korupcija_: I'm bored of valor already
[2:29:52] MrCheshireCat_: so valor will be untill 10.1 lunches?
[2:29:59] biirrd: you can only upgrade a item 8 times
[2:30:07] Sollice: @Towelliee We will get it working dont worry
[2:30:09] biirrd: so you need to find a higher item to keep upgrade
[2:30:10] KaisenSiru: Pog
[2:30:13] Sollice: We dont want to deal with moobot whispers
[2:30:15] zarod89: I mean you wouldnt replace something like honor/conquest just to keep it interesting
[2:30:18] zarod89: if it works
[2:30:21] Hizuru1: So what was first cap then?
[2:30:35] Gragnar: only part I don't like is that a normal item can only be upgraded up to mid-heroic, LFR up to mid normal, outdoor up to mid LFR levels
[2:30:43] CeruleanStar: hmmm i really need to figure out what alt i want to get cuaght up

[2:34:54] Thdlock: lmao
[2:35:00] reggiepowa: @troymcclurre if you want to upgrade gear you'll have to do content equal to the ilvl you want to upgrade to

[2:36:45] darkkilla1: but wouldnt the time it takes to farm that up = same time to just do it on your main first
[2:36:47] reggiepowa: I feel like you will have so much flightstones on your main it won't even matter
[2:36:54] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is the sweaty way lol
[2:37:02] DarthWrex: Keep reading pretty sure it says Alts still pay a crest but half the flightstones

[2:41:28] pavepawns: we will see how it feels on ptr
[2:41:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: This system is more for people in the middle, the highest gear doesn't get upgraded

[2:41:44] Dackor: It lays the groundwork for better designed game-wide upgrade systems in the future
[2:41:46] mavericks312: @hizuru1 never gonna happen they don’t want ppl max ilvl of a new patch day 1
[2:41:51] D1Chile: @Towelliee  it mostrly so they dont have 3 different curency  / valor infusion whatever the storm curency is etc
[2:42:05] reggiepowa: @weirdo_dude yeah same like now, you won't be able to upgrade past 415 ilvl in current ilvls
[2:43:11] Hizuru1: @mavericks312 aha and 3 months in season being that case changes what?
[2:43:29] Mr_Pennywise_: Dance Dance Dance Dance
[2:43:29] Hizuru1: @mavericks312 if you st art now you can do that now.

[3:11:19] lucid_wow: the passive alt catchup mechanic is so good
[3:11:19] 17Firstblood75: @Towelliee where is the valor change info? i missed it and wanna read it
[3:11:20] TheZander: And you can make normal/hc raid gear last longer
[3:11:36] BurtMacklin410: with the new system you can upgrade to first boss mythic ilvl, Basically the same as you can now
[3:11:37] mobbo: You won’t be able to take an item from a 2 and upgrade it the whole way I think is what they’re saying
[3:11:42] bigoldmeatpie: @17Firstblood75 wowhead has the full blue post
[3:11:52] Hizuru1: Valor is crap
[3:11:52] polaropposite76: doesn't really seem complicated to me
[3:11:58] Gragnar: only difference is you probably can't spam +2s to get the trinket you want and then upgrade it to mythic level because it can only upgrade 7 times @Towelliee
[3:12:02] ThePointGaming: but this is the a new 'future proofing' system
[3:12:03] Hizuru1: should be deletd spaming 5000th +2 so you can upgrade 1 item is stupid
[3:12:14] dracullus: why not just give me mythic gear
[3:12:20] Fawcheddar: both can work - valor dropping from everything was my thought on the easiest route

[3:12:44] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[3:12:45] abracka_: lock it behind needing to do X amount of something like the current system is lol
[3:12:46] Thdlock: for the very rare items
[3:12:49] Thdlock: to upgrade em tho
[3:12:56] abracka_: you can't upgrade mythic+ gear to 415 without having 2400 IO
[3:13:00] Mecabeast: This is the way
[3:13:16] ThePointGaming: its so they can take this new currency and move it into the next expansion and itll make sense, just change the flavor name
[3:13:21] Thdlock: yes
[3:13:21] TheGiant99: But does it really matter if a casual player is able to upgrade to mythic level gear
[3:13:23] ItsMorecowbell: So the different tier crests drop from their respective raid tiers? so it's really just going to reduce how much you have to farm each tier for your gear?
[3:13:31] bigoldmeatpie: back to dragon soul with farming LFR
[3:13:33] TheZander: No you dont
[3:13:37] TheZander: yes they do
[3:13:42] Yieiw: i dont think you do
[3:13:42] kriiuss: It says you dont
[3:13:45] kraydom: They did mention KSM and KSH
[3:13:47] D1Chile: u dont they did mention iot
[3:13:47] kriiuss: I think
[3:13:48] BurtMacklin410: BurtMacklin410 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! Not really much changes with this new system. With this new system you can still upgrade mythic+ loot to beginning of mythic raid ilvl loot.
[3:13:52] Gragnar: rating is only for achieves and bonus flightstones

[3:13:55] mobbo: You don’t I believe it said
[3:14:04] mobbo: ^
[3:14:07] kraydom: Ctrl F KSM
[3:14:09] reggiepowa: no you just get crests from hard content
[3:14:09] jarilrpg: they mentioned it that you dont need it to upgrade
[3:14:13] mobbo: Ctrl+F
[3:14:21] ItsMorecowbell: @kraydom this ^
[3:14:22] ZeusDNA: CTRL F search for ksm
[3:14:23] pavepawns: A: No. Under the Valor upgrade system, your Mythic+ score was used to qualify your character for higher levels of Valor upgrades and a series of achievements (Keystone Explorer/Keystone Conqueror/Keystone Master/Keystone Hero). With this new upgrade system, Mythic+ score won’t be used to qualify for upgrade levels (Crests will be doing that instead), but the score will still be tracked for those achievements. And after a key, if anyone in the group had their score go up, you’ll get bonus Flights
[3:14:25] JayPuppa: CTRL+F
[3:14:27] Defused1976: Rating is only for ksm/ksh raising will not be for upgrading
[3:14:27] faulen: Its in the Q&A "Is Mythic+ score going away"
[3:14:28] itsDets: your m+ rating now only affects achievements and bonus Flightstones
[3:14:31] Yieiw: Think it was in the Q&A at the bottom
[3:14:31] brewgamingtv: no
[3:14:37] brewgamingtv: they said u don't need ksm or ksh
[3:14:42] Calphurnious: @mobbo VoteYea
[3:14:47] SeckSymbols: Not needing rating is wonderful, only reason I pushed to 2.4k+ was for the upgrades
[3:14:57] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @faulen (warning)
[3:15:03] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They are
[3:15:04] KaisenSiru: SeemsGood
[3:15:14] faulen: at the bottom of that post
[3:15:17] pavepawns: the gear post
[3:15:17] Tripnbunz: so we dont need 2400 im lost
[3:15:23] pavepawns: theres a q&a at the bottom
[3:15:24] WaverlyP15: no, seasonal ffix is going away
[3:15:38] Milanesa_De_Pollo: This will be the upgrade system from RIFT
[3:15:42] D1Chile: crest are basicly  primal  and concentrated proimal so u ll still need toi run certain quality
[3:15:48] Whiskey_Corin: @Thdlock Time to bully LFR kids and stealing their loot KEKW
[3:15:50] Defused1976: The gear post. You will have a IO score only for ksm/ksh
[3:16:06] Tripnbunz: ok nice
[3:16:17] pavepawns: yup

[3:16:22] abracka_: honestly we just need to see this in action at this point
[3:16:24] Sayryn: Bring on the carries
[3:16:24] barefax: yay... cya rating
[3:16:33] Teknofear64: I think they need to make dungeons harder and rewards greater so you don't have to run them as often
[3:16:33] Tripnbunz: thats the poinyt
[3:16:35] Talecorexz: what about pvp Sadge

[3:16:41] SeckSymbols: @NBK_Sethus Waah
[3:16:42] Teknofear64: make cc a thing
[3:16:43] WaverlyP15: are we going to be able to upgrade crafted gear still?
[3:16:48] mobbo: If there is a SBG or Court next season you can just run that

[3:16:49] Rhoncer: you kinda get the io for doing those things anyway
[3:16:51] jarilrpg: the good thing, just get the rating on main, dont need it for alts to upgrade, just spam 16s on alts
[3:16:55] Teknofear64: again
[3:16:59] Hizuru1: THta is good change
[3:17:00] Tinit5190: @Towelliee Sounds fine. Your iO will still be needed to get into keys.
[3:17:04] Hizuru1: I can do KEY and GET UPGRADE FROM IT
[3:17:06] SeckSymbols: I was a pure pugger LUL
[3:17:07] Hizuru1: IMAGINE Pog
[3:17:18] fumennen: but can I get a piece of tier form lfr and the upgrade to mythic?
[3:17:25] faulen: yes
[3:17:26] SeckSymbols: YEP
[3:17:27] faulen: much better
[3:17:28] Teknofear64: nothing should come down to "easiest"
[3:17:30] WaverlyP15: 16's arent that hard, but mechanics are key at that point
[3:17:31] Hizuru1: If you bbeat key that is Pog
[3:17:31] JayPuppa: I don't believe Aspect Crests will be dropping in Mythic dungeons - only Mythic raid bosses. Which will limit top level gear to 437 instead of 441 - without stepping into raiding. That's how I understood
[3:17:35] kriiuss: Ive pugged this whole season on a few toons and my main just got 2400. Hasnt be too bad.
[3:17:36] Sayryn: towLets towGo
[3:17:36] Hizuru1: That is great change
[3:17:38] Teknofear64: fun is priority
[3:17:38] TouchMyCream: why are they fixing somthing that wasent broken
[3:17:43] Alienfromger: sounds good makes sense
[3:17:43] doomester: @Towelliee I dont see the probelm
[3:17:44] turfjitsu: not tied to io  lame
[3:17:51] Clicklesly: Well, you'll need +17 now for items, but still ^^
[3:17:52] jberry: I pugged myself all the way to 3k it’s not bad
[3:17:56] SeckSymbols: @TouchMyCream Its not a fix, its an adjustment
[3:18:09] Tyrou: @Just_Jerms they already said it would be dropping from mythic +
[3:18:23] Heero_Effect: I was able to pug 16s pretty successfully. I don’t have much of a desire to go above that
[3:18:35] jayXtream: people still only want to take rio 2700+ players for +20 keys. even with mythic ilvl gear.
[3:18:36] mobbo: Because Blizz keeps making shit go up
[3:18:39] pavepawns: will there be a cap of flightstones though?
[3:18:44] mobbo: We used to only have to run 10a!
[3:18:49] mobbo: 10s!
[3:19:04] aetraxis: finding a hard time getting groups at 2.3k io as a 410 hpally. this new system sounds better for gearing
[3:19:05] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWELFEB149 for just $1.49 per meal at https://strms.net/everyplate_towelliee
[3:19:07] JayPuppa: @tyrou different post? Because that post doesn't elaborate
[3:19:08] WaverlyP15: @Heero_Effect iu was sucessful at that until last week, then i ran iinot the bots
[3:19:28] UnfinishedBiz: theres no incentive for people to push past 20, but they still do it
[3:19:31] TouchMyCream: the transition to wow being super casual is happening right before our eyes
[3:19:32] jayXtream: the mythic glow for the sets (2500 rio)
[3:19:32] Heero_Effect: @waverlyp15 towCry
[3:19:45] szble: probably the numbers
[3:19:50] Tinit5190: @Towelliee Feel like they realized people invite based on iO not gear level mostly now. So not much reason for it.
[3:19:56] Draz3nx: why are they doing this seems like convulted shadowlands  BS again
[3:19:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Since Wrath!
[3:20:00] Molvonos: WoW's always been casual, it's only gotten more casual.
[3:20:02] jberry: @jayxtream Well why would people wanna take someone who has never seen a 20 into their group? If they fail it the no longer have a 20 key
[3:20:03] Heero_Effect: Wow feels more casual than lost ark
[3:20:03] Molvonos: Even since Vanilla.
[3:20:05] src1923: like that is a bad thing
[3:20:06] abracka_: what do you think made wrath so popular and hailed as being "the greatest" lol. it was the casual nature it brought to the game
[3:20:10] Molvonos: But I came from EQ.
[3:20:16] WaverlyP15: @Heero_Effect had 3 dps that werent breaking 40k, i was at 37 aas the warr tank
[3:20:16] Arbszy: WoW has always been casual. it was more casual than EQ and SWG.
[3:20:18] jkitchin75: @TouchMyCream and thats a bad thing
[3:20:19] fishncycling: Well I have seen people with great ilvl and crap IO stand in stuff all day and its painful af
[3:20:19] D1Chile: @Towelliee   the 20 was more for mythioc level gear 421   been too easy toi get
[3:20:24] brewgamingtv: casual make up a big % of the players base lol
[3:20:28] Molvonos: @Arbszy eyyyy
[3:20:31] turfjitsu: whack =(
[3:20:31] byrdeen45: i think mythic plus is so boring
[3:20:34] Mecabeast: It's super alt friendly it seems
[3:20:40] t1mbstone: sometimes casual is the way to go y
[3:20:43] Tyrou: @Just_Jerms 1st paragraph of gnome sized version "Shadowflame Crests and their fragments will also come from a wide range of content, including outdoor gameplay, Mythic+ dungeons, and raids."
[3:20:44] Defused1976: At the end of the day I will always push for KSM. KSH is something I always try for but as someone who only pugs sometimes it don’t happens. So I’ll always push my IO. As for raid sadly i don’t have the time to do 200+ plus’s on bosses so that’s another reason I like this!! I can get mythic raid gear without having to be in mythic raid.
[3:20:45] abracka_: hearing you describe the new system with alts and whatnot made me happy. there's a lot of tier sets i want to collect and this will make it easier with revival catalyst/etc
[3:20:53] Elijahss: yes
[3:20:53] Moobot:  The website has gotten a...hellish..makeoever https://www.towelliee.com/ to keep updated on everything that's going on with the WoW:DF Marathons. Backgrounds, goals and giveaways, talents and UI we have it all!
[3:21:02] fishncycling: @Mecabeast kind ... i wouldnt wanna grind out valor on more than one character though
[3:21:06] jayXtream: just add more mounts/transmogs/titles for high rio
[3:21:10] pavepawns: wait the new zone wont have a loading screen :O
[3:21:14] pavepawns: thats neat
[3:21:27] abracka_: sink or swim time baby
[3:21:38] Sykum: have fun
[3:21:47] Hebrewish012: the 1% doesn't really matter tbh
[3:21:55] JayPuppa: @tyrou oh yeah, I understand that different then - if you continue reading, it stats the level of Crest will drop from its appropriate content - implying Aspect is top level Crest coming from Mythic raiding. We'll see!
[3:22:01] WaverlyP15: corss faction guilds are a giant game changer as well
[3:22:03] Heero_Effect: Lol true, 1%ers will always do it all
[3:22:09] mobbo: It’s not in PVP
[3:22:10] pavepawns: theres a question regards to pvp
[3:22:13] jberry: @towelliee they wanted a mythic week only for tuning. The last 2 raids have been unproggable due to a boss that’s just can’t die
[3:22:13] Bulgogiprince: This system just promotes people to play
[3:22:14] RedXIII: I think with all these changes you'll see a growth in the heroic raid community
[3:22:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: They aren't messing with PvP gearing
[3:22:16] pavepawns: in the Q&A
[3:22:17] Bulgogiprince: which is a good thing all around
[3:22:17] WaverlyP15: thats the biggest change in terms of game play in my opinion
[3:22:18] Hebrewish012: hell yeah make money :D
[3:22:22] RedXIII: because people won't feel daunted by gear anymore.
[3:22:29] JayPuppa: Enchanting is about to be the top profession
[3:22:30] Defused1976: I think it does not work pvp is the way I understood. The pvp community was too upset about it.
[3:22:36] rbgdev: It doesn’t for pvp, says it at the top
[3:22:41] PadidinJones: @Towelliee what about fun detected???
[3:22:49] Hizuru1: PvP is sthe MOST dead it has ever been since Legion
[3:22:52] Thoreya: yah its not for pvp
[3:22:53] gregl__: heres the problem with 1-.1
[3:22:55] gregl__: 10.1
[3:22:56] Hizuru1: 0 Idea how they can say go it is working KEKW
[3:22:58] gregl__: log on alt number 1 hit 2400 upgrade 3 slots to max ilevel log on main upgrade those 3 slots for free
[3:23:01] gregl__: rinse and repeat
[3:23:04] Mattyboh: @Towelliee so wait 20 isnt gonna be a cap for mythic plus sorry just  got here
[3:23:12] aetraxis: sounds like its on purpose because of diablo 4
[3:23:14] WaverlyP15: Cross faction guilds, are a giant change IMO and should help alot with people getting mythic groups and raiding
[3:23:18] Whiskey_Corin: I'm still gonna doompost about it on twitter though
[3:23:19] SeckSymbols: @Hizuru1 Thats a huge cap, solo shuffle was poppin off the entire patch
[3:23:20] Hizuru1: Remove caps from crests
[3:23:23] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 no its not, solo shuffle has highest participation in the past like 7 seasons
[3:23:24] JayPuppa: @mattyboh 30 is the cap currently
[3:23:31] aetraxis: Blizzard wants to retain players, they understand D4 will take em away
[3:23:31] Tyrou: @Just_Jerms yeah basically they are going to be dropping from the content appropriate with that specific ilvl whether it is world quests, mythic + or the 4 levels of raids each one will give crests based on the ilvl the content will drop"
[3:23:34] Heero_Effect: Lol who’s getting upset about that?
[3:23:36] src1923: if you're capping your crests , you're not casual
[3:23:38] barefax: will PvP iLevel in a slot effect the PvE gear upgrade system ?  Main is tricked out in high PvP gear.  Alts win ?
[3:23:39] Mattyboh: sorry i meant for the vault
[3:23:39] faulen: no real cap as you can just log on an alt and get more
[3:23:42] PadidinJones: @Towelliee as a casual I like the sound of all that
[3:23:43] Mattyboh: for max reward
[3:23:44] Needdaann: party in my pants
[3:23:55] WaverlyP15: its mine, im on a horde server as allaince lol
[3:23:55] JD_Rieku: They are going to make so much bank with that
[3:23:59] Fawcheddar: cross faction is really gonna help even out faction ratios
[3:24:00] Hizuru1: @SeckSymbols all brackets execpt solo are dead,and solo  only if you enjoy long queue waits as dps play other game, i only heal solo.
[3:24:03] pavepawns: cross faction is exciting but number 1 for me is always mogs
[3:24:04] JayPuppa: @tyrou good deal then!
[3:24:09] Talecorexz: cross faction guilds means cross faction LFG? @Towelliee
[3:24:15] Alepouditsa: i like it to as a person that is alines in a horde server it is lovely
[3:24:18] Hizuru1: @Thoreya solo is only bracket alive and I doubt any dps  enjoys 50 min queues.
[3:24:24] WaverlyP15: @Talecorexz it should
[3:24:24] racketpunch: Are you going to faction change any of your tanks
[3:24:28] Tripnbunz: towelliee will the dwarf pally return even if its a new one
[3:24:29] zall_63: dam true!
[3:24:30] Sandisy: last thing missing is trade being cross faction. allowing that would enable crafters to pick the faction they want instead of staying in the majority
[3:24:31] Alepouditsa: alliance*
[3:24:36] aetraxis: honestly blizzard needs to let pvp die
[3:24:37] Thoreya: @Hizuru1 particpation says otherwise
[3:24:39] Bulgogiprince: at the end of the day it's just business
[3:24:48] WaverlyP15: dwarf tanks for everyone!
[3:24:52] Scathach73: @Towelliee Sloot had a take I agreed with,pretty much the same as yours. Personally,he has issues but he realizes that for the health of the game over-all,these changes are a net win.
[3:25:00] aetraxis: or give PVP a total complete overhaul
[3:25:06] Fawcheddar: dwarf life
[3:25:06] Hizuru1: @Thoreya ye solo is ONLY bracket ALIVE
[3:25:19] Fawcheddar: Area 52 Dwarves inbound
[3:25:26] raldrik: yeah if the RWF is done in 2 days because they ultra sweaty but the rest of the playerbase has more fun its a major win
[3:25:29] SeckSymbols: @Hizuru1 You're overdramatacizing it, I've NEVER had a 50 minute wait, on average it was 8 minutes as a DPS

[3:43:55] nightwolf_87: @dimofodi thx bud
[3:44:13] dimofodi: Hear me out, mega dungeon and 6 old dungeons OR....OR it'll be 10 dungeons 4 old, 4 DF and mega like they did in SL S3.
[3:44:14] Moobot:  Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || Exclusive Dragonflight 10.1 Interview with WoW Game Directors youtu.be/X6B1skgZrlA
[3:44:35] PvtHudson093: 2 Df from s1 and 2 df from s2
[3:44:41] Zivs: They probably wont do any of the dungeons from S2 in S3
[3:45:15] BE3njo: @Towelliee I was wondering what part u dont like about pala tier set, or u dont like it in general?
[3:45:27] Zivs: I could see that but I also feel like they would want mileage out of the DF dungeons
[3:45:28] coldarmorTBG: So, I'm sure its been explained, But what is this Mega dungeon??
[3:45:41] paulson14: Just give me AA and the rest can be old dungeons.

[3:45:48] Sayryn: What do you think the next expansion is going to be about?
[3:45:49] darkkilla1: but you can air your balls out under robes
[3:45:49] Zivs: its in 10.1.5 so no info @coldarmorTBG
[3:45:51] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee Hear me out. Agree on 6 old dungeons, with mega but with a seasonal affix maybe related to that LAVA from the lab? @Towelliee your thoughts?
[3:45:53] NineOneSixGod: Bro Kilt tanking is totally a thing
[3:45:58] dannyis1337: d4 drops at kfc now live lol
[3:46:05] PvtHudson093: 1 from every expac fromn Cata to Sadowlands and the mega dungeon
[3:46:14] Stoops21: ulduar heroic set is my fav robe
[3:46:18] pigzip: I mean really their plate robes. How do you move in that?
[3:46:23] Dackor: Also annoying as the rest of the tier sets that have robes are open and have more 3D elements, instead of just a tube with floating legplates
[3:46:23] MedicineMan: @SeckSymbols yup! the tier set bonuses are so bad!
[3:46:35] dimofodi: That's thing that kills me, when I played Holy in Firelands, I liked the kilt look but when I went to tanking it just felt awkard.
[3:46:36] Fawcheddar: regular affixes are getting reworked too
[3:46:42] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee yes following the story after we clear the lab, probably things derive from it, to maybe link with story is what I meant :P
[3:46:47] darkkilla1: so excited though.. bursting grevious in breckenhide hallows
[3:46:56] dimofodi: They made transmog for a reason. :D
[3:47:11] Draz3nx: can they just delete grevious please
[3:47:24] Heero_Effect: towOof
[3:47:35] darkkilla1: return of ragnaros because us killing him 2 times is not enough
[3:47:37] PvtHudson093: 1 dungeon from each expac from Cata to Shadowlands and Mega dungeon
[3:47:41] pigzip: @towelliee why do you not have a hammer squad coffee cup?
[3:47:54] dimofodi: I feel like slowly but surely we're going to face off against the old gods one by one and eventually the old gods will have enough of our shit and we'll get and old gods expansion.
[3:48:24] Heero_Effect: Honestly your interview was prefect. Felt like you hit the topics majority of players care about
[3:48:26] PvtHudson093: ewwwww
[3:48:31] temp3st98: mop leveling gear

[3:50:30] turfjitsu: @Eviltuna13 meme? its in game already lol
[3:50:30] darkkilla1: you mean no FFXIV level telegraphs
[3:50:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've said for a long time, if the game really needs addons then they need to be including in the standard UI
[3:51:33] Eviltuna13: @hearthstavern can only do cross faction with people on your friends list not through the LFG finder
[3:51:55] ZeusDNA: Wonder if we'll get a flashback to raz in her humanoid form
[3:51:56] Armdel: wouldn't be surprised if we get to see it in a flashback
[3:51:56] LoseAlotLuke: bro sounds like Megatron
[3:51:56] dimofodi: holy shit, i just went to watch the video and realized i wasnt subbed to the Youtube I'm terrible at life
[3:52:05] NetherRegion: @duffluv22 I agree

[3:55:26] SpoofAvatar: scalamander(?) will get corrupted

[5:01:46] 無職提督: CMON, U GOTTA ASK?
[5:02:00] 無職提督: no one cares about part2
[5:02:13] 91Niki: @下班後提督 That's called a personal opinion
[5:02:15] Jaren475: @Towelliee apparently they found a frozen cadaver with the black plague, so, as expected of scientists, they dug it up, extracted the plague, and studied it.... instead of doing the obvious thing and destroy the potential bio-weapon
[5:02:17] Sollice: I hope Amazon turns out some bangers with Henry Cavill. Hyped for a 40k series
[5:02:17] xxsargexx: i enjoyed part 2
[5:02:23] abracka_: part2 was phenomenal lol
[5:02:24] 91Niki: I also really enjoyed part 2
[5:02:58] Sollice: ? We have stores of the black plague in laboratories right now. We have always had it and it's still a thing
[5:02:59] falldrgn: I feel like there is a long running series of video games with zombies that says that was a bad idea..
[5:03:02] Keglett: goddamn shame what happened with Witcher
[5:03:04] Sollice: Or is this a video game we are talking about
[5:03:08] im_n0t_jezus: wasnt the last plague like 100 or so years ago in some shit country
[5:03:09] c0mmander_starscream: 40K should be good RIP The Witcher series
[5:03:11] 無職提督: sure, like millions of others have the same personal opinion as me
[5:03:14] dwolters_the_zombieman: Last of Us series is well more resources than Netflix did with RE series
[5:03:17] Ponickz: I just started watching it i cant turn it off
[5:03:26] snake_like: bubonic plague is found randomly in the world still. nothing new
