[1:47:42] Crypt135: danS
[1:47:48] ElusiveOne_: danHmm can you take an orc or an ogre? danDerp
[1:47:50] Skipitin: I do not know why foreigners keep on saying we got free health care here because we don't. It's not that expensive though as you have to only pay a part of the cost if the public health care. Then there's the private sector too.
[1:47:51] RightfulSin: @misterclaws that would more so be enslaving.
[1:47:53] NeonFlux: I would like tame the elite gorilla in goru but prob die in progress lol
[1:47:57] emperor_julius_seizure: Lol
[1:47:58] SabreClass: plus they're murlocs monkaS

[1:48:57] SabreClass: Jinyu in MoP were kinda that
[1:48:58] BossaSuperNova: @thorggrim83 We have healthcare. It's not paid for by taxes however.

[1:49:07] Manyfist: Blizz wasted opportunity for Bard class. Tame humanoids like a Hunter, DoT/HoTs like Warlock/Druid, and buffs like Invoker
[1:49:08] Mikazu85: Love these late night streams Dan (It's late night for me here in Sweden) :)
[1:49:09] Skipitin: How about Ogres as playable race?
[1:49:16] NeonFlux: The murlocs was the most prestige pet in classic you could get from a code in booty bay, murky and lurky
[1:49:18] JohnnyBrahms: danDoor
[1:49:26] Koopa_Troopa000: ooo a croc pet? wheres the owl!
[1:49:35] ElusiveOne_: he's trying to learn skills @Koopa_Troopa000

[1:49:44] ElusiveOne_: owlbert getting a well deserved break heh
[1:49:44] Koopa_Troopa000: oh ok athanks @ElusiveOne_
[1:49:58] Thorggrim83: @BossaSuperNova isnt it weird beeing the only country that has it like that?

[1:50:12] emperor_julius_seizure: danSmile
[1:50:15] Ewol66: Yeah a horde guard agrod me there and it flagged me.
[1:50:17] Manyfist: Owlbert needs a rest he’s been flapping his wings non stop
[1:50:35] ElusiveOne_: @Manyfist poor guy never gets to land danSuffer
[1:50:39] Zunahme: @thorggrim83 its a wealth extraction system from sick people.
[1:51:00] RightfulSin: @bossasupernova even though the insurance gets the money from taxes, then get a it from your monthly payment, then still says you need to pay for it.
[1:51:09] Thorggrim83: @Zunahme sick people have wealth? im chroncly ill. And im as broke as they come
[1:51:15] Crypt135: meoW

[1:53:14] jediknight223: Remember when you waited outside the Dark Portal for Burning Crusade to launch Dan?
[1:53:22] NeonFlux: Dark portal would be blue still here as its classic it's not open
[1:53:25] RightfulSin: @thorggrim83 debt slave. You have to give up agency.
[1:53:32] SabreClass: it's blue I think
[1:53:34] NeonFlux: It goes green when tbc opened
[1:53:37] jediknight223: Still looks the same just a green portal instead of read.
[1:53:38] Skipitin: It is strange for me that Ogres aren't playable for Horde. Never played WOW but played Warcrafts back in the day. Any reason why they never got made playable?
[1:53:50] jediknight223: red*
[1:54:08] NeonFlux: Dark portal opening was one most epic moments in wow

[1:54:57] Zunahme: @thorggrim83 i mean that the system in NA is built to make as much profit as possible. It's why the US is the only country with medical bankruptcy
[1:55:02] Thorggrim83: Track giants Kreygasm
[1:55:20] SabreClass: I only remember using that in AQ40
[1:55:29] Lionkingler1: used in gruuls lair to tank some boss as a hunter

[2:00:11] BossaSuperNova: @thorggrim83 Completely understandable. It's just that topics like this tend to snowball and turn negative without anyone trying to do that. Other people need to chime in.
