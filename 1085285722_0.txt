[1:16:37] jamiboiy: I think most avoid steam for FF14 tbh
[1:16:41] Tyrammus84: @Towelliee I use steam for SWTOR cause Bitraider is crap
[1:17:02] BigVideoGameHunter: well when SE won't let you use both the launcher and steam on a single account, the steam numbers won't look super impressive

[1:18:39] PToastman: What’s the min ilvl for the first LFR wing
[1:18:40] lithium364: does china still has the bonus roll system in shadowlands?

[1:18:50] Rottencoarse: @Saphirosa_Dragonaspect limit's start at 9 am central

[1:19:08] Skylin3r: is 7 of 9 there Kappa
[1:19:10] thesacredriches: What do you think is going to be the hardest boss for them?
[1:19:10] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: @AuroryClaire thanks thats the information i was looking for :)
[1:19:12] PotbellyGoat: I feel like this RWF will be a little more exciting than 9.0
[1:19:13] Warjun11: if they kill 9/10 in one day it will be boring
[1:19:14] Kalidin79: @PToastman 195 iirc
[1:19:26] PadidinJones: Whats PI? Pass Interference?

[1:20:49] mrdontw: is there a stream from the chinese guild?
[1:20:53] mwchaos: theyre not afraid to raid 36 straight hours either. remember argus lol
[1:20:55] Dinermoe: so what guilds merged into Team Aster?
[1:20:56] cazhually: BDGG top 5
[1:21:04] Zettabyte: That ABBA song though

[1:21:40] Coaltino: 5 kill-streak care package
[1:21:40] PToastman: I think club penguin is gonna win
[1:21:41] SphinxyOCE: care package basically
[1:21:46] Sollice: lienware sponsored
[1:21:51] Sollice: Alienware*
[1:21:51] CritcobainTV: I think it's a care package reference @Towelliee
[1:21:56] CritcobainTV: Like Call of duty air drops
[1:21:58] MuttonChopins: oh thats cool
[1:22:07] LSBreed: oh man this is gonna be a fun ass race
[1:22:12] NovaSun84: It looks almost South Korean. That's awesome!
[1:22:13] Skylin3r: @Sollice lienware sounds correct Kappa
[1:22:15] PadidinJones: I would not be suprised if they eat Echo/Method and Limit out

[1:22:42] CritcobainTV: @Kisswani Hello
[1:22:49] sunkiz_: how long for mythic raid release?
[1:22:49] LSBreed: I think they meant eek*
[1:22:57] Skylin3r: towHi
[1:23:03] mwchaos: isnt aster people from alpha and skyline and some other guild
[1:23:05] Holysal: that and the videos of strats out too. they will catch up
[1:23:07] thatdoctorcake: if only we had a global release for an actual race
[1:23:11] cazhually: what do you mean 24/7 their characters?
[1:23:11] BigVideoGameHunter: Aster going to use the secret strat of using 20 druids on some bosses
[1:23:13] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee do u think they will get ToS'ed and get banned ?
[1:23:15] Galadeon: So how painful is Mythic Painsmith going to be?
[1:23:16] Zoludar: So are they 24/7 one toon? or are they having multiple people rotated in?
[1:23:25] Exodeo_: Exodeo_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[1:23:28] Sollice: @Rottencoarse ToSed for what
[1:23:28] othraerir: account sharing? oh my
[1:23:30] Dannissh: damn they doing that? playing 2 12 hour groups
[1:23:31] Paulyepsi: When’s the race? Straight after reset?
[1:23:36] Dethilian20: so those guilds disbanded? or sitll in the running?
[1:23:45] Rottencoarse: @Sollice account sharing would be my guess
[1:23:46] mwchaos: alpha was the guild that raided like 30 something hours straight just chain pulling argus and chain smoking in a tiny room. KEKW
[1:23:49] Spunk3n: Pieces and Echo merging in a year or two to counter kekw
[1:23:50] LSBreed: 24hr raiding Inc with rotating raiders.
[1:23:55] CritcobainTV: Imagine Aster just pulls out the 10 ele shaman strat KEKW
[1:24:01] Sollice: They arent account sharing. They have 40 people ready to go on their own characters
[1:24:02] Zoludar: So gear is spread out between 40 people?
[1:24:05] Shayuki: 3 hours until world first race ?
[1:24:08] ArroArroArro: they also have 5 million helpers to gear them up
[1:24:12] lithium364: they do not sleep, they do not eat, never resting, who could stop them
[1:24:12] pixxelina: yup
[1:24:18] ArroArroArro: they do so much together
[1:24:18] Coaltino: towellie do you have the MAIL MUNCHER
[1:24:20] Funderik: this is a new meta in the making for rwf, that 21 man thing is a thing of the past.
[1:24:21] Craster92: you on retail or classic
[1:24:24] LSBreed: Aster is gonna be raiding for 24hrs strait.
[1:24:27] onskapow: got a clip of the chá mount kill?
[1:24:30] onskapow: sha
[1:24:35] CritcobainTV: Aster gonna be raiding in shifts like it's a retail job KEKW
[1:24:35] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee 12 hr shifts then?
[1:24:36] Sollice: !sha
[1:24:41] Dannissh: do they stream on twitch?
[1:24:41] Sollice: The command is gon
[1:24:41] BRUTALIT0PS: BRUTALIT0PS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Howdy
[1:24:43] Sollice: gone
[1:24:50] onskapow: nice
[1:24:52] Wildside1177: lol Chinese people are not super human. They are regular humans like everyone else.
[1:24:53] LSBreed: they probably on like 8-12hr shifts like a job.
[1:24:53] Holysal: watch they win. then we find out they account shared KEKW
[1:24:57] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS brutal i miss you <3
[1:24:59] thatdoctorcake: depends whether Echo/Limit guess the best raid comp for slyvie
[1:25:13] BRUTALIT0PS: I miss you too bb! I just finished midterms, so I have been busy
[1:25:14] LiftyXD: when does the race start?
[1:25:22] stjon13: I wish they'd just let NA, EU, Asia start same day
[1:25:27] maalow: You can't synergize enough in that much time to aim world first
[1:25:35] AuroryClaire: it'll only be effective while they form their main comp though, gear will be too important for last boss
[1:25:35] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS Aye! Good shit bro. Hope you did well my man. I hope nite and the kids are doing well?
[1:25:44] LSBreed: @liftyxd little less than 3 hrs.
[1:25:48] TheGaoSora: Great, more meta...
[1:25:49] PToastman: My question is why haven’t any of the NA or eu wf guilds thought of this already?
[1:25:50] CritcobainTV: I would name the kids but u have like 10 and i dont remember all the names @BRUTALIT0PS KEKW
[1:25:55] cazhually: that would be insanely awesome to see them do this
[1:25:58] Funderik: this is a new meta in the making for sure, limit will jump on the idea with complexity behind them
[1:26:00] scartotem: That meta would be so bad for RWF lol
[1:26:01] w00dst0ckOo: porblem about dameday start is timezones
[1:26:05] Dannissh: skill and time over gear imo
[1:26:06] w00dst0ckOo: *same day
[1:26:09] AuroryClaire: yeah for sure, probably the most exciting race with them going all out :D
[1:26:12] LSBreed: Need a RWF timer imo.
[1:26:22] ssanakk: When are they going to start?
[1:26:26] BRUTALIT0PS: @BRUTALIT0PS Kids are doing well, waiting on my midterms to be graded. Gavin is supposed to have an overnight sleep study tonight, but we'll know for sure around 2 our time.
[1:26:32] cazhually: they're just going in shifts
[1:26:32] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[1:26:35] Cloudemon: they are gonna raid 24 hours thats why
[1:26:35] maalow: They're good at execution, but they struggle when you have to lead the race
[1:26:36] BRUTALIT0PS: I don't have 10 kids Crit, I have 5!
[1:26:37] Cloudemon: so in shifts
[1:26:38] mrniceguy817: Wouldn’t their “meta” be against American wow TOS?
[1:26:41] LSBreed: they are gonna be going 24hrs a day to catch up.
[1:26:42] Sollice: EHHHHHH I dunno about gear. With the amount of loot dropping in raids now. If Limit went straight through and killed every boss without having to stop and split for more gear they arent going to be that much more geared from the first boss to the last
[1:26:45] Funderik: china vs the world
[1:26:47] Dannissh: dont they have higher ilvl then us? or was in a past xpac
[1:26:54] lithium364: maybe they found an bug which allows them to raid with 40 at the same time KeKw
[1:26:59] othraerir: i guess they figured they can catch up if there's minimal downtime
[1:27:00] thatdoctorcake: enigmaHmm
[1:27:05] antori_92: antori1992 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 81 months! 
[1:27:21] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS Same thing lol. Glad everythings going alright for ya's
[1:27:29] AuroryClaire: @Sollice its more about who gets the mythic gear, you dont want mythic loot going to characters that arent being used for the last boss
[1:27:30] TheGaoSora: Can't wait for the Boosting and Gold selling Ads mid Chinese guilds attempts LUL
[1:27:39] LSBreed: @mrniceguy817 they are apparently doing it like everyone else. they want to be a part of the race.
[1:27:46] sigilla_: If they do manage to be competitive with this 40 man approach I have a hard time imagining NA or EU being able to pull off something similar
[1:27:46] WeaponII: WeaponII subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 79 months! LETS GO RWF DAY WOOOOO
[1:27:55] scartotem: Painsmith
[1:27:57] Vaellder: Painsmith for sure
[1:27:58] thatdoctorcake: domination gems will be big
[1:28:06] vernare1982: reset is in 2,5 hrs or?
[1:28:10] Funderik: pain or guardian
[1:28:10] jamiboiy: Painsmith's Ball Wall
[1:28:14] luckfore: yuge wall KKona
[1:28:16] Sollice: I wonder if they will slot in hunters now with their DPS being buffed
[1:28:21] scartotem: build the wall, amirite
[1:28:23] LSBreed: @stormysteph_ Limit and Method have $$
[1:28:30] Zafler: havent mythic been unlocked for NA yet ?
[1:28:53] CritcobainTV: @Zafler after reset
[1:28:57] LSBreed: @zafler ~3hrs
[1:29:01] Sollice: Reset 11 or 10 EST?
[1:29:02] Zafler: Okey Thanks guys!
[1:29:07] Sollice: ok 11 EST
[1:29:08] skFriberg: I'm sure this has been asked a billion times but when are the servers expected to be up for the US?
[1:29:12] skFriberg: 11 EST, got it
[1:29:19] BRUTALIT0PS: @Critcobain Yeah. Things are going well. How are things with y'all?
[1:29:23] skFriberg: So two and a half hours!
[1:29:28] CritcobainTV: Once you get the mechanics of painsmith down, it's not that bad of a fight. I haven't done it on heroic, so i know it needs more dps / healing, but mechanically things dont change a ton apart from the traps to pop
[1:29:33] iLanky: is the alliance horde split the worst we've seen on progress ever do you think?
[1:29:36] Funderik: 2.3 hours.
[1:29:42] Sollice: 15% increase
[1:29:46] Funderik: 2.5*
[1:29:47] ItsGlime: YEAR OF THE SPEAR
[1:30:00] mwchaos: wouldnt it be 12 est, 9 pst is when its supposed to be over
[1:30:00] lithium364: The Tier of the Spear in the Year of the Spear
[1:30:00] duffluv22: Threads of Fate or regular leveling? Which do you prefer?
[1:30:01] idenkaz_: SV is pumpimg atm
[1:30:01] Sollice: MM will be slotted in
[1:30:05] Shayuki: Limit max said that there's a huge increase in difficulty for Painsmith but the rest of the bosses after should be mostly linear(apart from Sylvanas)
[1:30:10] Dinermoe: nope
[1:30:12] t0pgun_: no they can't
[1:30:12] PToastman: Survival is fun I’d like to see that
[1:30:13] Pootiepump: survival and feral druid for the chinese guild
[1:30:14] Eizenhart: Eizenhart subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months!

[1:30:18] banshay3: just respec
[1:30:18] PadidinJones: I would love to see Survival.
[1:30:19] LSBreed: China class stacks survival, becomes the new meta.

[1:30:49] PToastman: Clap

[1:30:53] LSBreed: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:30:56] dennisbooker: gg
[1:30:59] Shayuki: I wonder why they do that instead of having every boss being more difficult than the last, there has to be a reason
[1:30:59] CritcobainTV: EZ Clap
[1:31:03] insaneinthebrain3: LUL
[1:31:06] Sollice: @Towelliee What channel will Lula be on?
[1:31:08] skFriberg: What end boss required the most attempts ever?

[1:31:14] NewWorldReign: GJ @antori1992
[1:31:15] Shamwise: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:31:21] BRUTALIT0PS: @BRUTALIT0PS I must have missed some, so I am assuming they've been late night?
[1:31:22] AuroryClaire: He more meant that painsmith is a big increase in difficulty, then the bosses following are all slightly mroe harder than the last, not easier than painsmith
[1:31:22] CritcobainTV: Druid Blood dk KAppa
[1:31:23] kami5671: 200? U crazy
[1:31:24] Dinermoe: @skFriberg probably Uunat
[1:31:31] Vaellder: It's BDK/Pally and they have a bear prepped
[1:31:34] skFriberg: I expect druid, absolute trucks of a tank
[1:31:41] TheLoho: v excited to see Trill on his WW
[1:31:42] Shayuki: @AuroryClaire Yep, slight linear increase in difficulty
[1:31:44] mwchaos: i saw naowh was really putting a lot of work into his pally have a feeling thatll be seen from limit too
[1:31:45] iSheyn_: skFriberg i think kaelk thas back in bc?
[1:31:47] TheLoho: man makes the class look so easy
[1:31:49] Vaellder: Dead serious
[1:31:50] Sollice: I saw Trill playing DH on their first Heroic clear I was hoping he would play DH :P
[1:31:52] JStevenson: I feel DK and Paladin/Warrior is there
[1:31:53] bagrain: prot warriors good now?
[1:31:55] CritcobainTV: @BRUTALIT0PS Same time as usual, 8 EST 5 pst roughly. but it's not a big deal. I gotta get a webcam so y'all can watch me rage at nerds
[1:31:57] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[1:32:00] raptorstrick: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:32:02] Vaellder: Check their M+ roster, they have a pally prepped
[1:32:06] Shayuki: And then another big increase for Sylvanas I imagine although he didn't really go into specifics for her
[1:32:09] Vaellder: They have 2 holy pallies too
[1:32:09] maalow: Naowh was playing it a lot
[1:32:13] Shayuki: Then again Mythic Sylvanas probably is mostly unknown
[1:32:13] LSBreed: Sloot is saying he's maining paladin dk
[1:32:14] RocketMan23: im sure they have 1 to 2 holy pallys
[1:32:14] Holysal: @bagrain they have rally and warrior dps isnt that great
[1:32:24] Ariea_Whisper: Sloot said he’s playing pally dk so maybe @towelliee
[1:32:50] laceratedsky: laceratedsky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[1:32:51] mwchaos: tbh though this is the most balanced and good tanks have been in forever
[1:32:56] Dannissh: what guild is slootbag in now a days?

[1:34:46] BRUTALIT0PS: I gotchu bb
[1:34:51] Shayuki: But I'm betting that Sylvanas will be bugged on release, she was such a mess on heroic. Hopefully not another N'zoth
[1:35:00] rolando415: yea this is going to be fun
[1:35:04] xp_is_overrated: are us servers up and patched ?
[1:35:12] Sollice: They pushed out a lot of Hotfixes to her
[1:35:12] raldrik: do you think they will jump right into the raid or will they do weeklies and get to max power first
[1:35:20] LSBreed: raid
[1:35:24] jamiboiy: you just have to live with the PTSD afterwards
[1:35:31] Holysal: @xp_is_overrated not yet
[1:35:44] Dannissh: how long does it take ur guild
[1:35:47] Coaltino: aha! so he does play FFXIV
[1:35:48] Cadstars: The thing is they have to keep raiding to pay the Debt for the BOEs LOL
[1:35:51] rolando415: I need to finish Jedi Fallen Order
[1:35:59] LSBreed: @raldrik they always go at every boss right away till they think a boss is unkillable @ their current gear.
[1:36:06] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee you think they're gonna open the chest before getting mythic bosses down and seeing what drops?
[1:36:09] Sollice: @Towelliee Those guilds cant really do that though can they? Dont they have to do runs for all of the BoE or split dales etc
[1:36:10] Shayuki: @greeeeeeb He's been playing FFXIV since the beginning, towelliee's not one of those players who've just started recently
[1:36:10] iLanky: thats what makes me laugh with Lightee... gets WF then goes and wins POE races for a laugh

[1:36:31] mwchaos: 236 m15
[1:36:33] t_train_va: I did WF in FFXIV. It's fun, but can be very taxing. Much more casual now, but still clearing content. I've been put out to pasture in my old age
[1:36:33] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help

[1:36:45] othraerir: 236 sounds about right, i got a 229 from a 12
[1:36:50] CritcobainTV: You think they're gonna open the vault before they do some of the mythic bosses to see what drops? @Towelliee
[1:36:50] t_train_va: And by did, I mean I did racing, not that I got it
[1:36:57] jamiboiy: and I think 246 is what valor can go up to chat? obv not yet

[1:38:16] rolando415: yea
[1:38:18] Shayuki: It makes sense to delay opening Vault until getting to Painsmith
[1:38:27] Shayuki: Or not opening but, choosing your piece
[1:38:31] Wulfgrym: @Critcobain i haven't been playing wow much been working on stream stuff and I am also looking at some 3d printing stuff right now trying to figure out where to put my focus

[1:42:52] Wulfgrym: @Critcobain i might, i just don't want to start streaming again only to have to stop. There is a lot involved in the 3d printing. I put together an actual business plan for my 3d printing plan to see how it all works and so on.

[1:45:52] idenkaz_: wonder how much they will drag out this event
[1:45:52] Bayne77: all you need is one character to unlock flying and your alts 50+ have flying in SL
[1:46:02] Shayuki: But there are massive differences between bonus objectives, some giving next to no progress while others are extremely quick. Interwebs have good guides

[2:43:53] Sollice: I think Blizzard should see how well Diablo Immortal does before doing more mobile games. That being said I expect DI to be really successful

[2:44:50] Holysal: well CoD mobile made 1 billion in the first year. Immortal will do great
[2:44:51] MrGattz: @Deadly26 im very positive that once blizzard bought candy crush all those years back is when they actually started to make a wow/warcraft mobile game.
[2:44:54] chickdrummer88: @sollice I wouldn't be surprised, though
[2:44:56] kilowx: I dont hate ff14, but you cannot watch another mmo without hearing about it, the spike in popularity is insane, did they even do anything?
[2:45:04] sorrow301: a wow streamer saying FFXIV is good? You cant say that its illegal :p
[2:45:06] Broomba: Adult drinks
[2:45:11] xelarman: Diablo 3.5
[2:45:15] Crowzcut: im going play eso never played it

[2:45:20] Boccardo316: Immortal is going to be very popular
[2:45:21] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee you're too far away from all the collectibles. no one can see the stuff like what it is

[2:46:14] Sollice: FF14 has an insaine amount of content
[2:46:16] chickdrummer88: It's crazy that Summit and Shroud hopped onto SWTOR
[2:46:17] MrGattz: @Potbelly_Goat i saw that! kinda looking forward to see how that goes. hopefully its not a buggy ass mess lol
[2:46:18] BigBiffyB: It has more content than WoW it just isn't raiding/dungeons.
[2:46:21] VidulaSaix: @kilowx You could say the same thing about WoW for the last 15 years too
[2:46:23] FranciscoTheMage: i like watching quinn.. but never asmongold. yech
[2:46:25] Thoreya: i think FF is in a honeymoon phase with streamers. they have like 10 years of content to do as opposed to wow when theyve played wow since it first came out
[2:46:29] mixieg: what is msq?
[2:46:30] MrGattz: @Holysal oh for sure its not for everyone
[2:46:34] Shongoshi: the gathering proffesions are so much fun to level in FF14
[2:46:35] Sollice: Main Story Quest

[2:47:30] KapWaller: any updates on the t-shirt bossman?
[2:47:31] xHukk: FF doens't seem to have a competitive aspect. NO dmg meters that I can tell. NO PvP that I've seen. Its very casual and is based around having fun and doing whats enjoybale.
[2:47:37] Sollice: 9 bosses killed in Taz and I only got boots. Feels bad
[2:47:39] mmrghost7: where is max and his boys ?

[2:48:12] Spaede: your old viewers are still Alliance
[2:48:12] Sollice: FF does have instanced PVP, its just not so popular I dont think
[2:48:12] xHukk: I literally said that I know of. lol I've never played FF, just speaking from what I've seen on twitch.
[2:48:20] Athinzi: I do that too.
[2:48:22] chubbyz77: im watching and quit WoW like 4 years ago

[2:48:52] Getitonthelow: I'm at work, eating a breakfast taco
[2:48:57] ContraRob: savage is like heroic, ultimate is like mythic, right?
[2:48:57] lithium364: doesnt really feel like alot of people came back with 9.1, my lfg tool is just filled with boost sellers, and high end keys and almost no 2-9 keys
[2:48:59] VidulaSaix: 1 or 2 days for really good groups to be fair. For the average player it can take weeks
[2:49:04] silverplay1304: I dont play wow ,but I have been watching wow streams since forever
[2:49:05] CritcobainTV: @Getitonthelow Gimmie
[2:49:08] ToadyMcToadFace: Yeah that was like 2 mins of que

[2:49:23] CardinalTX: FF dungeons arent hard but they are fun
[2:49:24] Sollice: @lithium364 I literally saw 15 listing for boost sales on Saturday. Was nuts
[2:49:26] Blynx: Savage isnt that hard if you actually learn the fights they are super scripted
[2:49:26] DarkenedHour97: @Towelliee idk how yall are liking FF14 and not eso, ff14 just seems like a worse game tbh
[2:49:30] CritcobainTV: yeah, I watch wow but I don't play it.
[2:49:32] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[2:49:39] PROLIF3: Eso is really bad
[2:49:40] chubbyz77: there is a part that wants to come back, but i dont want to devote alot of time into it
[2:49:46] belfastcl: @DarkenedHour97 it's easier for wow players to transition to tab target games
[2:49:50] VidulaSaix: @DarkenedHour97 Why does one have to be bad. Can people not enjoy multiple games?
[2:49:50] gkhava: i've not touched wow since january

[2:50:01] Endin: logging into a game to work is no way to live :/
[2:50:04] Thoreya: wake me up when riots mmo comes out
[2:50:05] jeflump: wait WildStar is trying to make a comeback?
[2:50:07] roshfps: They are all gonna get a short burst of content out of ff14 but in my opinion the end game of FF gets stale fast.
[2:50:16] roshfps: It’s just too easy to be full bis
[2:50:19] chickdrummer88: @furycleave ESO is not a bad game
[2:50:21] VidulaSaix: Cause FF isnt meant to be played 24/7 like wow is
[2:50:24] FranciscoTheMage: nope
[2:50:26] Wiiccked: @gkhava same but i feel the itch wathing now
[2:50:26] VidulaSaix: It's designed to play in bursts
[2:50:32] PROLIF3: Eso is very bad
[2:50:39] DarkenedHour97: @belfastcl true true didnt think about that, i like and play all three just seems like eso is a better game overall tbh
[2:50:40] PROLIF3: Boring as shit dead content
[2:50:47] Stxng_: Is SWTOR pve end game even existent?
[2:50:54] roshfps: Yeah that fits people more nowadays
[2:50:55] Speshulist: you can do some RP e-girl content tho
[2:50:59] lithium364: swtor got huttball, its all i need
[2:51:03] BigBiffyB: Crafting, Golden Saucer, Housing stuff, glamors, wolves den is actually decently fun if not great
[2:51:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: being able to play all classes is pretty sweet though
[2:51:09] belfastcl: @furycleave dead content? it releases content yearly, every quarter
[2:51:10] MrGattz: @furycleave just because you dont like it doesnt mean its shit. maybe you just have bad taste.
[2:51:12] BigBiffyB: Ultimates are BONKERS
[2:51:14] Blynx: Man a Wildstar type game with Devs that can actually churn out content would clean up right now
[2:51:23] chickdrummer88: @lestanger when bugs aren't killing it, sure. SWTOR lost a lot of it's end game raiding guilds unfortunately
[2:51:33] Aquadriel: bro i am capped on anima what do i do with my life now
[2:51:38] miktzo: yea its really nice
[2:51:39] Kentach: i actually have a lot of fun with crafting in ff14, feels more engaging
[2:51:42] Aurora_Warrior: if RWF is still on going this time next week, is the move for the top guilds to re clear, or to lock their ID to carry on with Windrunner? (or Pain smith lol)
[2:51:44] Thoreya: yah thats any game
[2:51:52] belfastcl: there are plenty good mmos out there, even old ones like swtor
[2:51:56] VidulaSaix: I've been playing 14 since Beta 3 and I'm playing Shadowlands right now even with it's problems because I just want an FF break since I have nothing to do
[2:51:57] tacofury2: when does the race start?
[2:51:57] DarkenedHour97: @VidulaSaix they are all good and i do like that them all. Eso i think is just objectively better than FF14
[2:51:59] VidulaSaix: Nothing wrong with that
[2:52:01] captivate7: How's Ony doing without mom home?
[2:52:03] Crowzcut: annie geting the money
[2:52:05] Norbi33: curious how hard going to be for this raid to we see the rf kill of Sylvanas
[2:52:08] Sollice: @serenity_dexter If they havent cleared it continues
[2:52:10] memnon94: I know I'm gonna play the shit out of Lost Ark, cant wait
[2:52:12] Boccardo316: It’s even good for WoW too I think
[2:52:15] mmrghost7: ff14 cost money wow doesnt
[2:52:19] doomester: @Towelliee GW2
[2:52:19] Purplestuff1: go murica and hosers
[2:52:20] Nick_Vs_Games: my only complaint with FF14 is the fact youre forced to do the story of every expansion if you want to do end game content @Towelliee
[2:52:21] xHukk: Or, instead of finding something else to "play". People can go outside... just a thought. :D
[2:52:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: i've been playing tbc for a lot since launch but this friday is skyward sword weekend
[2:52:25] Sollice: @mmrghost7 What
[2:52:29] KryingMoon: I play SWTOR on the weekends to take a break from FFXIV
[2:52:29] TeritoTV: @serenity_dexter they can choose to extend or re-clear - I doubt anyone will extend tho
[2:52:30] Windarius: whern
[2:52:32] Norcore: @mmrghost7 you sure about that
[2:52:33] brimes: i love SWTOR man
[2:52:35] Windarius: when is raid going to start
[2:52:35] chickdrummer88: Yeah, they are really enjoying it. Swtorista hooked up Shroud with some mounts
[2:52:36] National89: @mmrghost7 lol what
[2:52:39] Thoreya: i dont have time to play all these games
[2:52:41] MrGattz: @Sollice as in you can buy wow time with in game gold
[2:52:44] Thoreya: so i just play wow lmao
[2:52:44] PROLIF3: Imagine there being no good games so they play swtor
[2:52:46] MrGattz: and you cant with ffxiv
[2:52:47] Foxhoundn: @mmrghost7 in what world does wow not cost money?
[2:52:49] CardinalTX: swtor is such a good game for chill story game play
[2:52:50] Sollice: Oh
[2:52:51] mmrghost7: yeah , i have not paid bliz for years
[2:52:55] Crowzcut: wow spent about 50bill to keep it going
[2:52:57] Ertra: give it to the lock
[2:52:58] MrGattz: idk why you cant in ffxiv
[2:52:59] Renzay83: no lust in the party monkaS
[2:53:05] MrGattz: they should do a token system
[2:53:12] ToadyMcToadFace: gotta help your group out brother get your dots on everything
[2:53:12] Mr_Cold_Ice_Tea: @Foxhoundn wow tokens
[2:53:20] Foxhoundn: you're paying with your time then
[2:53:27] Foxhoundn: nothing is free, time to realize that lol
[2:53:32] mmrghost7: not rly that much time
[2:53:35] Sollice: I wil say FF has the WORST account shit. Mog stattion website, one time keys, resetting your password. It was super frustrating to sign back up to play it.
[2:53:36] Moose184: No hardmode?
[2:53:38] mmrghost7: when u know what the fk u are doing
[2:53:41] Swimlife: when does RWF start?
[2:53:44] isickme: Pi lines up well with wings
[2:53:53] MrGattz: @Sollice its actually insane how complex it is. i will agree with that.
[2:53:58] Speshulist: @Swimlife when the servers go down and come back up
[2:54:00] Sollice: An the fact that FF doesnt give previous players the free trial content kind of sucks bals. But free weeks help i guess
[2:54:06] Hybridwarhawk: @Sollice Agreed 100%.

[2:54:21] VidulaSaix: @Sollice For sure. I don't know what it is about Japan and it's account systems but they're pretty much universally bad
[2:54:29] Aquadriel: just survive 4Head
[2:54:36] S1appadabass: i hate the boss in this dungeon that splits the room in to quarters and you have to teleport and shit
[2:54:40] I_DoctorSatan_I: I knew in my bones that Soulforge Embers lego for BM Hunter wasnt going to last long. So glad I've kept my 235 Fang's lego. SFE is just garbage. LUL
[2:54:41] Bayne77: maybe thats why they are pulling like that Kappa
[2:54:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah their trial is insane value
[2:54:55] Boccardo316: True
[2:54:57] VidulaSaix: Yoshi P even said they're probably expand the trial to include Stormblood once Endwalker comes out
[2:55:00] mawzmik: Yo finally got my clickbait gfuel its amazing man
[2:55:04] HostileGamers: should be a full game, 15 day trial
[2:55:07] Eekim189: Runescapes free to play is also really good
[2:55:07] Aquadriel: yep, wows trial is sooo outdated, can barely experience anything of the game with it.
[2:55:09] PidiaP: Lula’s morning thing for Limit starts in 10 minutes, yeah?
[2:55:14] Dethilian20: should be 20 on classic and maybe like 40 or so on retail
[2:55:15] Scoodles91: didnt they made it so you can play up to the last expansion?
[2:55:16] Sollice: @Towelliee Yeah but the problem is I bought Endwalker but havent played in 1 year. Because I own Endwalker my account was not eligible for all of the free content and level to 60 stuff
[2:55:21] Ryathael: Before the level change, I would have said "Vanilla" to level 60 for the Trial wo-uld have been good, but thats not an option anymore. =\
[2:55:27] Eekim189: people actually choose to play that over membership for added restictions sometimes
[2:55:30] Sollice: Or Shadowbring not Endwalker sorry
[2:55:44] VidulaSaix: @Sollice Well yeah, once you've bought the game of course you can't access the FREE trial
[2:55:47] Janigiv: :tf:
[2:55:53] VidulaSaix: It's a trial, not free to play
[2:56:01] silvernecktt: what do you think gives a better gameplay experience between DH and Rogue? I mean like getting into party (M+ / Raiding) and PVP
[2:56:02] HostileGamers: i havnt been here in awhile, towellie playing spriest....?
[2:56:05] I_DoctorSatan_I: Had a good week, took my Fury Warrior from zero IO for S2 on Wednesday and now he's 1339 IO :) "feeling accomplished" SeemsGood
[2:56:14] 클라우센: the ffxiv complete edition includes 1 month of gametime?
[2:56:15] Kentach: a long trial gives the game a better chance to get hooked on the game and they probably know that a realm reborn aint that great
[2:56:18] Uberliciousx: That's true except for healing the last boss, that's rough
[2:56:21] Sollice: @Sollice Why. I should be offered the same content that people are getting for free
[2:56:21] Norbi33: thet does 5.9k dmg every sec :D
[2:56:39] theopenbox: @apesudesne yes
[2:56:40] VidulaSaix: Not after you've bought the game
[2:56:51] ninja_pengu1n: mailroom is bugged to shit
[2:56:53] 5gz_5g: mail room was bugged when I did ut
[2:56:54] Llamatude: mailroom is a bitch on hardmode.
[2:56:54] jamiboiy: band boss
[2:56:55] MrGhostlore: Mailroom Boss is bugged AF
[2:56:56] KingSpud91: Yo is that general grevious?
[2:57:00] Kinghorn: LUL
[2:57:02] Moose184: Have you done the dungeon on hardmode yet?
[2:57:03] VidulaSaix: I say again, it's a free trial not free to play until 60. That's a very important distinction
[2:57:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:57:04] Kinghorn: power infusion
[2:57:11] Honvar: hello there!
[2:57:19] TobeyT85: general grevious WutFace
[2:57:19] Llamatude: just have healer go dps and burn down mailroom ignore EVERYTHING
[2:57:21] Honvar: General Kenobi
[2:57:24] dimofodi: Why you so high on damage done in that group??
[2:57:31] Mecabeast: wiped like 8x last night on mail room cause we would get a package no one could pickup
[2:57:33] raldrik: Is that Gen Grievous?
[2:57:36] CritcobainTV: Ded KEKW
[2:57:37] Sollice: @VidulaSaix That makes even LESS sense. I own the game and have purchased all of the expansion and I dont get the same level of offerings as a free player? I dont know if I want to resub let me play trial account to see if I want to
[2:57:38] xXSiebzehnXx: Extra legendary event in Raid today btw
[2:57:47] NVbrutal: LUL
[2:57:48] Llamatude: @Mecabeast just have healer go dps and burn it all down
[2:57:54] Llamatude: @Mecabeast its what we had to do
[2:57:59] I_DoctorSatan_I: 'KENOBIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII" ~ Dath Maul emote spam in SWBF2 LUL
[2:58:11] OG_Fear: I apped to a bunch of Illi guilds cause my guild imploded yesterday so I put in an app at shade 2 @Towelliee
[2:58:15] LawnSpeaker: don't you need a dot timer for DP to make sure it's always up?
[2:58:17] VidulaSaix: @Sollice Because the free player is on a TRIAL. There are a lot of things they do not have access to, things that once you've paid for the game you DO have access to.
[2:58:19] Deathraid82: General Greivous
[2:58:20] sinlesssinner: is ur priest geared for this dung?
[2:58:28] sinlesssinner: thought he still needed some items
[2:58:28] Ertra: @sinlesssinner lol no
[2:58:32] Sollice: I dont have a sub/ I cant do anything
[2:58:39] kobangames: damn,
[2:58:41] CritcobainTV: DP is the best category on the hub EZ Clap
[2:58:41] othraerir: devouring
[2:58:42] crich85: I tanked the whole thing last night blind and boy was that a loooong dungeon
[2:58:42] LawnSpeaker: devouring plague
[2:58:43] VidulaSaix: Then make a new account and play the free trial and see
[2:58:44] Epidoral: I know only one this that is DP
[2:58:44] Janigiv: @sinlesssinner hes priest is 182ilvl
[2:58:46] Gramkow: when do WF start ?
[2:58:48] ninja_pengu1n: this mega dungeon is so good
[2:58:48] kelimkar: is this after reset ,
[2:58:49] kelimkar: ?
[2:58:50] kochiee: kochiee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:58:50] LawnSpeaker: Oh, couldn't see it
[2:58:51] NVbrutal: the portal boss is prolly the worst imo gonna be interesting in M+ thats for sure
[2:58:57] Speshulist: if I was horde I'd be there :)
[2:59:06] sinlesssinner: haha ok @Janigiv 182 damn lol
[2:59:07] CritcobainTV: i have my 209 dh KAppa
[2:59:08] VidulaSaix: If you made the decision to purchase the game, it's not on them that you can't decide if you want to play without paying
[2:59:10] CritcobainTV: Kappa
[2:59:12] sinlesssinner: tahts low af
[2:59:20] crich85: I was 212 bear and did the whole thing last night
[2:59:43] Nevindaz: BOP BOP BOP
[2:59:51] Ertra: yeah but that's a bear @crich85 bears are leet
[2:59:59] gundamzeros01: agree
[2:59:59] HostileGamers: free up until new expansion
[3:00:00] billybaggens: bear is a different kind of tank
[3:00:01] HostileGamers: for sure
[3:00:02] flebbooo: oh yeah for sure
[3:00:03] crich85: XD @ertra truu
[3:00:03] MrKhanes: agree
[3:00:04] SphinxyOCE: yea 100%
[3:00:05] othraerir: makes sense
[3:00:07] imascootypie: i did hardmode with disguised toast and scarra and toast was 206 bear and had 0 issue
[3:00:10] OJWestTV: wow should be a free game minus new content
[3:00:11] silverplay1304: If u buy the game why sub ?
[3:00:21] Marmoh: I wish the hardmode mount was as unique as the mechagon hardmode mount
[3:00:22] Boccardo316: If they did that, it will be popular af again
[3:00:38] Shiekrunner: OJWestTv sub is fine in my opinion
[3:00:48] HostileGamers: the problem with doing free up until 50, is that they have to continue to update the old content for people who refuse to pay and stay at last expansion
[3:00:53] Sollice: I Idont thin they know to move cell away
[3:01:08] HostileGamers: and wow doesnt like to update old content
[3:01:09] NVbrutal: wow will die if it goes f2p lol they will pack the store with mtx if that ever happens
[3:01:16] Honvar: Waiting for Obi-wan to show up at the end of the fight :)
[3:01:22] borgking82: this hard mode ?
[3:01:24] HigameR4771: LuvSign TwitchUnity <3
[3:01:28] Sollice: Not hard ode
[3:01:29] OJWestTV: @Shiekrunner I agree too i'm literally paying a sub for wow tbc
[3:01:29] spiritXC: wanted to try shadow too, but feels so bad open world, thorgast etc compared to my dk
[3:01:49] captivate7: lol
[3:01:50] OJWestTV: retail just isnt thrilling enough rn
[3:01:52] Shiekrunner: kk :D then i misunderstood

[3:02:55] KravenStormGaming: Is this an ALL DPS run?
[3:03:08] OJWestTV: now i just watch wow streamers and lore videos
[3:03:22] killawatts75: @I_DoctorSatan_I the list is so wrong tho lol it says BiS lego for rogue is MA and its 100% not even close
[3:03:32] Renzay83: think they meant the instruments
[3:03:42] Deathraid82: can't disperse that pucker you just experienced @Towelliee LOL!
[3:03:44] teranda87: bugged postroom
[3:03:53] glory_toon: took us 4 hours to do hard mode on 230+ ilv due too all the bugs in there
[3:04:01] OJWestTV: i needa grind gold to get this flying mount in wow tbc -_- need it to finish kara attune
[3:04:05] TeritoTV: @OJWestTV hah, I think so many people believe wow has gotten worse, and dont realize we just all grew up and priorities and life changed on us - I don't miss classic, I miss when my job was being in high school XD
[3:04:37] I_DoctorSatan_I: @MattDoesThingss no, they removed MA from the list, its updated further down the page for melee
[3:05:09] OJWestTV: @TeritoTV truss me!! that and i miss the lore being more grounded in the darkspear rebellion and stuff.

[3:05:35] CritcobainTV: we got stuck at the post office dude. our group wasn't able to pick up any bombs
[3:05:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @MattDoesThingss MA is 3rd for "BiS" as last alternative, where the other legos are better
[3:05:37] CritcobainTV: so we just left
[3:05:42] DeeKeeezy: did they fix the bomb boss?
[3:05:49] buddlust: @Towelliee thoughts on the reflect trinket from tazavesh? the first technique or whatever its called? any good?
[3:05:51] K_Tower: Nope
[3:05:51] fcombs: can you upgrade gear from Travesh with valor?
[3:05:55] Groltank: Mail room was the only place where there were any bugs
[3:05:56] Recording_on_the_grass: impossble to do this dungeon in a pug
[3:05:58] Colt_Engineer: post office
[3:05:59] im_finger: you can just dps zerg the mail room
[3:06:00] Mecabeast: @critcobain same thing happened to my group last night
[3:06:08] im_finger: its actually easier than doing the mechanics even if they worked
[3:06:13] Speshulist: @Critcobain same with us. couldn't pick up bombs
[3:06:15] Pritamin: if you cannot pick up the vbriefcases, you relog and you can again for 1 try
[3:06:41] Demosking: how my group did it for some diffucilt bosses is that our healer just went dps and we burned it down
[3:07:03] dream_boxing: Morning Towelliee and Chat! Got my shirt today, super excited to try it on later
[3:07:07] ToadyMcToadFace: no

[3:07:19] PandeyWOW: yes
[3:07:22] Groltank: macgical weapons
[3:07:26] Pikinnamez: There's a Weakaura for it.
[3:07:31] chickdrummer88: I don't know why they never fixed Post Office boss when it was that bugged on the PTR
[3:07:38] etter00: Yep got my hoodie in. looks sweet
[3:07:59] Kinghorn: if they have not fixed the post office bug on live yet means they are having trouble with it LUL
[3:08:09] ToadyMcToadFace: that was the last one lol
[3:08:11] ToadyMcToadFace: youre on instribments
[3:08:17] Groltank: you already did the sword

[3:08:53] I_DoctorSatan_I: LUL I KNEW IT!!! Signet of Tormented King's for Fury Warrior is "STILL" BiS for M+. Everyone was saying EM was going to replace it...nope. Signet is very good for AoE in M+, bursting ~10k DPS w/ AoE cap. EZ clap.

[3:10:56] Groltank: PREDICTION! "server Maintenance has been extended till 4pm PDT. We are investigating our log in servers. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused."
[3:10:59] Tcrane_: Cool
[3:11:01] DarkenedHour97: @Towelliee is your guild going to do mythic today?
[3:11:01] Heekss: wait what? does NA and EU start race at the same time?
[3:11:05] I_DoctorSatan_I: @motorboatingpro Iron Chef Japan is my fav. Iron Chef Morimoto is my fav Chef
[3:11:23] killawatts75: theres so much dialogue in this dung that when its a m+ dung its going to be awful
[3:11:27] falldrgn: @Heekss No they start on their respective reset days. But US is today
[3:11:34] TommyVercetii: whats the timing on the release again?
[3:12:20] Valorye11: @Towelliee as a returning playing, what is the biggest advice you can give for shadowlands?
[3:12:21] marquisdb: can you please say where to watch it? :D
[3:12:35] killawatts75: Limits stream @marquisdb
[3:12:51] Groltank: BDG is also streaming

[3:13:44] TommyVercetii: @oraclehuntar only need 1 lol and they won the last 2
[3:13:45] Groltank: there are others but those 3 are the best
[3:13:46] Relic7: @oraclehuntar that are in the running, yes. Realistically only Limit has a chance of those three.
[3:14:01] falldrgn: You think limit goes 9/10 today?
[3:14:06] Relic7: No way
[3:14:06] Groltank: just like eu has Echo, Method and pieces

[3:14:30] NukFur: wait are servers up or is this just shade on eu?
[3:14:32] I_DoctorSatan_I: 
[3:14:40] Relic7: @falldrgn no way if they do, the raid is massively undertuned, and Blizzard do hot fixes, hot buffs and nerfs depending on how quick Limit is progressing
[3:14:45] jerexify: @nukfur THey haven't gone down yet. 11am EST.
[3:14:48] DehCantao: @nukfur still 1h for maintenance
[3:14:49] NukFur: oo
[3:14:50] Thagrius: yea we killed the final phase on hardmode without a healer
[3:14:52] LaffyTheCraze: limit and echo will meet at 8/10
[3:14:59] Thagrius: dungeon is pretty fun
[3:15:00] GazXIII: Secret Slyvanas phase, fight now lasts 1 hour
[3:15:02] Thagrius: i still like mechagon more
[3:15:04] SpankygTV: I think alot of guilds will get 5/10, painsmith will be a bottleneck
[3:15:07] killawatts75: @LaffyTheCraze they will meet at Painsmith i think
[3:15:07] duffluv22: Clip this!!!! Towelliee is healing!!!!!
[3:15:09] KragnosWoW: just tried gfuel for the first time ever, tried clickbait. its tasty but i wouldnt be like "all caps omg this is amazing hype wooo" id give it a 9/10

[3:22:23] toffeeswirl: you don't need to go that close just throw it from a distance
[3:22:25] DehCantao: @ponczi7 race to world first
[3:22:28] wramel: just hero, use CDs, and blow him up before bombs go off
[3:22:34] Noobicron: default UI wins

[3:22:43] ponczuniek: thank you @dehcantao
[3:22:44] DireSaint: just pull the boss out of the room. easy quick fix.
[3:22:59] Kelsillium: that really limits your time tho

[3:23:17] Broomba: That repair bill
[3:23:18] Kelsillium: you can throw it from about 30 yards away
[3:23:26] StraightErro: @Towelliee you can throw it from like a 1/4th of the room away, it takes too long to walk it the whole distance to the chute
[3:23:38] MasterMagus: MasterMagus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! 
[3:24:02] Masqerader: If you see your bop/sac list of who has their cds you can toss it from like 30 yards or so
[3:24:12] Plaster88: @Towelliee you need to throw it earlier
[3:24:14] chickdrummer88: if you have to reset the boss, it is still bugged.
[3:24:28] ToadyMcToadFace: SPAL TJAT

[3:24:47] nickyrichoyb: What time does the RWF begin today?
[3:24:49] plankdemi: why is none soaking the puddles?
[3:24:54] DarkenedHour97: you soak them to not get blue shit @Towelliee
[3:25:00] Masqerader: You guys need to soak that purple stuff so the floor shit don't happen
[3:25:03] Kelsillium: extra action button
[3:25:09] Aquadriel: extra action button bro
[3:25:15] Sollice: mythic raiders friends

[3:25:28] darkwaves: it throws it like a grenade
[3:25:29] Janigiv: mythic raider btw
[3:25:30] plankdemi: you have to click it and then aim it @Towelliee
[3:25:33] toffeeswirl: because you didn't aim it
[3:25:36] SpankygTV: You cant just press it, you need to AIM it hardcore brother
[3:25:36] Aquadriel: you click where it goes lol
[3:25:40] plankdemi: like you aim an aoe
[3:25:43] GlitchedKrAken: you cast it like you would a sigil
[3:25:43] odsap: You can catch the liquids so they don't spread
[3:25:43] DreamLantern_: this raid seems pretty hard, has the race already started Kappa
[3:25:44] Artofdying_ano: just nuke the boss
[3:25:44] Sollice: You really cant run it from far away you get a 50% movement deubff
[3:25:44] 11000BG: when are us servers up? why is no one doing mythic yet?
[3:25:46] SpankygTV: IT's like a point and click ability like healing rain etc
[3:25:46] duffluv22: mates and tea...lol
[3:25:51] Masqerader: use it like you're putting down a sigil
[3:25:55] jerexify: @Towelliee Because you click the button, then you have to aim it using the target reticle on the ground. It went left last time because your target was over to the left and you clicked too quickly.
[3:26:02] Artofdying_ano: you have like 45 seconds to kill the boss, more than enough time
[3:26:03] John_Parker92: 
[3:26:08] Harpai: Or u just ignore the bombs and pop every CD + Hero on bomb phase and nuke him down.. thats how i have done it when i killed it
[3:26:10] Masqerader: and tell them to soak the damn puddles LOL
[3:26:22] GlitchedKrAken: its the same as casting a sigil
[3:26:26] Mecabeast: it wod timewalking this week for a sod normal piece.
[3:26:39] DarkenedHour97: no, just for the blue ground shot
[3:26:40] Kelsillium: you can soak 2 puddles at once with no extra damage, it prevents the puddles spawning which slow and damage you
[3:26:43] DehCantao: soak to keep room clean
[3:26:43] ncatter: soaking the swirlies makes the purple puddles not show up
[3:26:44] Masqerader: its so you don't have purple shit on the floor
[3:26:45] chickdrummer88: soak puddles, throw packages, win
[3:26:50] odsap: Stand in the circle when he throws the puddles, not after they land, though.
[3:26:50] Sollice: I do lol
[3:26:51] mwchaos: hey tow do you remember a guild named Easy on malganis back in legion? what ever happened to them?
[3:26:53] S1appadabass: I do... Sadge
[3:26:55] Lexxania: no when you stand in the circles, it prevents the blue puddles from happening
[3:26:57] Llamatude: 225 dom sockets...

[3:28:26] chickdrummer88: They need to fix this boss
[3:28:28] Sollice: No..People are throing it on the ground or wrong shute. If you do that it explodes
[3:28:29] DehCantao: I think someone is throwing on the wrong portal?!
[3:28:29] mastashiffu: was doing taht all night to me last night
[3:28:30] KingSpud91: This was bugged for me on hardmode, just decided to 4 dps and 1 tank it and nuke
[3:28:31] plankdemi: they dont have the damage rofl
[3:28:32] BadXo: you should all "relog" before next pull
[3:28:34] Pannekaker: They don't have enough damage KappaPride
[3:28:34] ToadyMcToadFace: dude the check is super low
[3:28:36] ChidaRL: this fight is bugged af, we just lust and burn him

[3:28:54] ToadyMcToadFace: warlock was duing 11k with PI, with lust he'll be 14l
[3:29:03] Pritamin: ye relog all. it usually fixes thing, but for 1 try only :D

[3:29:04] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what is the min ilvl for the lfr
[3:29:05] EthicalHermit: we had our healer go dps spec too, but yeah, 40 ilvls is a bit
[3:29:26] Sollice: While the boss can be bugged...It's not bugs killing them. People are not doing the bomb mechanic right and fan mail does an aoe damage you cant avoid. Your healer has to heal through it
[3:29:28] westelan_: are you in the rwf?
[3:29:54] Sollice: They shouldnt no
[3:29:58] zoovthepally: Good morning towel how ya feelin

[3:46:48] Pannekaker: Where is this streamed?
[3:46:54] Ka5h3d: Guys I'm seeing everywhere that Shadowfire Prism is best on hands but I thought hands were a domination socket

[3:47:53] r0b928: You mean 6 your time? I thought it was 8 central
[3:47:56] Yagr6: @progettazione_inferni i hear u but im not talking in the 20 plus range
[3:48:04] KragnosWoW: i tried final fantasy and got sleep reading so much dialog lmao, i didnt even get to try combat out i had to nap
[3:48:36] KragnosWoW: isnt it super important?>
[3:48:42] Yagr6: @progettazione_inferni the reason i feel its a problem is gear is capped at keystone lvl 15
[3:49:04] NovaSun84: we do be like that KEKW
[3:49:09] CthuL0ops: The ARR story is boring to me but the xpacs get better
[3:49:09] Sollice: Eggs of Azeroth is 9 CENTRAL
[3:49:10] Sollice: https://twitter.com/eggsoverazeroth
[3:49:12] VidulaSaix: I'm personally of the belief that if you totally ignore the story then the game probably isn't for you to begin with
[3:49:13] Sollice: Not 8
[3:49:18] Westlove_: I’m loving the story
[3:49:27] Sollice: right
[3:49:28] Blah206: The vanilla story leading up to HW is a slog imo. I know they cut 30% of it out recently.
[3:49:40] KragnosWoW: i havent read so much since high school, my eyes just got tired, it wasnt that it was boring
[3:49:58] VidulaSaix: There's some for sure but I feel they're a very very extreme outlier
[3:50:10] KravenStormGaming: I wish there was an option to replay the full ARR story pre-cut content
[3:50:12] BTiZZY_: @kragnoswow don’t gotta read it bro just quest like wow
[3:50:12] boop5: I always assumed most ppl don't give a damn about story
[3:50:12] Kisswani: I dont recall Xenosys mentioning the story ever , not even once
[3:50:17] ContraRob: That venture plan addon isn't being updated anymore :(
[3:50:18] Pannekaker: Eggs over Azeroth seems awesome!
[3:50:22] Rudric_Ice: gameplay first story is secondary
[3:50:24] Tequilawyrm: @Towelliee WHat's the addon for mission table?
[3:50:26] Coaltino: to get an early start on the maintenance
[3:50:27] Masqerader: cause they announced 8am pst
[3:50:32] griffdog125: I've been playing and raiding end game since 05 and could care less about the story
[3:50:39] Yagr6: i care about gameplay and how my spec feels
[3:51:14] mavericks312: I just feel the story in 14 isn't as good as the main series games imo

[3:52:58] Kisswani: Stormblood ? didn't really like it tbh

[4:11:27] manmower: they are going to account share

[4:12:43] xXSiebzehnXx: I bet that they have two full raid teams, 2 coaches and they plan on doing a combine of the highest geared and damaging/healing players when they hit a sticking point
[4:12:45] danimoto10: thats crazy
[4:12:49] toocheap2rhyme: sleerer agents

[5:23:46] GamerKillance: Well in other news the FF14 servers blew up due to 9.1 story sucking so bad
[5:24:11] Rudric_Ice: and also FF gained a fuck ton of players bcuz of asmon
[5:24:13] ElDrakenMan: yeah digital editions being sold out blows my mind

[5:24:36] ThatGuyFayde: who the fk is that Towellie never has anyone in coms lol
[5:24:46] spammer_123: Asmon and Richcampel are going full against blizz cuz Rich got fired.. so he wants vengeance..
[5:25:04] Fireman17: I never played WoW but watch WoW stramers
[5:25:05] reeepas: any watch EURO cup 3K people raided a stadium to get it
[5:25:17] ThatGuyFayde: @spammer_123 your literally making that up LUL
[5:25:20] mr3machine: @spammer_123 possible reach there :P
[5:25:36] ElDrakenMan: influencer is a job for a reason
[5:25:39] TheUnknowing: Thats why I feel like the ff14 hype isn't genuine at the moment, I love ff14 but it feels like its just hyped cause of the state of WoW
[5:25:42] headninja1ncharge: Stigma? lmao
[5:25:44] spammer_123: I mean RIch said that he got fired from Blizz he was AWC comentator..
[5:26:11] ThatGuyFayde: @spammer_123 so how did you connect that to asmon playing ff?
[5:26:18] donol: donol subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[5:26:23] crawcook: I believe Asmon and a few others play a role, but definitely bad press about wow and good press about FF14 was the most important part.
[5:26:29] mr3machine: Oh jesus not this 'dont listen to the players' nonsense......
[5:26:44] Bixster: i would say that tey hear to much about what the loud minority is screaming
[5:26:46] mr3machine: Yes please take millions of different opinions from differing players advice
[5:26:54] xhaven: but isnt shadowlands a DIRECT result of blizz listening to the players many changes in this xpac was what players complained aboout
[5:27:05] Triknives: Not having PVP in FF14 makes balance easier.
[5:27:34] spammer_123: Well AllCraft etc.. they just hate man, I am a fan of Asmon, he was speaking in BFA that loot is so easier obtainable, now he is talking that getting geared is far too hard..
[5:27:36] Grizly922: ff does have pvp
[5:27:40] Grizly922: its just kinda dead lol
[5:27:40] donol: Is the Daily Treasure TRYHARD an addon or weakaura
[5:27:41] mr3machine: @xhaven bingo, most changes in SL are from listening. THey still have work to do but its mostly that
[5:27:47] Rakim88: D raided with aussie guild in FF14 ResidentSleeper
[5:27:49] spammer_123: I mean.. he just support Rich they are friends.
[5:28:21] Triknives: @Grizly922 It does not have PVP. It has a "heres a thing" but even the core creator says they don't like pvp.
[5:28:36] Grizly922: bro im playing ff pvp rn lol
[5:28:43] sticksaredrifting: @donol i think its a weak aura i havent seen an addon for it
[5:28:43] Clay2K_: @Towelliee did you do your vault already?
[5:28:46] Grizly922: what are u talking about
[5:28:53] spammer_123: I mean you can't compare WoW with FFIX, there are issues with WoW atm, but there are so many ppl and Age groups you can't make it to be good for everyone..
[5:29:00] Triknives: Mages have a 1 minute sleep. There is no PvP. lol
[5:29:20] Rudric_Ice: TRUE
[5:29:22] cabalish: fuck lore gimme loot
[5:29:36] Grizly922: ff does have player versus player modes are what are talking about rofl
[5:29:44] Jimbobaus: Jesse Cox said it best. Wow is a mmorpg ffxiv is a rpgmmo. Saying that the MSQ Has been massively nerfed. Takes no time anymore.
[5:29:49] spammer_123: For example before I start with work I was able to grind and I didn't had any issues with grinding, but now it's kinda hard for me, but I am okey WoW have always been grindy..
[5:29:53] GamerKillance: Don't forget the relic grind people. That end game keeps people occupied for AWHILE
[5:30:16] Grizly922: i dont think you undertand what pvp mean buddy
[5:30:22] Triknives: @Grizly922 You are being dishonest. It may have a "Mode" but the point is they dont balance around it. Thus balancing the game is easy. As its balanced around PVE strictly.
[5:30:28] sticksaredrifting: @Towelliee how do you get the daily treasure tryhard?
[5:30:28] midomimido: @Grizly922 PvP in FF14 is dead, the only PvP-thing, you can do is the daily BG
[5:30:29] Triknives: Stop being dishonest about what is being talked about.
[5:30:35] Grizly922: yea so it has pvp
[5:30:38] TheUnknowing: It's funny cause it feels like no one complained about the launch times until NA started getting WF
[5:30:39] Triknives: wow

[5:31:14] Triknives: So much Arena in FF14. I am so wrong. Such a meta.
[5:31:24] Grizly922: thats not what im saying
[5:31:29] Triknives: Totally has PvP
[5:31:31] Triknives: Big draw
[5:31:34] Grizly922: im just saying it has pvp thats all ure saying it doesnt
[5:31:39] Triknives: It does not.

[7:12:42] BlueBlurPrime: for vaults I suggest just layer 9 for now until we have more knowledge
[7:13:00] TheUnknowing: headstart didnt matter til NA actually got WF, now its a big deal cause EU isnt winning any more

[7:13:07] duffluv22: o ok

[7:37:28] Sollice: Yea but the fact that Deadpool was in a video with Korg means that Deadpool is now "offically" in the MCU
[7:37:37] Nokterian: And they run away from it as they did at SDCC in 2019 LUL
[7:37:38] Sollice: But they may have already kind of confirmed that before through talks
[7:37:50] Nokterian: Deadpool is indeed in the mcu now
[7:38:15] Vindiciii: More pulls lol
[7:38:22] Sollice: No Fox

[7:53:38] UzarhFPS: @sinlesssinner he means their new one :P
[7:53:42] MainlyHigh: no i think they need a face like max a conternt creator/world first raid lead is a good headline imo
[7:53:48] Hypertitan: i haven't no
[7:53:49] olaufh25: are you enjoying the new raid?
[7:54:48] Faenos: It'd shake things up if Method's rank is higher than Echo's
[7:54:50] sinlesssinner: but i do think no EU team will take WF ever again. Just because now Limit is now pros. There never was a guild like that before. So with the different days of raid releases, they can never lose really.
[7:55:19] EthicalHermit: Does anyone know if LFR drops the Shards of Domination?
[7:55:26] Hypertitan: i'm just excited to see limit running an enhancement shaman...that's all i care about :P

[10:53:20] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee after always watching mythic raids I believe mythic raiders should get rewards that other difficulties shouldn't and anybody who gets mad should chill out, I couldn't even handle this so i stick to lfr. Can't wait for you to get Sylvanas mount after you beat her
