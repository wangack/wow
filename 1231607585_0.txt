[1:23:28] Red_Queen____: @matching_towels there is already a lot on the screen, but this goes on for 5hrs and casters will update you at times if you cant keep an eye on time yourself
[1:23:32] SwaggWaggon: they might +3 this
[1:23:37] picc0: @poorhooligans you can see their points on screen

[1:25:12] Red_Queen____: @warvold26 AWC is contracted for yt, this is a one-off event which is why it is able to be on both
[1:25:13] Omnimorphic: you have to say you're fine but you're not really fine
[1:25:13] „Åô„Åø„Çå„ÅÑ: incarn are in the wrong expansion
[1:25:20] ttiewinwt: @warvold26 youtube paid them a boatload of money, unlucky
[1:25:20] Ryhuwu: how much do you gain by +3ing , you need to play the 28 and 2 chest this to gain something compared to 27 +2
[1:25:23] Roiben_: 3 chest timer is 21:36 or something, they have inf time
[1:25:24] SwaggWaggon: thats an insane time save
[1:25:30] DespiseNeville: GG

[1:25:58] mrjonaszwastaken: 2 chest +28 for sure
[1:26:02] SwaggWaggon: okay so if they +2 the 27 then its about the same
[1:26:02] RobotB0FA: @Ryhuwu it's 25 27 29 30/31 versus 25 28 30/31. One less key they gotta do

[1:30:10] aRealPanda: @Ryhuwu its a kyrian friend that comes down from the sky every 80 spells you cast
[1:30:31] Rakazzor: @matching_towels not really since they dont have the other dungeons high enough
[1:30:33] matching_towels: an NPC that shows up when the pulls finished lol

[1:30:50] Ryhuwu: lol
[1:30:50] BizBichou: sheeesh has two-chested these affixes on a 28 twice this season naguuraNotes
[1:31:02] NashMarco: cuz jpc
[1:31:06] WorgenDeath: @Lukasgate You can, because he spawns after you gain 75 stacks of his buff, you just prevent him from ever spawning by cancelling the stacks before the reach 75
[1:31:13] bromanreignz: RETAIL KEKW
[1:31:14] Ryhuwu: @itsjimz they did not do the enw dungeon yet they are not as far behind as it looks.
[1:31:15] just_ok_viewer: you can pre-cancel your bron
[1:31:17] Dj_man: Bron is mvp
[1:31:25] vitorvr33: jpc wasnt playing for echo before?
[1:31:30] mrmudwaters: @matching_towels the +27 points are easy, so aster haven‚Äôt gotten anything of worth until they beat the +29. But at that point they‚Äôre still just one run ahead of method, and aster will have to make two runs in other dungeons to make up those 2 points
[1:31:31] Omnimorphic: these crabs are too close barbPanic
[1:31:33] yellowcake1: 80
[1:31:44] merikhhhh: what are this bron hating casters??
[1:31:50] ttiewinwt: @Ryhuwu you can't control where he comes down and he knocks back everything around him when he does it so it can be really bad
[1:31:58] Shred_Flanders: echo and golden guardians merged for this competition. Both teams were incomplete
[1:32:01] freakngjustin: monkaS

[1:32:19] Estoladhel: leave bron alone
[1:32:26] Trix_x: Do they need to time it for it to count?
[1:32:32] denarin_: You can control Bron appearing.  Just track/cancel stacks
[1:32:34] ttiewinwt: at this point we should have a !legiondungeon command
[1:32:36] DayzB2B: Any link available from Method Sheeesh players? I dont find any streaming
[1:32:37] Ryhuwu: @McCape7 It is. there are 4 SL and 2 legion dungeosn in the pool this time.
[1:32:38] Rakazzor: @McCape7 yep, old expansion
[1:32:40] picc0: @McCape7 yes. legion timewalking event
[1:32:41] matching_towels: @Rakazzor @MrBlackwell yes good points. Method and Sheesh both seem to be 1-2 runs ahead, but def able to be caught up to
[1:32:44] Kahlandra: how can anybody hate bron

[1:34:03] Kahlandra: @Kahlandra he's just MISUNDERSTOOD, he's trying his best
[1:34:13] maulwurf90: full melee comp vs full mage comp is   similiar in opposite way
[1:34:13] picc0: @kapclo atm not too good
[1:34:14] Rakazzor: @matching_towels since Method 3 chested the 25 and likely is to 2 chest the 28 they are not even really ahead on NW. Of Course  everything can happen and they Aster could catch up but i think the points between them and Method are 2 much
[1:34:18] Alasacy: @Kahlandra you start to hate him when he knocks the mobs out of the spear in spires

[1:35:37] matching_towels: @Rakazzor gotcha. I guess Echo need them both to struggle on high keys for a lot of today, while they push higher. Which is a big ask

[1:41:45] EzzLyfe: Aster might 2 chest the 29 tho
[1:41:50] ttiewinwt: if they 3 chested the 28 they'd have to deplete the 31 anyway

[1:46:11] Omnimorphic: @Rakazzor yeah, they didn't, it was the screen swapping that made me confused
[1:46:13] Digitalcrit: 40 s with bron
[1:46:14] BizBichou: @OMNIMORPHIC what did they change
[1:46:26] Omnimorphic: they didn't, my bad
[1:46:27] BizBichou: ah :D
[1:46:33] just_ok_viewer: they also give 10% max health to the party with their heals
[1:46:46] just_ok_viewer: which prevents 1 shots sometimes
[1:46:49] EzzLyfe: Weird thing is that Aster are faster than Method and they are in a 29, while method are in a 28
[1:46:55] threedoorcoupe: Combined with ruby and int pots, vesper goes brrrrrrr
[1:47:02] Rakazzor: @OMNIMORPHIC i got confused for 2-3 secs over it. but i know what you mean the screen switch also got me 1-2 times over the last days :D
[1:47:19] faedrakai: can anyone tell me why they're running older myhic dungeons?
[1:47:23] Sillae: Prayge
[1:47:41] jegsaw2: why are they doing old dungeons?
[1:47:42] cheekingz: why are there legion dungeons in this?
[1:47:44] ConcernedGaming: oooff if they wipe now they might as well just forfeit
[1:47:52] Red_Queen____: @faedrakai we included some legion timewalking dungeons cause of the event plus fun
[1:48:01] EzzLyfe: @faedrakai blizzard included legion m+ for this timewalking event and everyone is hyped because the legion dungeons are now scaled to match new ones
[1:48:04] nietschy: they added m+ legion timewalking
[1:48:13] faedrakai: ah Ty @The_Red__Queen

[1:48:25] EndrylFox: PVE comp[etetion?
[1:48:42] horrendum: old dgs was harder chat, so is actually the otherway around
[1:48:44] ConcernedGaming: Such a shame its tied to Timewalking tho
[1:48:51] c10starburst: it adds a challenge i actually really like the fact that they added timewalking M+. adds some spice
[1:49:01] cheekingz: I thought this is a tournament for which you prepare. Have they trained with old mythics?
[1:49:03] Emiliability: incarn is finally free from eoa jail \o/
[1:49:10] Meeix: meeixWah
[1:49:10] just_ok_viewer: the two points that echo are behind aster is just NW points ???
[1:49:19] askirasa: they brought back legion because shadowlands was dying
[1:49:23] Dwealing: Probably dced
[1:49:28] matching_towels: or disconnected
[1:49:29] PelPet: Did two teams go out yesterday?
[1:49:31] captnmichael: Dc?
[1:49:32] c10starburst: @cheekingz they are given access to Tourney realms to practice
[1:49:33] christianko_chs: DC
[1:49:34] Razdruid: dced
[1:49:34] ascend_37: dc ?
[1:49:35] EzzLyfe: probably dced ye
[1:49:42] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: the ghouls that accompany goregrind are different on the chinese server? or am i tripping
[1:49:46] grovics: why is it four different teams in different dungeons?
[1:49:47] Arkshol: DC Sadge
[1:49:48] picc0: @PelPet 1 on friday and 1 yesterday
[1:49:53] moomoostrike: wow
[1:49:55] AoD_Epherial: @just_ok_viewer  SOA and Court of Stars
[1:50:02] Lorrdzik: @just_ok_viewer No, they need one of their 27 to be 28 too beside NW
[1:50:12] PelPet: Are Incarnation just late then?
[1:50:12] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[1:50:14] moomoostrike: imaging dc in mdi :D
[1:50:19] EzzLyfe: @gdzie_jest_wojtyla you might be tripping but it wouldnt be strange since censorship in games is different where they play
[1:50:21] Ramoneko: ohhhh boy, i hate to see someone dced
[1:50:28] picc0: aster and their dcs :(
[1:50:29] just_ok_viewer: not according to the leaderboard on the bottom left?
[1:50:44] Omnimorphic: did they dc before?
[1:50:49] Shred_Flanders: just 2 deaths, they had 2 after blightborn already
[1:50:51] c10starburst: @grovics the point of this particular tournament is for them to push a set 5 dungeons as high as they can,. they can do in any order they want. the highest key timed in each dungeon counts to score
[1:50:52] Chavly123: I think Method sheeshs biggest problem is going to be the natural cap of possible keys. Because after they hit the "cap" for NW, the only real key i see them being able to maybe complete is Court 29.
[1:50:56] just_ok_viewer: i am talking about echo versus aster, not method
[1:51:13] atpx486: imagine MDI let chinese play at 4 am
[1:51:16] Arkshol: @Chavly123 what cap?
[1:51:17] c10starburst: 6 dungeons
[1:51:19] Rakazzor: @just_ok_viewer for just the keys yes, but Aster is in front because of the times they got if i got it right
[1:51:19] zorthas_: @moomoostrike yeah imagine
[1:51:27] picc0: @OMNIMORPHIC they had dcs last 2 days as well
[1:51:31] SwaggWaggon: Second bad DC for aster this tourny :(
[1:51:44] just_ok_viewer: @Rakazzor ok thanks, but i guess that will also depend on how NW shakes out
[1:51:45] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: GHOSTS Kreygasm
[1:51:47] WorgenDeath: incarn are in a 23?
[1:51:51] Hawkins_JJ: OK no one look at incarnation's key level monkaS
[1:51:53] PelPet: Oh there they are :D
[1:51:59] EzzLyfe: @Arkshol dungeons get impossibly hard at a certain point. Thats what he meant by "cap"
[1:52:01] grovics: @c10starburst Thanks :)
[1:52:03] Omnimorphic: bad china-us connection
[1:52:05] christianko_chs: why 23?
[1:52:08] Chavly123: @Chavly123 Well not like a specific CAP, but more that it is not reasonable that a 30 HoA will be possbile for example, as the 29 is already basically at the max :)
[1:52:09] tha4thwiseman: they started a 23
[1:52:09] Heffalum: Why do they start at 23?
[1:52:10] Anhak: LUL
[1:52:11] SwaggWaggon: LOL poor incarn
[1:52:12] rwdxr: was a 23
[1:52:12] picc0: @WorgenDeath yeah should start at 35
[1:52:15] WorgenDeath: didn't SL dungeons start at 25?
[1:52:16] itsly0n: @Chavly123 they can do 30 hoa
[1:52:17] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: they went for a 23 accidentaly lol
[1:52:18] just_ok_viewer: @Rakazzor just confused on how the caster could say echo isn't in a race for 2nd or first based on 2 points lol
[1:52:20] ominarous2: lol 23?
[1:52:22] ganzoo98: they used the wrong key
[1:52:22] glairige: they were on a 23
[1:52:22] picc0: 25 not 35
[1:52:25] KleinoQQ: !caster
[1:52:25] Moobot: @KleinoQQ Today's casters are AutomaticJak, Doa, Dratnos, Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, and Xyronic

[1:52:28] captnmichael: TThey had a 23
[1:52:28] irontoe3: SL is 25?
[1:52:28] PelPet: lol
[1:52:32] Feroxita1337: is it new that na and eu players can be in one team?
[1:52:35] Chavly123: @itsly0n You think its possible?

[1:53:03] itsly0n: @Chavly123 they timed it on live so its possible
[1:53:03] mrmudwaters: Ayayayay scoM scoM scoM
[1:53:38] ganzoo98: @Feroxita1337 they always could
[1:53:44] Rakazzor: @just_ok_viewer yeah i also dont get it. its more of a race who is second then if aster can go 1st. Method seems safe if they dont mess it up completely
[1:53:44] Lorrdzik: @tremendes After all its not old Echo team. Its mix teams for this TGP
[1:53:48] Feroxita1337: ah ty
[1:54:01] Fira_Ghain: any benefit to 2-starring dungeons in this? Just a tie-breaker?
[1:54:18] picc0: @Fira_Ghain you safe a lot of time
[1:54:25] jyngwei: @Fira_Ghain ? you get to skip a key level??
[1:54:47] ConcernedGaming: @Fira_Ghain If you 2star a 29 you can go straight to the 31 and not spend 30 minutes doing the 30 inbetween
[1:54:48] WorgenDeath: @Fira_Ghain tie breaker for time and beign able to skip a level and not having to run the levels inbetween
[1:54:51] Rakazzor: @Fira_Ghain if you 2 chest the 28 you can skip 29 key
[1:54:58] Badziee: where is Naguura?
[1:55:08] WorgenDeath: @Fira_Ghain If you +2 a 25 you get to do a 27 without having done 26
[1:55:12] Kahlandra: she's taking a break

[1:56:47] TheSemiDutch: @Snupsiknight nope
[1:56:47] kraiser1624: Highest timed NW is 31, so I think that will be timed, 32 is what looks sketchy, right?
[1:56:51] Chavly123: @itsly0n No 30 HoA has been timed on live as of yet, atleast not by what i can see. Besudes, the highest keys on live have different affixes aswell :)
[1:56:56] c10starburst: nah  they are steraming minecraft
[1:57:02] kraiser1624: Timed on Live I meant

[1:57:16] simplepathjg: ahh yes only nw final day so much fun to watch
[1:57:18] just_ok_viewer: 2 chesting the 29 is so much better than 2 chesting a 28 here
[1:57:20] mrmudwaters: Method 1,5 dungeons ahead of the competition? Sheesh, so strong! scoM scoM scoM
[1:57:25] EzzLyfe: This will always happen tho, teams will push the easiest key last day anyway
[1:57:33] Rakazzor: @kraiser1624 yeah, but i can imagine getting some tries on 32 tonight
[1:57:35] mrmudwaters: Well, one ahead now‚Ä¶

[2:03:51] PugHealer: !casters
[2:03:51] Moobot: @PugHealer Today's casters are AutomaticJak, Doa, Dratnos, Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, and Xyronic
[2:03:56] ominarous2: if the first 2 bosses can't be done on a 32, then mc doesnt really matter
[2:03:59] Xyronic: o/
[2:04:05] pooomper: @Idayn gonna be harder with 0 avoidance
[2:04:18] tyreses69: Is today the last day?
[2:04:19] Sumirina: 32 is tough
[2:04:23] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: oh man what a transition
[2:04:24] Red_Queen____: @tyreses69 yes
[2:04:25] spectrashock: @ominarous2 they've been done on tyrannical 30 on live so it'll be fine
[2:04:26] Xyronic: 32 or bust Madge
[2:04:29] athenabtw: VoteNay
[2:04:29] RobotB0FA: @Xyronic o7
[2:04:31] Sumirina: @tyreses69 yes
[2:04:41] RobotB0FA: we busting then
[2:04:42] wildwittra: like your prediction @Xyronic
[2:04:44] Sumirina: xyronic the believer
[2:04:47] Digitalcrit: Do you officially agree with that? I do
[2:04:49] Dbo_Games: Much deserved for Method Sheeesh to win this as they were the team that most valued the live push system
[2:04:51] Tulula: no way
[2:04:58] Trilltko: i believe in the 32
[2:05:00] BizBichou: @Xyronic sheeesh will do it wildigRoll2
[2:05:03] skilled_fragi: @xyronic stop this pls , my pug grps can't do 15 even BibleThump
[2:05:18] ominarous2: @ominarous2 yeah but 2 key levels is a bit more than tyrannical affix. tyr is only 15% damage and each key level is 10-11% each. and 0 avoidance for the belch, where they have ~10% on live
[2:05:23] Digitalcrit: Lol
[2:05:24] Xyronic: @skilled_fragi probably because you arent using the meta comp with the best strategies üò°
[2:05:27] Estoladhel: bron could do +33 alone
[2:05:38] pepega_in_the_chat4: gingi team win like always using "cleaver use of game mechanic"
[2:05:39] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[2:05:42] BizBichou: i believe in wildi 'tomathan' mage, he will bring sheeesh to 32 naguuraHYPERS
[2:05:58] Rakazzor: @BenMathlock you forgot the Kappa
[2:06:13] Emiliability: @Estoladhel bron COULD if he wanted to, but since he's a jailer servant instead he's just sticking to sabotaging runs
[2:06:13] Jon_83: SMOrc muhahaha
[2:06:22] spectrashock: @ominarous2 less hp than a 30 tyrannical though, avoidance is true though
[2:06:25] Sumirina: when I see all the bron shenanigans, I'm considering macroing a cancelaura in all my abilities...
[2:06:28] ominarous2: can ram or speed play shadow? that would be interesting to see
[2:06:32] Redzone141: His name is Bron Cena
[2:06:48] ominarous2: @ominarous2 hp matters less than damage, because at some point your class just cant survive a belch
[2:06:58] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: @ominarous2 its not a difficult class to play but i havent seen any of them play it
[2:07:11] Blightrose: uh oh
[2:07:37] Vajhera: died on purpose?
[2:07:38] eversmile413: Aster 31 Blightbone 30 secs faster than Method 30's
[2:07:45] Tonnyowns1: what was the website to check geare
[2:08:17] Red_Queen____: !gear

[2:08:17] Kahlandra: !gear
[2:08:17] ttiewinwt: I've had enough of you! üò°
[2:08:19] Sumirina: the talk about two chesting a 30 still sounds crazy to me
[2:08:24] ominarous2: @MeatyAertai that's because aster pulls incinerator in with the first boss and uses a spear, which i dont think method does
[2:08:30] SamsonautEU: !caster
[2:08:30] Moobot: @SamsonautEU Today's casters are AutomaticJak, Doa, Dratnos, Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, and Xyronic
[2:08:31] odawgxd: perpit
[2:08:33] Red_Queen____: just navigate that site and click on the run you want to see
[2:08:36] ominarous2: @Sumirina a 30 nw has been 2 chested on live
[2:08:54] Sumirina: crazy :D
[2:09:13] pepega_in_the_chat4: still waiting for cross faction cross realm raiding ResidentSleeper also flex mythic raid. learn to balance
[2:09:15] Omnimorphic: what if they +2 the 25 on purpose so they could get a 31?
[2:09:32] MoMoFoSh0: How is the resto shaman their top dps? lol
[2:09:42] vaereee: monkaHmm
[2:09:43] BizBichou: @ominarous2 30 NW has not been two chested on live, at least according to RIO
[2:09:49] EzzLyfe: @MoMoFoSh0 vesper totem pog
[2:09:51] kwizzzz: @OMNIMORPHIC i can assure you that is not what is happening
[2:09:59] winnem89: "couple"
[2:10:00] Sathyron: @ominarous2 that is not true. Fastest +30 nw on live is 31:54 by Sheesh. And thats not twochest
[2:10:05] Xyronic: @BizBichou 31 has been timed on live.
[2:10:07] Omnimorphic: LUL
[2:10:19] tomcruise210: we have a race now
[2:10:29] ominarous2: mb thought it had been 2 chested :)
[2:10:31] vaereee: @OMNIMORPHIC honeslty mightve been intentional and 5Head
[2:10:41] pepega_in_the_chat4: wheres Maw of Souls? best dungeon excluded
[2:10:41] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[2:10:42] BizBichou: @Xyronic yeah, i know, was just replying to if 30 has been 2-chested on live naguuraGiggle
[2:10:44] Foolishdevils12: @tomcruise210 Can I get an  autograph?
[2:10:49] Xyronic: o misread!
[2:10:50] sniffuu: can they lower a keystone?
[2:10:51] Rakazzor: @OMNIMORPHIC still losing time on the 25 key since you can play the keys between xD
[2:10:55] textio545: ohohoh 29++
[2:11:04] ominarous2: @Xyronic yeah xyro how dare you ):<
[2:11:06] Muchasz: @sniffuu yea
[2:11:07] Rakazzor: @sniffuu yeah they can
[2:11:11] cheekingz: Who is this Taner dude. Never heard of him before this patch
[2:11:33] ConcernedGaming: 29 DOS is something you do if you finish a dungeon with 10 minutes left in the day
[2:11:37] simplepathjg: healer for method plays a lot of r sham
[2:11:39] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: @cheekingz the guy that used to bully you in highschool
[2:11:42] Omnimorphic: there's only one timed 31 rip
[2:11:51] Lorgokz: that game menu KEKW
[2:11:53] justchill56: @cheekingz #1 healer in the world on raider io
[2:11:54] tomcruise210: @tomcruise210  bttvNice
[2:12:09] tomcruise210: @tomcruise210 no cool emotes Sadge
[2:12:14] pega_pega_confia_322: 31? Pog
[2:12:34] tomcruise210: LUL
[2:13:24] Omnimorphic: I doubt anyone can get a 32, even a 31 I'm doubting
[2:13:26] ttiewinwt: @tomcruise210 haven't you heard? pepe is a hate symbol Kappa
[2:13:35] Rakazzor: Method should just go full ham on the 32 with the points they are in front after they do this 30 :D
[2:13:40] pepega_in_the_chat4: Pepega ?
[2:13:42] ttiewinwt: @OMNIMORPHIC 31 has been done on live
[2:14:04] Flameisthename: Was afk for 1 hour what I miss
[2:14:11] Omnimorphic: I know, doesn't mean they will be able to do it here
[2:14:27] magistrixo: on which realm ia aster.y?
[2:14:36] Redzone141: 31 HW is definitely doable, has been timed on live even. 32 is kinda sketch, you'd need a lot of optimizing, and a little bit of luck to go your way, and you don't have that kinda time in TGP
[2:14:39] driver1: 100% they can
[2:14:44] textio545: @mazze_2104 china
[2:14:49] silverfeel: What dungeon is this?
[2:14:54] pepega_in_the_chat4: give every tank raid buff or remove them all
[2:14:56] Xeyian: @ml0dy_m  Stare
[2:15:04] ominarous2: oh @Xyronic  what happened was they didnt kill the adds in melee and nobody used incap roar or blinding light to temporarily cc them right before they died. I think anuo just tried to press it too late.
[2:15:14] ominarous2: thtas how aster wiped in the 25
[2:15:23] EzzLyfe: Are they using Frost Nova on the last second of the Final Harvest?
[2:15:39] magistrixo: i thought there is also a german guild with this name#
[2:15:45] Omnimorphic: how many tries did it take on live, though?
[2:15:45] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[2:15:50] BizBichou: sheeesh timed 31 with a minute to spare on spiteful/necrotic, i believe in a 32 wildigFeelsStrongMan
[2:15:56] Arisolo: Not sure on weapon usage but aster is a minute ahead of sheesh in a 31 vs 30
[2:16:03] Alasacy: @OMNIMORPHIC 1
[2:16:19] SemtexLPlay: Frost Nova doesnt save you there its the Roar from the Bear Tank
[2:16:21] Healingstat: Aster having a good day so far
[2:16:26] Arisolo: Depends on how much they save for last boss since it‚Äôs like 8 min long or something on 31
[2:16:35] Rakazzor: i also believe in the 32 tonight
[2:16:41] Rogastik: @Arisolo Shadow priest is huge ST dmg over WW, and every AoE pack dies to robot orbs
[2:16:44] BizBichou: @OMNIMORPHIC pretty sure they got the 31 from a 30PF and timed it immediately
[2:16:50] ttiewinwt: üêª om nom
[2:16:57] eversmile413: Aster used one spear, Method didnt but I don't think it's 90 secs difference if used on last boss? or is it a safety thing
[2:16:58] ysillien: 31 amarth split faster than 30
[2:17:11] ominarous2: @Arisolo sheesh makes up a lot of time in the necropolis though because of the windwalker.
[2:17:20] Izkatu: They use Priest for the mc , no for the damage he do lol
[2:17:25] Thaddenn: Can a mod wsp me why i got timed out. i genuinely dont know
[2:17:33] kraiser1624: Can casters explain the difference in comps? :o
[2:17:50] St0rmbr3ak3r: @MeatyAertai Method need to save something for last boss since they dont have a priest to bring the flesh crafter
[2:17:52] mrmudwaters: Gogo scoM 32 scoM
[2:17:55] Rakazzor: @MeatyAertai Method always does this t oget the last boss down faster, but i dont know the reason :D
[2:17:57] Arisolo: We‚Äôll see how it plays out. My gut says aster does 31 and then jumps into 28 COS
[2:18:17] Gomlhunter: Disc Priest PogChamp
[2:18:22] ConcernedGaming: @ItsShomy Yes but its still good
[2:18:24] Rogastik: @Izkatu Thats true but shadow is still way more single target dmg than WW, WW single target is kinda bad compared to rogue and shadow
[2:18:25] Izkatu: @ItsShomy yes
[2:18:25] ominarous2: @kraiser1624 i dont think anybody in method sheesh plays priest on live, and they already timed a 31 with this specific comp on live
[2:18:30] pega_pega_confia_322: nooo
[2:18:38] pepega_in_the_chat4: Parrygodx First of His Name
[2:18:38] DerDurchDieScheibeBoxxerr: ``play safe, big IO``
[2:18:43] gameofthrower: caster curse Sadge
[2:18:47] Arisolo: WW ST is bad- full stop.
[2:19:11] Blightrose: eeek not gppd asterly
[2:19:24] Raitox92: "full team wipe" are they watching or just talking stuff?
[2:19:24] Tuckis: @bobmanzari
[2:19:38] kwizzzz: not going for the 31 2chest Susge
[2:19:56] ConcernedGaming: Aster Y's biggest opponent this tournament is their connections
[2:20:03] atpx486: they want them to wipe obviously
[2:20:07] VyNKaSMyN_: BONK
[2:20:27] Arisolo: Asters strat was much more aggressive early in NW. They did blightborne with the fire emissary
[2:20:46] MakzzTV: aster doing double flesh crafter monkaS
[2:20:46] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[2:20:50] Arisolo: Probably where they speared but I didn‚Äôt see
[2:20:57] sniffsc: double fleshcrafter strat from ASter
[2:21:01] kraiser1624: @kraiser1624 But echo with that disc priest :O XD
[2:21:13] ominarous2: @Arisolo yes i think they speared it
[2:21:15] just_ok_viewer: I think the shadow priest might be really important for NW 32, so I wonder if method sheesh even has one prepped
[2:21:32] ruediruempel: why echo struggling in the tourament?
[2:21:48] Arisolo: So far no one except Thaner has swapped off his main on sheesh
[2:21:53] Valhooli: I wouldnt say they are struggling?
[2:21:57] Tylarr_: she didnt listen kek
[2:22:04] picc0: @ruediruempel cause its a mixed team this time
[2:22:04] JLassie: well, Sheesh have done the highest NW key done so I think they can do it if anyone can regardless of healer pick
[2:22:11] Valhooli: All the teams are very close. Aster and Method are just playing out of their minds
[2:22:15] bronwaterg: deaf as f LuL
[2:22:17] littlesaintnz: probably because theyre a mix of two teams who havent played together much
[2:22:18] wernou: Method sheesh is actually the best ranked on rio at the moment
[2:22:18] kraiser1624: ye, thats why I was asking if casters had any inside theory/knowledge about what comps they think would be able to time the 32. On live, Andybrews team timed it with a 1 min 40 left
[2:22:33] sLr_____: @ruediruempel cos it's not echo
[2:22:37] stiefbruderrr: Dratnos cam pls
[2:22:38] Arisolo: Echo had some bad runs day 1 with spires and a heartbreaking 0% wipe on 27 EOA that cost them a half hour
[2:22:42] ClumsyTaco: !gear
[2:22:43] Moobot: @ClumsyTaco More information on player Gear / Talents / Build can be found on Raider.IO: https://rio.gg/MainEventTGP2
[2:22:49] Arkshol: @littlesaintnz thats kinda cope tbh
[2:23:12] ominarous2: @Arisolo didnt echo also take a long time to get the 29 dos
[2:23:23] ScoobieRoo: but this chinease team.. \
[2:23:26] ConcernedGaming: @ruediruempel Echo isn't "Struggling" They are doing a respectable job. But they aren't big key pushers on live, and its a mixed team which is messing with dynamics. As well as having 2 NA players and 3 Eu players meaning Latency is a factor
[2:23:42] ominarous2: ^
[2:23:45] Alasacy: @ominarous2 yea they needed like 4 runs to get it
[2:24:07] scherri5: @komplexrules why are you watching it?
[2:24:27] Garysteel1984: 2020Drop
[2:24:28] Scheia: shadow priest <3
[2:24:47] littlesaintnz: echo is doing great, so is incarnation
[2:24:49] BizBichou: everyone on echo guardians has pushed high keys on live as well, but the team dynamic is harder to get when it's a combined team
[2:24:50] razor1n: did incarnation bow out?
[2:24:55] Arkshol: @sLr_____ thats a bad excuse tbh, and they havent played togheter for years, they have changed toster couple times
[2:25:00] NathalieDaPanda: thaner got a geared preist which he plays sometimes
[2:25:03] Hawkins_JJ: theyre taking a break
[2:25:09] BizBichou: @razor1n probably taking their break
[2:25:10] Emiliability: @razor1n they're taking a break rn
[2:25:12] Valhooli: @ruediruempel This is a great point. They are playing extremely well, I just think Aster and Method are playing that much better. Thats all it is
[2:25:16] ConcernedGaming: @razor1n Probably taking their mandated 15 min break
[2:25:33] bronwaterg: mandated LuL
[2:25:42] crestn: !caster
[2:25:42] Moobot: @crestn Today's casters are AutomaticJak, Doa, Dratnos, Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, and Xyronic

[2:25:55] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[2:26:03] CeejayDH: @sLr_____ no they havent, they have had to plug players a few times due to real life issues that arose, but they have consistently had the same roster for years
[2:26:06] littlesaintnz: i think it must be very hard to blend two top teams and expect synergy straight away
[2:26:38] duckborg: @Daborgon nope
[2:26:40] Tylarr_: @Daborgon they still have pvp tournaments
[2:26:41] Hawkins_JJ: wow still has pvp tournaments
[2:26:43] Malicone: wow method
[2:26:45] Redzone141: "Why is Echo playing so badly?" - someone who only does weekly 15s, and probably hasn't even timed a 20
[2:26:45] Plataneroh: imagine echo winning TGP when they dont push in live servers LUL
[2:26:48] Shearin77: pvp LUL
[2:26:48] SwaggWaggon: Dang aster would be crushing this key without the deaths
[2:26:52] kraiser1624: ummmm, did Meeixy forget that theres 2 more trashpacks before boss?
[2:26:54] littlesaintnz: im sure jpc and onezy had to rethink how theyd do thinks in ambition to the echo way
[2:26:56] ruediruempel: legion dungeons are better then BfA or Shadowlands dungeons in my opinion
[2:27:16] Strunngeng: lol no
[2:27:18] ominarous2: @SwaggWaggon they still definitely have time
[2:27:23] Hawkins_JJ: legion dungeons seem to depend more on healer anda damage checks than timer which is pretty cool
[2:27:29] skilled_fragi: Wotlk best balance pvp for arenas in wow history
[2:27:33] wildwittra: i believe
[2:27:43] ConcernedGaming: @skilled_fragi LOL
[2:27:44] albojah: Sanguine Depths is the best M+ dungeon ever
[2:27:49] acidtonicjd: How long do they have? Three more hours, is that correct?
[2:27:54] Emiliability: @skilled_fragi found the ret main
[2:27:56] razor1n: legion dungeons are interesting in different ways I feel, shadowlands dungeons challenege your damage, legion dungeons challenge survival
[2:28:04] ominarous2: @acidtonicjd yeah 5pm central
[2:28:07] Shearin77: @acidtonicjd yes
[2:28:11] Lorrdzik: @acidtonicjd yes 3h
[2:28:11] Rakazzor: @acidtonicjd last run hast to start before 0:00
[2:28:24] skilled_fragi: @emiliability war main tbh
[2:28:30] littlesaintnz: 5 hours isnt long enough each day.  they should have given 7 and made them take 4 15 min breaks
[2:28:34] SuperSionT: the wait before the boss pull was pretty long
[2:28:40] Lightz__: wheres incarnation
[2:28:50] elefant793: incran out or pausing?
[2:28:53] littlesaintnz: on break
[2:29:04] Lorrdzik: @littlesaintnz Why 5h is not good?
[2:29:06] ClumsyTaco: mage got exiled
[2:29:07] Arisolo: It‚Äôs still anyone‚Äôs game. Hardest part of this dungeon is the last boss and if any team wiped its -30 min for that team
[2:29:16] ClumsyTaco: not the monk, he died to comet storm when coming back
[2:29:17] ruediruempel: @littlesaintnz why not 30h a day is that enough time?
[2:29:19] Dbo_Games: Speed die for back fast to top and more damage on boss
[2:29:34] skilled_fragi: @spartan076 thats what many ppl say but imo mop pvp was bad , its not good when all classes have everything
[2:29:35] ominarous2: @Arisolo well with aster using the fleshcrafter, imo the hardest part of the dungeon is the first and second boss
[2:29:36] Malicone: monk died it is not good.
[2:29:39] Rakazzor: @ruediruempel 30h a day is not enough tbh
[2:29:53] Firesterz: aster missed a hook?
[2:30:09] Shearin77: i play 48 hours per day Kappa
[2:30:27] Arisolo: I‚Äôve done a bunch of high wakes. Not cutting edge stuff but I‚Äôm telling you the whole last boss feels like you‚Äôre gonna die and it takes forever
[2:30:43] browbeans: im so confused why would u choose to show them push NW and not 1 of the legion dungeons
[2:30:49] Malicone: Oh echo :(
[2:30:57] Mikefield: Incarnation did not +3 a 25

[2:31:13] SeathVII: !casting
[2:31:14] ConcernedGaming: @sneakyskogstad Because no one is doing a Legion dungeon right now
[2:31:21] Alasacy: @sneakyskogstad because they are not doing the legion dungeons right now?
[2:31:22] ruediruempel: was a mistake from echo to remove meeres from team tbh
[2:31:31] dkwarrior4: Aster pog
[2:31:33] Shearin77: @ominarous2 automod dislikes everyone
[2:31:35] Arkshol: doing high NW without priest is insane lol
[2:31:39] ollehxd: is there any way to unfuck this format and put a whole screen of the teams while keeping the cast? @Warcraft
[2:31:43] Caddyx: sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
[2:31:43] NashMarco: the last boss of NW is the best designed and balanced of shadowlands and if you don't think the same prob have below 1k rio
[2:31:45] Izkatu: @sneakyskogstad Nw is the shortest dungeon and easy to push
[2:31:52] ClumsyTaco: @ruediruempel didnt he remove himself ?
[2:31:52] Sathyron: @ruediruempel they did not remove him lol. Meeres himself didnt want to play anymore
[2:31:55] browbeans: Thats not what i mean, im talking about the they choose it for the last dungeon they can run
[2:31:59] sLr_____: they didnt remove him KEKW @ruediruempel he just didnt want to plau
[2:32:08] Rakazzor: @Arkshol on live they got the highest keys for NW without priest
[2:32:12] Sathyron: @ClumsyTaco yes, he quit himself
[2:32:15] Arkshol: Count modCheck
[2:32:17] gameofthrower: RNG KEKW
[2:32:19] DespiseNeville: @ruediruempel what do you mean, nobody was removed. They didnt wanted to play in MDI and Great Push this time
[2:32:21] SwaggWaggon: LOL when the cleaver use of game mechanics takes 2 long
[2:32:23] simplepathjg: o
[2:32:26] Arkshol: @Rakazzor ya, i know

[2:36:03] totopunchertv: why is warcraft back in twitch and not youtube ??
[2:36:05] spectrashock: very easy to skip oros in NW doesn't make the last boss that much harder at all

[2:36:11] 1xrayxray: 32 inc
[2:36:11] mrmudwaters: How did the mob get up there?
[2:36:18] CeejayDH: @CeejayDH i like it
[2:36:18] Rakazzor: Method go for 32 please <3
[2:36:24] Red_Queen____: @totopunchertv one-off events like this can be streamed on both plats
[2:36:37] Malicone: +3 gogo lol :D
[2:36:38] ya_ga_mi: Method have to play 31 first
[2:36:39] Dash_O_Pepper: just caster strats
[2:36:41] Sebleh: wildigWeird wildigSit wildigRoll1 wildigRoll2 wildigRoll3 wildigSit wildigPandaW Let's go Sheeesh!
[2:36:45] husselgaming: @nagura bc of cd timing maybe
[2:36:45] ruediruempel: @MrBlackwell teleport
[2:36:53] NashMarco: breaching of contract ofc
[2:36:57] 1xrayxray: Sheesh route is too slow for 32 imo
[2:37:06] Malicone: I think Method is going to win.
[2:37:15] cordead1974: @MrBlackwell aggro mobs will teleport up to you
[2:37:16] Raitox92: Maybe COS 28/29 first for Aster
[2:37:16] Malicone: Method EU right?
[2:37:23] ConcernedGaming: Whatever the cap for NW is. I'm willing to bet its 1 higher for those using the Fleshcrafter
[2:37:24] rhsiuol: Incarn doing weekly no leavers
[2:37:25] Dbo_Games: @1xrayxray nope
[2:37:25] wuyubohehe: They will definitely go 32
[2:37:26] eversmile413: Sheesh won't time 32 if they use current comp
[2:37:29] Chris_Twitch: Method #1
[2:37:30] jambo_the_nerd: @wesley869 lol what? andy plays paladin on live they were all on their mains in the 30 NW
[2:37:34] cjayen: @Malicone wow what a bold prediction
[2:37:35] ruediruempel: method > echo? sco will lol hard LUL
[2:37:38] Azmoddan: @Malicone players are from EU, yes
[2:37:50] NashMarco: method is back Pog
[2:38:07] Dbo_Games: they have a safe route for every dg they do and they never change
[2:38:10] Arkshol: There is no method NA for M+
[2:38:16] Sebleh: @Malicone This is not the Method EU from years ago.
[2:38:18] cjayen: method with an echo player, and others, are back :)
[2:38:24] Shearin77: method was never gone
[2:38:27] Malicone: Ok, I was unsure coz there is Method US. xD
[2:38:37] wesley12177: @jambo_the_nerd i know, what are u confused about
[2:38:41] Dabzy420: wait legion dungeons are back? :o
[2:38:42] cayna: No there is not?
[2:38:43] athenabtw: spin spin spin
[2:38:49] ominarous2: imo method having done so many 30/31 nw's on live is almost a disadvantage. because getting a 32 nw on live is impossible. so they havent had to optimize for a 32
[2:38:52] picc0: @cjayen 4 in the team are literally method raiders - ram is the only non method guy
[2:39:03] ominarous2: so now they're in a position with route and comp that i dont think they can make the adjustments for it
[2:39:03] ruediruempel: @Malicone method is eu guild, you should know this by now xD
[2:39:05] Celinia: Its pretty sad after Andy said "It is disgusting that method is trying to get back into the scene" when the big scandal happens and now he plays for them.
[2:39:06] AoD_Epherial: I feel like Cayna might know something about Method :)
[2:39:07] Lizzerazu: @Dabzy420 Timewalking event
[2:39:07] randramb: the old Method EU team is in large part the Echo team
[2:39:18] Dabzy420: ohh
[2:39:32] Dabzy420: i haven‚Äôt played in like 2 years
[2:39:33] jambo_the_nerd: @wesley869 your respond to my original comment made no sense lol "that was last tier he hasnt played monk...." like what is this even about lol
[2:39:37] cordead1974: @Malicone i think that only applied for pvp
[2:39:42] Thaddenn: @Celinia money talks more than words sometimes.
[2:39:47] Malicone: I know Method EU  but "Method Seesh" I was not sure. :D
[2:39:47] ominarous2: @Celinia i dont think andy had much of a choice. iirc he wasn't really in a great spot with his prior guild (pieces?)
[2:39:51] picc0: @ruediruempel you know that method also is an organisation? with NA ppl under contract
[2:39:52] BizBichou: @ominarous2 but that also means they could spend all their practise time in NW planning for a potential 32, while other teams had to figure out the lower levels too
[2:40:03] Dbo_Games: I'll be even happier when Method gets the WF once again with this new team
[2:40:07] sLr_____: @celinia did he really?
[2:40:08] Malicone: cordead1974 Ah, ok!
[2:40:10] chunkyb0b: @Dabzy420 washed dh
[2:40:15] Arkshol: @ominarous2 well, other teams chose not to push on live so isnt a disadvantage
[2:40:18] Rehppi: monk rogue mage wooo so fun ResidentSleeper

[2:40:41] ruediruempel: @Dbo_Games thats not gonna happen.
[2:40:41] ominarous2: @ominarous2 i think it helped contribute to a mindset thing like either it's not possible or it's not necessary so they never tried
[2:41:08] ominarous2: which i mean kinda shows in how aster is destroying these keys

[2:48:25] ominarous2: @aumixp theyve had problems on their 27 and also walked into NW later because they wanted to do EOA first
[2:48:37] Dbo_Games: @sLr_____ just see what Andy's team has been doing live, you don't need a crystal ball for that

[2:49:43] malicrin: some real room temp IQ takes
[2:49:50] ya_ga_mi: @rhsiuol 8 - 10% maybe idk
[2:49:57] sLr_____: @dbo_games I mean, Echo won last TGP and they werent pushing live either. im not saying Echo would 100% win. cos no one can say that. it's not possible to know xD
[2:49:59] SwaggWaggon: @malicrin less than

[2:52:22] sLr_____: @dbo_games yes. I know. they won.
[2:52:23] BizBichou: @Gruuoul the fact that they can use any comp imaginable. and easier access to the key. for NW32 you'd have to time any other dungeon on 31, which hasnt been done
[2:52:25] Xyronic: Kappa

[3:17:32] GrannyApple: my bro frag stuck in england or what is he doin man
[3:17:40] TheVirtualRealityCat: @Hephistos why you here talking and not playing in the TGP 2 then?
[3:17:47] sLr_____: @hephistos Pepega
[3:17:56] Konchita: @GrannyApple they combined Echo and Golden Guardians to make a team for this tournament
[3:17:59] yungbooma: @zacild i wanna see an average wow player do better at commucating PepeLaugh
[3:17:59] Knoakley: this is the great push for 36/36 mage tower, right?
[3:18:00] JanDeGrote1: frag did not want to play the great push @GrannyApple
[3:18:07] mrmudwaters: @gmoneyda_ticket Aster are actually very close
[3:18:11] textio545: u think astery can do 32 nw ?
[3:18:12] Bookies626: hi
[3:18:14] Rhao21: is this doa castin?
[3:18:15] cassone: @zacild I thought I was the only one that found it annoying
[3:18:18] eversmile413: 0% sheesh can do 32, it's already a near perfect run and they are running out of time
[3:18:26] Red_Queen____: @Rhao21 yes, and tettles
[3:18:26] Hephistos: @sLr_____ Just the reality... nothing else
[3:18:34] Gmoneyda_ticket: @MrBlackwell They're a whole boss fight behind right?
[3:18:37] Blazetenco: CheerForIncarn
[3:18:41] rumpadizzle: their is literally no comp diversity. its the same 2-3 dps
[3:18:48] JLassie: why be so rude @Stompsville ?
[3:18:49] Rhao21: @Rhao21 man I muss doas voice so much, thanks for the info
[3:18:54] textio545: u think shees will out of time this one they run ?
[3:19:03] Red_Queen____: @kaeyna sorry, nabbed you on accident
[3:19:09] sLr_____: @hephistos Pepega 2x
[3:19:10] Blazetenco: @rumpadizzle so a whole comp is just the dps players? tanks and healers don't matter?
[3:19:11] kaeyna: You guys scared me with that ban, I was wondering what I said monkaS
[3:19:11] Hephistos: @TheVaporizingCat Typical fan answer
[3:19:12] gutoldini: thaner plays disci
[3:19:13] rest87: you cant do 33+ without a priest
[3:19:26] captnmichael: The scaling is 6.5% The 10% scaling hasn't been in place
[3:19:28] mrmudwaters: Remember aster has a +2 (admittedly a dungeon not done on +29 this competition yet) for some quick points
[3:19:31] kaeyna: @The_Red__Queen Caught in the cross fire :D
[3:19:34] milsolo: Good point Dratnos
[3:19:38] Malicone: Just be nice! :D
[3:19:39] bluffkinn: why not take a DK if you can't play priest
[3:19:44] Red_Queen____: @kaeyna lol, yea, it moved right when i clicked xD
[3:19:46] Hawkins_JJ: @Gmoneyda_ticket different format to the MDI, you get 5 hours total you're not up against other temas simultaneously in the same dungeon
[3:19:46] Raitox92: Aster Y is on a really clean run atm. But not sure if 33 is possible
[3:19:46] JanDeGrote1: @kaeyna wrong place wrong time Kappa
[3:19:48] Healingstat: GG Method Sheeesh!
[3:19:56] Shearin77: gg method
[3:20:00] picc0: gg
[3:20:06] Method: sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh
[3:20:08] Caddyx: sheeeeeeeeesh
[3:20:12] nickolas52: method built different
[3:20:14] Dransel: 29 CoS has to be the least likely choice.
[3:20:15] Healingstat: Aster on pace for a World Record key right now
[3:20:19] BoDidely: sheeeeeeesh
[3:20:21] meeeeeeeeeeeeel: GG Method!
[3:20:26] textio545: i think shees can do 32 nw also and they start soa 29
[3:20:28] Omnimorphic: 34 min+10% > 37 min, they can't do it
[3:20:38] Gmoneyda_ticket: @Hawkins_JJ AHhhh
[3:20:44] blackmaija: should not have had NW as the last dungeon, its such a cheesy dungeon
[3:20:46] Adaqeu: 30 dos
[3:20:48] CHAOSxDECAY: sheeesh
[3:20:54] rhsiuol: incarn weekly no leavers
[3:21:04] Mauclaurin: How much time is left?
[3:21:05] Dbo_Games: @Adaqeu Not possible
[3:21:05] textio545: i think 29 dos tyranical is enought
[3:21:06] just_ok_viewer: aster.y just two bosses away now
[3:21:12] rumpadizzle: @Blazetenco their are 3 druid tanks lmao
[3:21:13] sLr_____: @textio545 no shot they do 32 with no priest
[3:21:15] Gruuoul: what are the rules again if 2 teams have same points ?
[3:21:16] Blazetenco: I love incarn and I'm very happy they made to today
[3:21:19] spectrashock: @OMNIMORPHIC that's not how it works in necrotic wake, the weapon damage also scales so u aren't losing as much time
[3:21:27] ruediruempel: ty mods for 10min ban
[3:21:28] Shearin77: @Mauclaurin 2h13m
[3:21:35] textio545: @Gruuoul time betwen dungeon they do ofc
[3:21:36] Moobot: Follow WoW Esports on Twitter! http://www.Twitter.com/WoWEsports
[3:21:46] Blazetenco: @Gruuoul they would compare highest keys, then time I think to tie break
[3:21:57] Dbo_Games: HoA and DoS are already at the maximum limit with these affix
[3:21:59] Zuthos8: Would they need a 32 even if they have  overall larger score? Like say they are 173 score with a 28 EoA, from METHOD, and Aster gets 28 SoA and 32 NW, then it would be 173 score vs 172 score?
[3:22:00] rwdxr: incarns been tilted since they announced NW you could tell by comms and  I can't even blame them
[3:22:19] Alasacy: @Dbo_Games dos is doable on 30
[3:22:25] rwdxr: aster has a 29 cos
[3:22:26] destress: You know what is the main point? That the teams are having fun ... and the casters ... and the viewers :) it still is a game!
[3:22:27] Meeix: its score > highest keys > overall time
[3:22:28] Azmoddan: @Dbo_Games 30 DoS probably doable but they dont have the time
[3:22:34] sam_promise: 30 HOAs
[3:22:35] zormaan: @rwdxr why tilted?
[3:22:41] Rakazzor: @Zuthos8 no, if they have a higher score they win, higher key just matters on same score
[3:22:47] ConcernedGaming: @Zuthos8 The first Tiebreaker is "Highest key" so if the score is 175 - 175 but one team has a 32. The one with the 32 wins
[3:22:47] kaeyna: @Zuthos8 Whoever has the most point wins. If they are tied on point then it's whoever has the highest key.
[3:22:48] littlesaintnz: NW shouldnt have been included
[3:22:49] Kronick15: is anyone streaming on method sheeesh?
[3:22:54] Fuubwow: 100% they are going for a 30 halls
[3:22:57] Dbo_Games: have to see how the damage of the last boss will be now on 32
[3:23:11] Zuthos8: That's what I thought, but casters were saying "If Aster completes this 32 the other teams need it too." Which... is...wrong?
[3:23:12] sLr_____: sheesh shalso yes tettles
[3:23:14] Raitox92: Can we have aster y fullscreen for the final minutes?
[3:23:22] Omnimorphic: is aster.y on pace?
[3:23:23] blegobleg: this concept of pve tournament is nice !!
[3:23:25] sam_promise: 30 HOA has already been talked about....thats def the go
[3:23:33] Pulsarite: TYRANNICAL METHOD SHEEESH POG
[3:23:39] Shearin77: let's go aster
[3:23:42] hexabtw: @Zuthos8 If it comes down to a tie breaker, than aster y will win based on having the 32
[3:23:43] littlesaintnz: @kev27712 no, for some reason they prefer not to stream
[3:23:43] Raitox92: @OMNIMORPHIC yes
[3:23:45] Dbo_Games: @Alasacy before they go to it I believe they will go to the other dgs
[3:23:48] textio545: 6min for last boss ? omg
[3:23:52] Tekniqz: he can @tettles hes running mass
[3:24:07] Dbo_Games: @textio545 small time
[3:24:11] Alasacy: @Dbo_Games yea, 29 cos is more doable than dos
[3:24:12] Hawkins_JJ: @rwdxr NW can be pushed higher than any key so basically means the whole day is going to be spent pushing that key. Incarnation came in with lowest score so gives them no time to improve other dungeons
[3:24:15] Shearin77: plz no dc
[3:24:19] textio545: most shees problem is no switching class mosly by thaner ;/
[3:24:25] dkwarrior4: Cam on Aster pls :)

[3:24:29] Raitox92: They can do it! +32, lets go, Aster.Y!

[3:24:30] mrmudwaters: Why don‚Äôt they kill the guy before the boss?

[3:27:48] sLr_____: @gashtag Pepega
[3:27:58] kimohunt: Aster Y going SOA
[3:27:59] just_ok_viewer: strategically, i think aster.y has to do 28 SOA before 33 NW

[3:28:29] simplepathjg: @Lazerdruid12 they dont have avoidance which is huge...
[3:28:30] 1xrayxray: The classic "its not on live server so not really"
[3:28:38] SwaggWaggon: They should head to head anyways that would be way more hype
[3:28:40] sLr_____: @lazerdruid12 at this point in a patch you have better gear live than you have in TR cos for terciaries. so it's even a better record
[3:28:45] Alasacy: @Lazerdruid12 they legit have better gear on live
[3:28:46] Nataurz: Head 2 Head  Head 2 Head
[3:28:48] ominarous2: @wildwittra i think they really should do the rest of their 28'

[3:29:01] Sankasa1909: Where was it that there was a coinflip for the win or something dumb?
[3:29:01] ThunderWielder007: @Samantha_Promise doing a 32 with 4 minutes left says the opposite
[3:29:03] kaeyna: @Lazerdruid12 To be fair their gear can be better on live than on TR because of leech and avoidance
[3:29:04] Lorrdzik: @picc0 But if they deplete they need to get that jey again. Here they just reset dungeon.
[3:29:06] kuhrazzyy: tb 2 should be head to head that would be insane
[3:29:15] kimohunt: Aster Y probably gonna take SOA +28 and try COS +28/29 before try to take on NW +33
[3:29:18] Meeix: aster.y üíî theyll do the 33+ later I BELIEVE
[3:29:21] VincentVanGoat: lol
[3:29:22] eversmile413: Push Seat of the Triumvirate in 2 hrs for H2H
[3:29:26] Hellgaunt: @SwaggWaggon if keys didn't deplete on live there wouldn't be so big difference. Gear is rather irrelevant since these players have that gear on live as well. But keys not depleting is HUGE
[3:29:37] fremen14: @Meeix great casting from you!
[3:29:41] ConcernedGaming: If they ever need to go to the third Tiebreaker, it means the Average time for both is the same down to the exact Second. If that happens the world will shatter
[3:29:44] picc0: @Lorrdzik true, but on TR there is no avoidance/leech which helps a lot

[3:30:31] MagmagBlegben: when is the tourney done?
[3:30:38] anydayanytime: tournment ends today ?
[3:30:39] Lorrdzik: @picc0 I still think be able to try dungeon infinity time is better than one try maybe per day or days because randomnes of keys on live.
[3:30:44] Red_Queen____: @anydayanytime yes
[3:30:50] ruediruempel: 2 hourd

[3:47:11] admiralalaadin: @bizbichou the two top high key runners who are competing in TGP for the first time, both of them competed in mdi the first time. You compare those with the likes of meeres and Frag? I don‚Äôt think so
[3:47:21] fremen14: @Redzone141 im timing 27s wdym? dont speak for us just because youre bad lol

[4:18:35] JobrX: @Coachhx based on what? COS 29 isn't easy and sheesh can still finish EOA 28 and do 30 dos
[4:18:37] neels_ofc: They win w 28 even @arkshol if sheesh don‚Äôt time anything else
[4:18:43] bohttv: WF 32 more impressive on tourney cause no tertiaries
[4:18:49] ziyenna: @textio545 they dont have a good enough priest
[4:18:56] Arkshol: @ne3lstv ya
[4:19:00] Feroxita1337: !casters
[4:19:01] Moobot: @Feroxita1337 Today's casters are AutomaticJak, Doa, Dratnos, Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, and Xyronic
[4:19:09] blardoh: @sLr_____ Because you can keep trying to key over and over.
[4:19:12] Sathyron: I dont think Method will get another point. Aster will time 28 or 29 COS and therefore win
[4:19:14] seddonas: who is going to come out on top
[4:19:15] sLr_____: @erostg no. 172 never beats 173 cos 172<173
[4:19:15] Bixboarn: Sheeeeshhhhh WR
[4:19:17] Arkshol: @Coachhx nah DOS 30 its to time investing
[4:19:36] EzzLyfe: @llobohh yes and no, they have a geared priest alt which they dont have on live
[4:19:38] Digitalcrit: why echo is insisting on that healer priest is not clear
[4:19:39] logarthz1: they get 2 points from COS
[4:19:49] Karenius: i
[4:19:51] logarthz1: if they are tied its aster's win
[4:19:54] picc0: @Digitalcrit for the mc
[4:19:58] erostg: @sLr_____ oh yeah, I meant with 173, they beat them because of the +2 even tho they have the same points right?
[4:20:06] textio545: @Digitalcrit they mind controll one mob for 3rd and last boss
[4:20:11] sLr_____: @blardoh kk and?
[4:20:14] Arkshol: Aster gotta get into 29 CoS its their best option
[4:20:18] textio545: this one who throw something XD
[4:20:20] awesomeraff: Fun fact: if you type 4533333345 on a calculator and turn it upside down. You get sheeeesh. You're welcome
[4:20:29] logarthz1: @sLr_____ with same points aster will win cuz of 32
[4:20:35] 0mmurg: @textio545 i took that more to meann why a heal priest instead of dps priest but idk
[4:20:37] sLr_____: @erostg both with 173 aster wins cos they have a 32
[4:20:39] EzzLyfe: Hhahahaha
[4:20:41] Thaddenn: incarnation wiping in 29 hoa for the last hour
[4:20:46] Laxelablee: someone knows what the chinese livestream is called?

[4:21:08] Ignatios12: why is legion m+ in this?
[4:21:09] RubYshZ: @Laxelablee ***
[4:21:10] CtrlSoul: douyu
[4:21:12] Red_Queen____: @Reinforce_TV Meeix and Naguura
[4:21:14] Laxelablee: tyty
[4:21:16] erostg: oh, so basically timing it +2 or +3 doesnt really make a difference here?
[4:21:17] Arkshol: yeah, anyone can Dm the chinese stream?
[4:21:31] ZullXv: @Ignatios12 because its in live right now
[4:21:37] nhmek: @Laxelablee it is not in twitch, they are their own streaming service
[4:21:47] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: they stream on medal tv
[4:21:50] CrerisRs: erostg same score goes to sum of times I think, so technically it does but not as heavily
[4:21:55] reggiepowa: nope
[4:21:55] Ignatios12: so legion m+ wont normally be in the mdi?
[4:21:57] zaxii2807: @laxelablee Yup what red Queen Said, look on wow esport Twitter they posted it in a reelt to their "asterY team members "
[4:21:59] nisk___: echo cant win from here
[4:22:01] Lorrdzik: they cant
[4:22:02] Arkshol: NVM just got the chinese stream link
[4:22:06] 11000BG: no nagura
[4:22:08] Dransel: Echo almost certainly can't win at this point.

[4:22:15] logarthz1: no way echo can win even if they time every key
[4:22:17] becskerex: what aster literally did a wr in a tourny realm
[4:22:26] HaveYouSeenMikey: there is 0 change for echo what are you talking about
[4:22:31] Thoreya: nah echo is done
[4:22:38] grospey: Why are they playing l√©gion
[4:22:38] Tussep: @erostg No, that has no value other than you get to skip running that extra dungeon. What matters is your total points and your highest completed key
[4:22:39] ZullXv: @Ignatios12 not typically no depends if they decided to make it permenant but its just Time walking legion right now
[4:22:42] matching_towels: @erostg it does if they do a key after, e.g. aster has a 27++ so they can go straight into a 29 attempt
[4:22:43] dillyinsertclasshere: !casters
[4:22:44] Moobot: @dillyinsertclasshere Today's casters are AutomaticJak, Doa, Dratnos, Meeix, Naguura, Tettles, and Xyronic

[4:22:58] 11000BG: echo can theoreticaly win if all other teams withdraw from tournament
[4:22:59] SwaggWaggon: Echo Court is to low not enough time
[4:23:06] Lorrdzik: Echo is 4 points behind, it cant happen
[4:23:08] neels_ofc: If they time cos 29 it‚Äôs over
[4:23:10] Dransel: The real question is whether Method Sheesh can find another point, forcing Aster.Y to complete a 29 CoS rather than just a 28.
[4:23:10] pega_pega_confia_322: BDK KEK

[4:24:04] EzzLyfe: OH NO THE BDK IS GONE
[4:24:08] astrosca1: HahaGingercat

[4:24:43] CheymiRG: 2 CoS = 1 hour Echo is done
[4:24:50] logarthz1: @Dransel we saw 29 is doable
[4:24:59] Thaddenn: I found the rogue perspective on aster.y
[4:25:00] EzzLyfe: it feels like Method and Aster have hit a wall already
[4:25:00] chabouy: Sanguine healing tho
[4:25:02] spectrashock: brutal caster curse
[4:25:04] matching_towels: wish they could fit the timer below the leaderboard here
[4:25:12] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: the end of this tournament is kinda anticlimactic compared to the last tgp
[4:25:14] cinn_3: gogo 30 dos
[4:25:20] logarthz1: method has to time two keys and both of them is giga hard :D
[4:25:29] littlesaintnz: aster only need 1 point to tie
[4:25:30] eversmile413: Echo has to do 28 COS then 29 COS and overtime 32 NW and there's chance
[4:25:34] Shearin77: @matching_towels don't you have a clock on your computer?
[4:25:39] Blazetenco: lol dorki saying "sheesh just pulled an us" LUL

[4:25:40] BDSM_Zyra: @gdzie_jest_wojtyla Thought I was the only one who found this version of it boring
[4:25:51] muse_less: I mean timer is misleading -- it is a countdown til they can start their last key, no?
[4:25:55] fruno016: echo is goodbye already

[4:27:29] logarthz1: @hipnotidz dont think they did it on tyra
[4:27:32] silmarilen: @hipnotidz on live they probably had easier affixes
[4:27:36] picc0: @hipnotidz cause they first have to time a 28
[4:27:43] mrmudwaters: @hipnotidz worse affix maybe? Dunno
[4:27:43] toyfluffy: There is a low chance aster will not time this 29
[4:27:49] Sevin272: but why 29 bro
[4:27:52] Zadeyh: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[4:27:54] Coachhx: i don't think aster times 29 cos with that comp. You need prot pal to help the venth hpal heal last boss. DH can't help at all
[4:27:56] logarthz1: oh they did time 29 spires on tyra but with 8 seconds close :D

[4:29:06] jozuo: wait you get your artifacts in the legion dungeons?
[4:29:08] logarthz1: 29 spires is very hard and even 1 death means its not doable
[4:29:09] toyfluffy: @toyfluffy but its easier than 32  NW
[4:29:10] Red_Queen____: @mrihonvbere 1hr 5 mins

[4:31:51] LordThearius: Ok, but CoS it's such an amazing Dungeon. Happy to see it again
[4:31:52] rest87: Echo is gonna comeback, they always do. Too strong when it counts
[4:31:58] Hawkins_JJ: 32 NW without a Spriest is nigh on impossible
[4:32:02] logarthz1: @Rekatronn with that comp 32 nw ? no way
[4:32:05] Shearin77: @Feax_XIV 1 hour
[4:32:06] username12345678911: excuses
[4:32:10] CaptainAlkohol: @Rekatronn they probably dont have the priest strat practiced?

[4:32:35] gdzie_jest_wojtyla: did yoda ditch TGP for endwalker or
[4:32:43] mrmudwaters: @lordthearius did it first time this week, love it! Can‚Äôt say the same for EoA :p
[4:32:47] richie918: "not on the same level as the rest of the team"
[4:32:49] EzzLyfe: @gdzie_jest_wojtyla yup
[4:33:01] AdeX_poe: !bracket
[4:33:04] Tussep: Echo doesn't have the time to clear enough dungeons to get the points they're missing it seems
[4:33:06] JobrX: @EzzLyfe Thaner plays priest, I guess they didn't practice it for this TGP tho
[4:33:12] kjuurt: at this point its methods tournament to lose really
[4:33:29] becskerex: tricky situation = plagueborer usage
[4:33:29] Tekniqz: It‚Äôs more aster Ys tournament to lose
[4:33:36] Rekatronn: @ezzlyfe oh i didnt realise, assume everyone was doing that strat, that puts them in kind of a bad position assuming aster can time cos 29
[4:33:39] juzxe: NW 32?WOW
[4:33:43] EzzLyfe: @kjuurt not really, if Aster timet his they win on tiebreker
[4:33:46] rwdxr: It's asters tournament to lose, they just need to tie to auto win
[4:33:48] Sumirina: both aster and method still really close
[4:33:57] TheCatblob: If Echo wins next Great Push then JPC becomes a candidate for Ewing Theory
[4:34:03] ironlaw98: But it is true, they are not on pair with the usual echo players
[4:34:04] Izkatu: @EzzLyfe they a druid too for root
[4:34:04] EzzLyfe: @Rekatronn yep, its gonna come down to the last dungeon of the day
[4:34:09] Sevin272: aster only have to time 28 for a win right now
[4:34:15] TheVirtualRealityCat: awesome to see how Aster Y is grow
[4:34:17] Tussep: @kjuurt It's Asters to win. They are way ahead if they can time their CoS
[4:34:20] textio545: @rwdxr its not +1 point just for them for this 29 ?
[4:34:20] mrmudwaters: @juzxe what, you don‚Äôt do +32s last minute Tuesday evenings for the vault?
[4:34:22] gremble: gingi on the necrolord mage :O
[4:34:22] logarthz1: if aster times 29 cos high chance they win
[4:34:25] knightswithkiera: Oh really? Watching on my phone so it‚Äôs hard to see
[4:34:28] HistoryNameRefrence: does aster have less points because they 2 chested 27?
[4:34:28] Mac_Twistnether: @rest87 LUL

[4:34:39] Dransel: Aster back from break. Wonder what key they'll do, the 28 or 29
[4:34:40] EzzLyfe: @Rekatronn they might go for a DOS 30 instead tho to win on points not tiebreaker
[4:34:43] muse_less: Ready check poggers
[4:34:43] Shearin77: i'm rdy
[4:34:52] sLr_____: @kjuurt is it? is it tho? Aster has a pretty straightfoward path to victory
[4:34:52] Dransel: ooo 29
[4:34:54] BoDidely: r
[4:34:57] Kahlandra: today is the last day, we'll have our winner in an hour or so
[4:34:57] sniffuu: @HistoryNameRefrence they have 2 less from cos and 1 more from NW = 1 less
[4:35:00] neels_ofc: Aster should just do the 28 for now
[4:35:06] Kahlandra: teams only have 1 hour left to start a dungeon
[4:35:09] Gandrik: ptsd triggered with the readycheck sound
[4:35:14] just_ok_viewer: resto shaman gives 10% health, might be good for survivability
[4:35:14] Ahylles_97: How mutch time they still have ?
[4:35:14] Azmoddan: where is mistweaver BigBrother
[4:35:14] kjuurt: well they are going for the 29 instead of the 28 to put the pressure on method
[4:35:20] HistoryNameRefrence: lol they kind of hurt themselves by 2 chesting @sniffuu
[4:35:22] neels_ofc: 29 without prot pala heals PridePog PridePog PridePog
[4:35:24] Red_Queen____: @riceslayer001 teams were eliminated the first 2 days, today determines the winner

[4:35:55] Gandrik: me too haha
[4:35:55] Tussep: @ne3lstv They win the tournament with a 29 regardless of what Method does though. With a 28 they still risk losing if Method takes another point
[4:36:00] sniffuu: @HistoryNameRefrence well no, now they can do 29 instant and they dont need to do 28, altso doin 28 could be the play since atm its enough assuming method doesnt get any other +1

[4:36:57] kjuurt: id rather see aster go for the 28 cos, put the pressure on methods eoa and its a lot less sketchy then the 29
[4:37:02] AndreaJonjo: he just casually won a world 1st on pala, for sure not confortable on the spec
[4:37:06] riceslayer001: Thanks for the info Kahlandra and The_Red__Queen!
[4:37:08] Rekatronn: @ezzlyfe yeah, aster is in a really good position with tiebreaket secured, then they just have to tie methods points

[4:40:05] Sathyron: @Asgar2706 only Onezy, JPC is really good
[4:40:10] fikus0404: @Asgar2706 why are they using subs?

[4:40:56] EzzLyfe: @Asgar2706 their 2 sub dps were third place on the MDI lmao
[4:40:58] Shred_Flanders: @fikus0404 they arent subs. JPC and Onezy are from ambition, but rest of their team couldnt participate so they joined incomplete echo team
[4:41:03] worthtv: @ziyenna what are u saying x
[4:41:10] Mac_Twistnether: @ziyenna LUL
[4:41:10] captnmichael: Is it just me or are onezy's and jpc's mental a bit frickle Same thing in last TGP as well You could see them panicking
[4:41:11] Sathyron: @littlesaintnz Onezy managed to literally die SEVEN times in their first serious NW 31 attempt. Everyone else died zero times (till they wiped completey). Its not just "one misplay"
[4:41:11] ruediruempel: echo played bad yes
[4:41:14] Nivaly: @qtsage I dont know if thats true. Thaners group has done a 29 dos but there time was 1.5 min slower

[4:42:32] qtsage: @Nivaly wdym dude. there's never been a 32 nw timed before which is what the tag below it on-screen means. A 29 dos has been timed before, so not sure what your point is
[4:42:35] TheCatblob: Problem was that they didn't go with Golden Echo as the name; didn't have that winning mentality in the name
[4:42:39] Arniboy: Remember BfA Freehold "Brutale R√ºckhand"
[4:42:47] Tukor: @sLr_____ words
[4:42:49] EzzLyfe: @ziyenna considering how they are still top 3 even with subs it means that they just need more practice as a team

[4:42:51] textio545: jpc is best rogue from last seson lol about what u talk

[4:43:22] sLr_____: @thecatblob True
[4:43:24] 1xrayxray: @ne3lstv The chinese team also was doing MDI and barely pushed on live
[4:43:24] Shred_Flanders: @ziyenna to be fair, last great push win by echo was due to their 5head brain, they weren't as good in high key pushing for some time because they don't really do it full time
[4:43:40] EzzLyfe: @Gandrik well NA just woke up :D
[4:43:44] kestito: i played all melees in legion
[4:43:46] Cruzzioz: is it 00:00 timer ends to start a new dungeon?

[4:44:07] imseifist: @Cruzzioz yes
[4:44:09] awwelul: Gingi is washed up powder seller
[4:44:12] textio545: last great push win by echo for most of ppl is abusing not skill as another group
[4:44:13] snapshotgg: does china team stream?
[4:44:16] neels_ofc: @1xrayxray they have played a lot , I speak w qingxin often
[4:44:17] zaxii2807: @cruzzioz Yup

[4:44:26] sLr_____: @awwelul KEKW
[4:44:35] Rekatronn: Aster is just gonna try for 29 for the rest of the time, and if they are not maling it, just drop it to 28 just before timer stops and time the 28 to win on tiebreaket assuming method is not gonna time any more keys
[4:44:39] ruediruempel: echo is washed tbh
[4:44:40] EzzLyfe: @awwelul watch his stream some day, you will see how insane he actually is
[4:45:00] kjuurt: assuming they 1 shot the 28
[4:45:01] RobotB0FA: Gingi is necro Pog
[4:45:07] cassone: @ruediruempel Yeah they should probably stop playing wow /s
[4:45:14] toyfluffy: @textio545 They got a tactic and it worked, like the Priest tactic for Aster this time... there is no abuse
[4:45:15] flipeex: who is this new caster?
[4:45:15] kjuurt: which is quite a gamble to put the tournament win on
[4:45:17] gottaProc: is aster.y stream link somewhere?
[4:45:18] Lorrdzik: @ruediruempel KEKW
[4:45:20] 1xrayxray: @ne3lstv If  you are talking about tr practice yes but not on live
[4:45:22] snapshotgg: @ruediruempel its the NA gaming feels like
[4:45:22] Nivaly: @qtsage Well on rio (and by the rules of tie-breaking in this tournament) better times are worth more. thereby the DOS of echo is currently the World Best timed key for that dungeon.
[4:45:23] matching_towels: all teams did great, stop being toxic some of you
[4:45:32] sLr_____: @1xrayxray nah, dude, Aster plays 15h pretty much everyday just spamming dungeons. either high keys or mdi style. l
[4:45:33] Karenius: melee mains GIGACHAD
[4:45:42] EzzLyfe: @flipeex Meeix. A raider from Method I think

[4:46:18] picc0: @EzzLyfe meeix is not a raider of method
[4:46:19] Coachhx: COS proabbly the most boring dungeon to watch. At least the bosses are hard
[4:46:24] 1xrayxray: @ne3lstv yea i know this
[4:46:24] ruediruempel: tourament format is better then normal mdi in my opinion
[4:46:34] toyfluffy: @textio545 since everyone had the same chance to "abuse" this its still a fair tournament
[4:46:38] qtsage: @Nivaly im not denying that. you seem mad that they arent shouting your boys in echo out. All i was replying to initially is that 29 dos has been timed before, unlike 32 NW, hence the special note on screen. learn to read
[4:46:44] EzzLyfe: @picc0 oh sry, no idea why that was in my head

[5:14:35] GenericAnimeName: all of it
[5:14:37] sLr_____: @sathyron you mean Echo has more practice ?üëÄ
[5:14:38] ttiewinwt: why have neither of the other teams gone for 32 NW like aster?
[5:14:38] ominarous2: +30 dos is a good call because they'll know whether they can time it in the enxt 20 minutes
[5:14:50] ominarous2: they can just reset it and go for eoa again if it isnt looking good
[5:15:08] ominarous2: because the worst part of dos is actually the first 20 minutes, whereas eoa is the last 5
[5:15:11] driver1: I would wager that sheesh timed a 30 dos in practice
[5:15:11] Chavly123: If Echo finishes this 29, they really should be going into a 28 SoA. they have a big time advantage over sheesh
[5:15:12] Moadmoad: that raging mask isnt playing
[5:15:36] shox_wow: how are they gonna play the other mask üëÄ
[5:15:39] Esotraz: they clearly do so wrong moad :)
[5:15:42] rest87: no, 32 NW is much easier then a 28 spires
[5:15:42] Grimm303: They're planning 32 NW
[5:15:49] spectrashock: @shoxwowtv later
[5:16:09] Dransel: it's crazy because Aster.Y could probably time the 33 NW as well
[5:16:13] just_ok_viewer: 32 NW is only easier if you get to reset the first pull on a wipe
[5:16:13] AndreaJonjo: did incarn just stopped doing keys?
[5:16:14] moomoostrike: if echo time this and they both wipe echo will win ?
[5:16:21] Dransel: They had a lot of time on that 32
[5:16:28] logarthz1: i dont get going to 30 dos
[5:16:34] rest87: 30 dos is not doable
[5:16:35] Mac_Twistnether: @moomoostrike no. echo needs another key
[5:16:37] kimohunt: @moomoostrike no, echo need to +1 more
[5:16:39] Peettko: If Aster times 33 NW i will grow hair again
[5:16:40] Tantunter: @moomoostrike no they neew nw 32 too
[5:16:44] Madas: @moomoostrike They have to time their 29 CoS AND time another dungeon
[5:16:45] krezay: @moomoostrike echo will also have to time another key but yes

[5:17:27] Seliathan: lots of assumptions based on echo timing 29cos, but their comp is really awkward for last boss imo
[5:17:28] kimohunt: @molo316 they have 17min to start a key, so they need to finish and quickly start a new key-

[5:19:02] logarthz1: aster just has to do their key and they win . method wont win with that 30 dos
[5:19:06] cwjShen: is echo just gonna try and time this 29 and go back to spires?
[5:19:12] Rofyx: @Seliathan it is possible to DN
[5:19:13] jacksplatt: is this replacing MDI?
[5:19:14] Seliathan: true, never bet against zaelia

[5:19:31] kinvaras_: @Zenwreckx yup
[5:19:36] kimohunt: @cwjShen they need to time this and try 32 NW to be sure that they had a chance.
[5:19:36] Mariosnek: onezy and jpc are playing defensive trinkets
[5:19:42] sLr_____: @menzlo TOP is not available this tourney
[5:19:42] ttiewinwt: why haven't the other teams done 32 NW? is it really hard and it was like a miracle that aster managed to do it?
[5:19:42] Healingstat: Necrolord time :D
[5:19:43] periperus: @cwjShen they have to go to NW if they want to win, nit spires.
[5:19:48] kimohunt: but if Aster timed this +29 its over for Echo
[5:19:54] ominarous2: @cwjShen or 28 soa :)
[5:19:56] Maxpouer: what about if Echo do +29 CoS and after go Spires 28 and all another fail?

[5:20:17] bo3rni: y jpc and onezy are playing dos tank trinkets ^^
[5:20:22] logarthz1: @ttiewinwt it needs priest comp. sheesh havent practiced that and echo just didnt have time
[5:20:23] Red_Queen____: ayinStab
[5:20:23] menzlo: remember when max said he'd watch this all day
[5:20:24] cwjShen: why would they go 32 nw instead of 28 spires, which most of the other teams seam to do easily
[5:20:27] winnem89: why would aster.y win if they got same score as method sheesh? while if echo got same as aster echo win?
[5:20:27] matching_towels: @ttiewinwt time is against them all, they picked lower hanging fruit (easier options)
[5:20:33] sLr_____: @maxpouer head to head match with Aster I think
[5:20:37] richie918: Method could easily be third
[5:20:48] bebincalicious: Echo PogBones
[5:20:49] periperus: @cwjShen to win a tiebreak with if it ends on 173.
[5:20:50] kimohunt: @Maxpouer if other 2 teams failed and echo time this and another key (whichever) then Echo win by time advantage from less time used
[5:21:00] R0NGG: aster mage isnt necro he has pod debuff

[5:22:46] kjuurt: @Naguura spectater bug you mean? They actually doing 28 not 29?
[5:22:57] Naguura: @MittNavnErTobi if aster depletes 29 CoS and sheesh doesnt time the 30, then Echo could also win with a 28 Spires, but it would come down to time comparison (not sure who has fasters times between sheeesh and echo atm)
[5:22:59] KinarPT: thanks @kimohunt
