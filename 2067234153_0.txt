[0:26:21] Anhak: MY RAID TEAM IS DIEING IRL
[0:27:02] Rainbowmes: dying would be better than this
[0:29:57] Devcomz: Hi Mes hope your day has been better than mine had a pretty discouraging day of queues in the solo shuffle world. Healers whispering me not to play the spec I want to play cause I am griefing :( When I just want to have fun on it and climb
[0:30:32] nikthevoker: what spec?
[0:31:05] Devcomz: Was playing some Assa Rogue I am actually really enjoying it but I guess Im griefing lol
[0:31:29] nikthevoker: nah not griefing, they arent bad
[0:37:51] Devcomz: I went 5-1 in one of the lobbies they whispered but man like people are out there thinking im trying to grief when Im not I actually dont like outlaw
[0:37:51] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[0:38:50] Anhak: sin is less set up based then outlaw and in my experience set up while it can work in shuffle isnt neerly as good just cause coms and stuff so like there is give and take there too
[0:39:01] Devcomz: Im not the greatest player but I think being 2200 mmr isnt too bad I even pealed my healer
[0:39:12] Devcomz: in shuffle
[0:39:22] Anhak: SMOrc you did what
[0:39:46] Devcomz: peeled the heals so they didnt die
[0:40:04] Anhak: slash ban devcomz
[0:40:13] Devcomz: :(
[0:40:16] Anhak: SMOrc only veev
[0:41:29] Devcomz: What is veev?
[0:42:58] Anhak: well true veeving is train healer til yours dies or theirs but veev was a pro mostly warrior player who won bcon? i think it was and he was kinda known for that playstyle which in late cata and mop became known as veeving
[0:43:39] Devcomz: ah ok
[0:43:43] Devcomz: I learned something new
[0:45:21] Anhak: yea 2009 bcon i believe they are the reason tsg is called tsg but i might be wrong
[0:48:42] nikthevoker: is it bad if i cant feel my fingers? LUL

[2:22:42] littledealerxxx: common on cruises, and kindergartens
[2:23:01] healhut: crackers and sprite are good

[2:25:56] littledealerxxx: norovirus is an RNA virus which means it can mutate very quickly… while it’s uncommon to get it twice within a short span it is possible… (the other problem with norovirus is that it’s outside capsid structure makes it very good at sitting around on surfaces and stuff for up to multiple months
[2:26:25] americanmoses18: mes you got blue hair itis man happens
[2:29:30] testoe: whats your solution on inflation?
[2:29:54] littledealerxxx: yeah probably unlikely hopefully you and your loved ones feel better soon!
[2:30:23] al_capow: you need a way to play ranked without an ilvl requirement
[2:30:33] al_capow: so people can jump in and play with friends and get pvp exposure on day 1
[2:30:46] littledealerxxx: I find it just so hard to get a 3s team at lower mmr…
[2:30:52] shugguls: @al_capow gear is so easy its not ilvl
[2:31:03] al_capow: for a brand new player to wow, it is 100% ilvl
[2:31:14] Arsinalx: @littledealerxxx bc of shuffle
[2:31:15] al_capow: the only people who are getting ilvl asap are people who know where to go
[2:31:30] shugguls: i got fully geared in 2 days
[2:31:47] Arsinalx: shuffle kills 2s/3s and rbg (already dead before shuffle was introduce to wow in eu)
[2:31:52] czechjester13: the only way a brand new player has any hope in this game is if they are handheld for 2-3 months every step of way lol
[2:31:59] littledealerxxx: I think they somehow need to get more healers into pvp because at least in 2s u can get away without a healer
[2:32:05] Idgtst: they should probably make 3's be the most efficient content to farm conquest and honor at a minimum
[2:32:24] littledealerxxx: but login and waiting around 1 hr to find a healer just feels bad when I could just q 2s and shuffle
[2:32:28] Drathimos: i think they should just uncap mmr but reduce the crap out of cr gain per game. that way you feel like you're not restrained but still feel like you're making prog by climbing cr little by little
[2:32:34] shugguls: @czechjester13 that i agree with, tried to get a friend in but it was too fast for him to learn
[2:32:34] BlueStorm91: imagine loving shuffle
[2:32:37] Arsinalx: shuffle is garbage and aids specially as a healer
[2:32:43] healhut: a lot of the rewards need to be available for just playing 3s
[2:32:54] healhut: need incentive for normal people to que
[2:33:14] Arsinalx: just remove shuffle LUL
[2:33:22] littledealerxxx: arena is also really hard to learn… even for people that are really good at their class… they need to somehow ease people into it more
[2:33:37] Landrysdad: I think that’s fine for 99% of the game though
[2:33:42] xiliketurtlex: shuffle is ALOT easier for casual because you dont have to look for a partner and stay in lfr for hours. you can find people but 90 percent of those you find in lfr will leave after 1 loss
[2:33:57] littledealerxxx: I wonder if they could have a practice mode with AI so people can practice and get more comfortable before jumping in to real PVP
[2:34:04] Landrysdad: 99% of the people playing are playing to add to the mount journal
[2:34:09] littledealerxxx: (kind of like the companion dungeons now)
[2:34:20] Devcomz: I think Ven had a great idea and just revamp LFG. It seems everyone complains about LFG and sees shuffle as an easier access point just need to make LFG just as easy
[2:34:27] shugguls: i like the fact i can get the 1800 transmog in week one before i get the normal one , so stupid
[2:35:41] littledealerxxx: if I could learn a to play healer against AI and not have people shit on me for being bad it would be easier to get in to…
[2:35:51] healhut: the top of the ladder this season will be crazy inflated i think from all the mmr "injections" earlier
[2:36:03] healhut: at the end of the season
[2:36:48] Landrysdad: that’s correct, but you’re also coming from the top 1%. In legion I was a rival no more no less
[2:37:07] Landrysdad: I never felt like ques were dead then

[2:41:09] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[2:41:40] MaybeRespect: Top is 2867. So your close
[2:41:43] MaybeRespect: !
[2:41:44] xiliketurtlex: does blizzard even talk to pvp community?
[2:42:16] Shablagoosh: do you ever run out of fury on dh mes?
[2:42:23] goatskull123: melee zug zug meta is just boring af on lower rating
[2:42:41] MaybeRespect: I feel like when MMR is above 3k it's a bit much
[2:42:51] al_capow: we have quite a few epics drop
[2:43:00] al_capow: I think avg like 2 per run so far
[2:43:10] xiliketurtlex: do you try to maximize inner demon dmg when you play?
[2:43:13] goatskull123: it's jsut very high pressure for new players, mainly because the easiest classes to play rn are the most op
[2:43:16] goatskull123: wink wink DH
[2:43:36] Shablagoosh: they could go back to the old ladder where you dont get any rewards or know where you are without 3rd party tools til season ends
[2:43:52] Devcomz: That has me thinking is the only way the playerbase is happy if if the mmr and cr reachest 3k+ at the end of the season?
[2:43:52] Shablagoosh: but maybe that would make duelist like 1800 or something and be easier for people?
[2:44:10] Landrysdad: Right now there are 1335 people 2400+. I hardly played in SL, but I remember in season 2 I briefly played in season 2. when I hit 2400 I was rank like 4400
[2:44:22] honsou2: @goatskull123 yeah but a pvp game needs to be based on motivation to get better, not on enjoying not getting better
[2:44:27] goatskull123: also idk what's happening with this game esp after watching MDI yesterday where echo ran some 24 keys w/ 1 tank and 4dps
[2:44:31] xiliketurtlex: they already easier for mogs. 1800 for mogs
[2:44:46] xiliketurtlex: pretty sure it was 2100 before changes
[2:44:54] MaybeRespect: @Shablagoosh Slippery slope man. Then people will want elite/glad to be 2100. Etc. etc.
[2:44:56] goatskull123: @honsou2 pvp needs to be based on fun
[2:45:02] goatskull123: just as any other game
[2:45:11] Devcomz: I dont think making duelist 1800 will change anything tbh
[2:45:15] crusadein: no comp pvp is fun
[2:45:20] al_capow: we saw the caster dagger, melee dagger, staff, and one of the rings
[2:45:31] crusadein: @Devcomz itll make a lot of ppl on the forums mad. ppl have large egos on this game
[2:45:41] xiliketurtlex: wow pvp skillcap is too high they are so much you need to maintain and manage
[2:45:52] xiliketurtlex: that just drives people away from it
[2:45:54] Shablagoosh: @MaybeRespect it would change season to season based on participation which might alleviate the issues a bit idk
[2:45:55] honsou2: @goatskull123 and fun is the existence of a skillcap that you can work towards. its a game
[2:46:03] goatskull123: basically people above 2k should be the ones that get fun from playing pvp competitively, below that it should just be fun
[2:46:11] MaybeRespect: @goatskull123 how do you force competitive pvp game modes to have equality of outcome
[2:46:36] crusadein: @xiliketurtlex ???? wow skillcap isnt that high.  wow doesnt require a fast reaction time, high apm. all you really need to know is big offensive spells and how to trade ur defensives for them
[2:46:37] goatskull123: hmm wdym?
[2:47:03] littledealerxxx: I think they need to integrate the “mandatory” pvp addons right there is a barrier to entry…
[2:47:15] xiliketurtlex: for new player that starts wow pvp?
[2:47:21] littledealerxxx: no one wants to spend hours setting up addons just so they can play arena
[2:47:26] xiliketurtlex: it is pretty hectic
[2:47:28] honsou2: @littledealerxxx yep addons is a far worse barrier than how "hard" the game is
[2:47:33] goatskull123: you don't need addons atleast until 2k
[2:47:43] MaybeRespect: It also depends on the baseline skill level of the playerbase. Players have gotten WAY better over the years. Not sure constantly reducing requirements is the right move
[2:47:51] littledealerxxx: but not having them just makes your worse
[2:47:57] Landrysdad: Honestly though, I think the biggest issue over everything is healers poor balance. I’m 30, I’m married, I have 2 kids, and I own a business. I don’t have the time or energy to learn Rsham or rdruid.
[2:47:59] honsou2: @xiliketurtlex so?
[2:48:29] goatskull123: most people install omnibar, sarena/gladius, bigdebuffs and w/e and don't even pay attention to them, because they still focus on their rotation too much
[2:48:36] xiliketurtlex: so what? you want more players for faster queue time
[2:48:43] littledealerxxx: they either need to ton down addons or make it easier to have them setup… it’s a bigger barrier then you think. people don’t want to que at a disadvantage but they also don’t want to spend years installing and figuring them out
[2:48:49] MaybeRespect: @Landrysdad Yeah which sucks. But like with most if not all highly competitive sports/esports etc. you can't expect it to revolve around your situation
[2:48:53] xiliketurtlex: just need to be easier for ppl to approach it
[2:49:02] Landrysdad: as an Hpal, I feel like getting people that want to consistently play is much harder than it was say after the rework last season
[2:49:05] honsou2: @xiliketurtlex who says attracting soft people means there will be more people
[2:49:12] xiliketurtlex: im fine with it cause i have been playing for years
[2:49:28] xiliketurtlex: soft people huh
[2:49:35] xiliketurtlex: what are soft people
[2:49:38] crusadein: @Landrysdad hpal sucks not many ppl want to climb with it when they can just get an rdru and have treants auto heal and win
[2:49:53] Landrysdad: @mayberespect I agree, but I think most people are closer to my situation than they are to competing and making money off of the game
[2:49:53] xiliketurtlex: explain soft people bro
[2:50:17] MaybeRespect: WoW pvp just needs to slow down. And they need to draw a line in the sand for addons. Rewards should still be competitive to get. And then that's just based on the individual
[2:50:42] honsou2: @xiliketurtlex yeah your argument was that it was "Hectic" i said "so?" you said "you want more people to queue" - you are saying the demographic will grow if you attract people that cant handle the feeling of a game being hectic
[2:50:49] honsou2: thats the wrong demographic for a pvp mode in the first place
[2:50:54] MaybeRespect: @Landrysdad Yeah but, I mean the mogs/pvp mounts(not glad) are basically free. 1800 and 1100 for the mounts.
[2:51:02] goatskull123: I think the biggest problem with wow pvp is that the feedback from you attacking someone isn't immediately obvious always
[2:51:12] littledealerxxx: @mayberespect agreed 100% addon creep has made PvP more complicated and a larger barrier to entry.
[2:51:17] Devcomz: Leave the rewards as it for right now and just add additional rewards like something at 2200 or something
[2:51:28] Devcomz: that might be a good start
[2:51:29] xiliketurtlex: easier way people to approach the game has nothing to do with emotion
[2:51:48] Devcomz: Add small reward for 1500
[2:51:55] Devcomz: etc
[2:52:02] littledealerxxx: also after 1800 most people don’t bother queuing because the rewards aren’t good until 2400 which is just to far away
[2:52:05] MaybeRespect: @Devcomz We have more rewards now then ever before. It's just hard to enjoy with the pace of the game.
[2:52:28] Landrysdad: @mayberespect I 100% agree, but that creates the issue. After 1800 why keep playing. Granted I got elite last season and had glad wins (ran out of time to farm 50 bc of the business)
[2:52:40] honsou2: @littledealerxxx this is a big problem indeed, and u dont even need 1800 u need 1600. The only reason to queue between 1600 and 2400 is an enchant
[2:53:04] Devcomz: Thats why I was thinking add more rewards after 1800 and I meant 1900 in above post not 1500
[2:53:14] goatskull123: @MaybeRespect which brings me to my main point - pvp is not enjoyable for most ppl
[2:53:16] Devcomz: seems people are only incentivized by rewards
[2:53:23] MaybeRespect: @Landrysdad 2100 is a reward, even though it's small. Also, after that should be to learn and work your way to elite and beyond. Like with most competitive scenes, not everyone is a winner at all times.
[2:53:37] goatskull123: @Devcomz if that were true, why are more ppl playing solo shuff than 3s
[2:53:41] crusadein: @littledealerxxx just need to repaint glorious tyranny and readd all its particles every season for duelist enchant and ppl will easily play to duelist
[2:53:49] MaybeRespect: @goatskull123 Oh i agree. I just don't think the reward system is the main issue whatsoever.
[2:53:59] goatskull123: yep
[2:54:04] maengz92: Foxtrot
[2:54:05] goatskull123: I also agree that rewards aren't the issue
[2:54:07] honsou2: @goatskull123 because the other seasons it was far easier to get rewards in shuffle
[2:54:16] Devcomz: @goatskull123 Rewards are easier to get in shuffle since up to 2400 it shares the same rewards as 2s and 3s
[2:54:19] MaybeRespect: It's the bloat/barrier to entry. Rewards are just additional and that's sadly what people hyper focus on
[2:54:20] crusadein: the reward system is 25% of the problem, its mostly just that pvp does not feel good at all. you have poor and slow class balancing
[2:54:28] goatskull123: You only got good rewards in shuffle in s1

[2:54:32] littledealerxxx: shuffle is also just more chill and less epectations from your team mates
[2:54:48] MaybeRespect: @goatskull123 It's the same now no?
[2:54:51] littledealerxxx: half the reason I don’t like lfg is running into toxic team mayes
[2:55:04] goatskull123: no glad mount iirc
[2:55:12] littledealerxxx: at least in shuffle if someone is an ass I just have to deal with them for a small amount of time
[2:55:32] Devcomz: The only thing 3s gives reward wise that is different from shuffle is glad but the majority dont reach glad so for them they just can get it easier in shuffle what they normally get anyway
[2:55:49] MaybeRespect: I will say, S1 Shuffle inflation was the biggest fuck up for the pvp scene. Now 1800 players are expecting to be 2700 every season and get the elite rewards which honestly is unreasonable.
[2:56:35] Landrysdad: @mayberespect I agree not everybody is a winner every time, but when I’ve been 2400+ multiple expacs and seasons. Right now I rarely play because people who aren’t my friends won’t play with an Hpal
[2:56:40] MaybeRespect: @goatskull123 Glad mount was never from shuffle irrc?
[2:56:43] dawsonator171: I'm really sad that live by the glaive doesn't do shit.
[2:56:57] dawsonator171: tried it out in a FW double warr lobby
[2:57:01] dawsonator171: and it's trash.
[2:57:06] Devcomz: yeah shuffle never had a glad mount. It has a pendant and a title called legend but no mount
[2:57:24] MaybeRespect: @Landrysdad Yeah population / balance issue for sure.
[2:57:41] Landrysdad: I have people on my friends list I have played 2400 games with that have told me they’d play with me if I could play Rsham or Rdruid and this is at like 2k-2100 right now
[2:58:15] honsou2: @Landrysdad wait what hpal is good
[2:58:47] MaybeRespect: Maybe i'm in the minority, but I don't mind the current MMR, just took way to long to get here.
[2:59:05] Devcomz: The other reason shuffle is soaking up a lot of players is outside of the rewards being the same up to 2400 you can queue shuffle and play what you want without worrying about not being accepted
[2:59:09] Landrysdad: @honsou2 Hpal is probably 4th best healer
[2:59:40] MaybeRespect: Shuffle is amazing for those that just want the mog/illusion yeah. @Devcomz
[2:59:45] Landrysdad: Rsham/rdruid/FW all better than pally. Hpriest I think is debatable
[3:00:10] littledealerxxx: hpal is great until you have a dampen game and get fkd by mana
[3:00:23] luckydyldo: @MaybeRespect I agree with you about the mmr I dont think its that bad just the first few weeks of the season were dreadful
[3:00:48] MaybeRespect: @luckydyldo Month+ easily yeah. They should legit just start season at 3k MMR Cap and let people blast.
[3:00:59] MaybeRespect: 3k seems to be the sweet spot
[3:01:08] honsou2: @Landrysdad hpal is fine ofc people will play with an hpal and 2k lol its just the two people you played with that wont
[3:01:11] Landrysdad: @luckydyldo mana for Hpal isn’t that bad. the issue is it does negative healing
[3:01:11] Moobot: Tshirts, hoodies, and mugs available now! https://merch.streamelements.com/notmes
[3:03:08] Landrysdad: @honsou2 I mean I have 2 hpals at 2k queing dh/destro, and I for sure could climb higher. Hpal just isn’t very good compared to the big dogs
[3:03:57] MaybeRespect: @Landrysdad Try FMP/SPlay. My buddy w/ duelist XP hpal is now 2600 on 3 paladins as FMP
[3:03:59] Landrysdad: rDruids heal for way more. Rshams way better mana. Fw is just annoying
[3:04:23] honsou2: hpala is dominating at top of shuffle ladder
[3:04:51] Landrysdad: shuffle and real 3s are different beasts
[3:05:00] crusadein: @honsou2 a lot of shuffle is melee which hpal counters but in 3s where its more wizards hpal is less valuable
[3:05:16] honsou2: @crusadein low rated 3s is melee cleaves
[3:05:30] MaybeRespect: @Landrysdad True. Which then makes me think, are they going to balance around shuffle or 3s.
[3:05:56] MaybeRespect: I would assume not shuffle since it's spec based ladder.
[3:06:04] Landrysdad: I haven’t played shuffle in months. At 1 point I was bottom of the 1st page in shuffle as Hpal.
[3:06:07] crusadein: 3s, they should never balance around shuffle. 3s you build your composition with each class helping the other shuffle is just a shuffle of random
[3:06:42] MaybeRespect: @crusadein This and every1 your "competing" against is in same boat (spec)
[3:07:38] MaybeRespect: Although shuffle is a bit toxic. DKs are sitting rating after the nerfs lol. As an example
[3:07:49] crusadein: shuffle has too much to do with luck rather than skill for it to be a viable thing to balance around. you can use data from it but majority of the balancing should come from 3s
[3:07:58] Landrysdad: imo homogenization of the classes is actually a big part of it also. Now there isn’t a point to not roll the top dogs. rerolling takes no time and is greatly beneficial
[3:08:37] crusadein: @Landrysdad mhmm, look at mes long time dk. its in the gutter now hes just playing dh and wins more and is probably a whole lot less stressful to play
[3:09:21] artsskeit: try to die off stream whoever that was

[3:09:52] honsou2: DH has been busted OP the entire season so no one has needed to FOTM reroll yet
[3:11:12] MaybeRespect: Mes gave me hope when patch hit, saying it doesn't look bad/possibly a buff :( sadge
[3:11:13] crusadein: they probably just /afkd out of that match
[3:11:13] shameshady: didnt the frost dk team qualify for gauntlet ? @notmes
[3:11:18] MaybeRespect: <3
[3:11:43] honsou2: @shameshady they lost every round of awc
[3:11:44] trollmasta66: Mess, you are just not allowed to stream DK anymore. Ya keep getting it nurfed
[3:11:45] littledealerxxx: *opens notes sees DK buffs, scrolls down reads the world Blood, slams laptop shut*
[3:11:51] crusadein: going to be real sad if there arent any patch notes today
[3:12:06] shugguls: 100%
[3:12:14] MaybeRespect: yeah why not man. Make AWC wild
[3:12:20] honsou2: just nerf rogue and DH i have no more expectations
[3:12:21] shugguls: i want to play my war again not a dh
[3:13:06] crusadein: unholy dk cooldown reduction upon bursting wounds when blizz???
[3:13:31] littledealerxxx: are casters relatively balanced atm? seems like lock is really strong but idk
[3:13:41] Idgtst: they really just need to delete festering wounds, just such an awkward ability
[3:13:49] shugguls: the gap between A tier and S tier has been huge lately
[3:14:00] crusadein: lock is an outlier and there a few weak ones but they're "fairly" even
[3:14:11] Landrysdad: I really wish they’d delete melee wings. Then change the light of dawn talent to make judgement an AOE heal similar to like it does during melee wings
[3:14:54] crusadein: @Idgtst i doubt that will happen even with a vast majority of dk players hating it. Idk why they swapped from the disease system getting bonus dmg per disease on the target its so simple and easy and they just made it pimple popping poor mans combo points
[3:15:10] honsou2: feelsawfulman
[3:15:12] Landrysdad: Or make a talent that allows you to judge a teammate to put a sacred shield on them
[3:15:26] crusadein: @Landrysdad really? melee wings was one of the things that made me want to play hpal.
[3:15:43] shugguls: if they nurf rogue dh do u have a back up comp?
[3:15:44] crusadein: feels weird being in plate and a shield just to sit in the back and spam shocks and flashs
[3:17:17] crusadein: elemental boomy
[3:17:22] Grimmlord009: buff dks
[3:17:55] Landrysdad: @crusadein I really enjoy it, but the problem is it has a ridiculous mana cost and forces you to position weird. It’ll never be viable because of how built the class is around holyshock/glimmer
[3:19:00] Idgtst: am i wrong for thinking sod arenas would be kind of fun?
[3:19:20] honsou2: @Idgtst fun for like a day maybe yeah
[3:19:25] Landrysdad: @crusadein I feel like the current greater judgement could be fine if it did anything. 20k damage and a 50-60k absorb on 300k damage is basically useless
[3:19:48] Landrysdad: @idgtst I think with the runes they could make it a lot of fun tbh
[3:20:33] honsou2: vanilla class design is bad and runes make the bad class designs extremely spikey OP. Its definitely not gonna be good arenas. Fun maybe
[3:20:42] crusadein: @Idgtst classic pvp requires 10v10 to be decent

[3:26:08] shugguls: blur needs to be 1.5 min
[3:27:07] MaybeRespect: @notmes Nobody cares about damage or DR unless they can see it in details. They removed spellwarding but DH passively reduces magic MORE than spellwarden did.
[3:28:17] dawsonator171: mes. do you need a healer for that DH?
[3:28:22] Idgtst: if dks had 12% spell damage reduction that shit would have a 66% nerf by week end
[3:28:23] honsou2: dk class design was so cool on launch. Turning into livelords on low hp. Then they said "nah fam back to SL" and gutted them

[3:43:48] happyheals: lol
[3:43:53] blightclub: Realistically I would buff every healer other than rsham/dru. Would tune down rogues and DKs and buff warriors
[3:44:01] Drathimos: buff dh
[3:44:01] BlueStorm91: nerf warlock survivability

[4:00:43] Zartirian: Cannot believe DH hasnt been nuked... playrates are so insane atm
[4:01:21] Anhak: i like when the game felt less scripted in like cata and mop where pressure comps rather then just gos but maybe that knowledge of the game would make that happen even then
[4:01:25] dawsonator171: allegedly feral has a really high win rate in shuffle, but it's the most stressful thing to play and survive on.

[4:05:59] al_capow: like there should be no ilvl in pvp, just have standard kits
[4:06:04] Landrysdad: Rerolling has become so easy because of it that there isn’t a reason to not just play what’s the absolute best
[4:06:05] al_capow: and have alterantive rewards

[4:08:20] Shablagoosh: ret in the rework?

[4:13:58] Drathimos: if they ban it theyll have to incorporate it into the ui
[4:14:06] Drathimos: cuz default ui is dog
[4:14:32] AntTheRogue: it would be funny having to back to using stopwatch macros for dr tracking lol
[4:14:55] Idgtst: also feels like you can put the lid back on addons, they just make the game feel better
[4:15:25] Shablagoosh: arms is pretty ethical
[4:16:00] Idgtst: is survival hunter toxic?
[4:16:01] Landrysdad: Hpal is the poster child for ethical. We are the most honorable group
[4:16:24] Landrysdad: Hpal is dog shit
[4:16:25] Mcnubex: locks and spriests are really toxic rn
[4:16:33] Landrysdad: but honorable and ethical none the less
[4:16:34] Mcnubex: with the armor buffs, locks and sp are unkillable
[4:17:08] flapjack1010: damn just started playing reatil again with pvp focus  this seems pretty relevant for me
[4:17:52] Landrysdad: make Hpal great again
[4:17:59] TiltTeamGG: 2020Snacking
[4:18:27] easybola: VoHiYo
[4:18:34] Mcnubex: idk, shuffle has definitely turned pple more toxic
[4:18:42] Shablagoosh: kinda sus scrolling twitter replies for a video while hes live ngl lol
[4:18:45] Mcnubex: when you are 2400 rating and have a 2k healer doing random shit making you lose
[4:18:52] al_capow: I do feel like performance rating though can make competitive gameplay less toxic right?
[4:19:14] al_capow: like bad players having less impact on rating kind of makes it ok
[4:19:45] Hikamiro: am i ever supposed to cast icefury as an ele shaman?
[4:20:09] wowsuomi: Its just clickbbait
[4:20:50] Mcnubex: @Hikamiro ofc you do, you get instant earth shock and can spread 2 flame shocks and get your burst going
[4:22:15] wowsuomi: The game wont be out until the end of the year what do these guys know at this point in time
[4:22:26] whspe: what are class skins anyway?
[4:23:46] Swaggerhound0: kinda like vampires
[4:23:50] whspe: oh kinda like getting a pseudo race change
[4:23:52] Idgtst: @wowsuomi they gotta milk stuff until it's dry or they run out of content
[4:23:55] whspe: with your new hero spec
[4:24:09] wowsuomi: Yeah true
[4:24:18] TheBackstabi: It's a few themed buttons instead of a complete retheme

[4:24:54] whspe: it seems like youre kind of just getting some passives and an augmented skill
[4:25:20] wowsuomi: I think this next xpac will be better then DF

[4:25:31] Idgtst: the frostfire one looked pretty fun with frostfire bolt
[4:26:03] wowsuomi: I Like the idea of a 3 part series if he story is good
[4:27:18] Idgtst: did they ever release new info about the secret patch that's coming out soonish?
[4:27:52] Landrysdad: which is the holy/ret one
[4:28:16] wowsuomi: Pretty sure it'll be the patch right before season ending
[4:29:10] Kymagez: he is after your WA's Mes monkaS
[4:29:20] loveshock7: im of the those guys who copy paste from others and just play xD
[4:29:21] TheBackstabi: The game can be less sweaty; the question is the players
[4:29:35] Shablagoosh: ban weakauras as a whole i think
[4:29:38] shoeloopz: i feel like if the game wants to be a more popular mmo again it has to prune spells hard. But i would kinda hate not having 3 bars full of spells
[4:29:40] Idgtst: they have to pay people to be like fulltime WA for rwf
[4:30:03] Shablagoosh: yea liquid has 2 people whos entire salary is to make weakauras
[4:30:05] Kymagez: ive been doing a no macro addon wa etc ss thing for my casual ass , i cant get over 1500 lol
[4:30:05] Shablagoosh: year round
[4:30:37] wowsuomi: Yeah i was gonna say that last night, it would put ppl outa there wa jobs
[4:30:41] StreetBlades: I really don't like the WA meta. I use them myself ofc, since everybody is, but I would be happy if tomorrow they say "no more WA for pvp"
[4:31:07] loveshock7: i've never used WA and i never will
[4:31:10] Kymagez: @StreetBlades  suss
[4:31:25] JimmyBigmoney: man BC UI was so ugly, tracking everything
[4:31:26] uninstallspeedrun: @loveshock7 who asked
[4:31:29] wowsuomi: Its never not been the meta
[4:31:39] Kymagez: i tried mes WA and he wouldnt stop honking at me :(
[4:32:10] TheBackstabi: DansGame
[4:32:17] wowsuomi: Some purrple dragon fight
[4:32:18] Kymagez: but tbh macros are also ...
[4:32:22] TheBackstabi: That fuckin beep made me jump lmao
[4:32:31] Swaggerhound0: god I love that res
[4:32:39] Landrysdad: My PC was way to shitty back then to raid let alone raid with this many addons
[4:32:53] Kymagez: lol
[4:33:18] whspe: okay this is wild LOL
[4:33:36] whspe: good hting he has his mount in the middle of the screen xD
[4:33:58] Kymagez: cheaters...
[4:34:05] Drathimos: asmon has just become a retail hater
[4:34:08] Shablagoosh: Adge
[4:34:11] Drathimos: he's squeezing out any take to shit on it
[4:34:32] Shablagoosh: my retail ui i use classicui lol
[4:34:44] Idgtst: i think the biggest difference is that content has just gotten way harder and complicated
[4:34:50] uninstallspeedrun: this was just a really weak take from asmon
[4:34:58] crusadein: People complain classic is too easy people complain retail is too complicated you cant ever win
[4:35:18] Shablagoosh: @crusadein and the version in the middle, wrath, is dead lol
[4:35:20] Kymagez: it shouold be built in game imo
[4:35:26] Kymagez: should*
[4:36:05] crusadein: waiting impatiently for rider of apoc
[4:36:31] Landrysdad: I think the difference is back then you weren’t required, where as now there is so much going on it’s basically a requirement
[4:36:42] Shablagoosh: o7
[4:37:11] Kymagez: well thats different
[4:37:17] crusadein: @Landrysdad they definitely have been doing more and more encounters surrounding Addons but they have to otherwise it just goes back to being too easy and people complain that the raids arent challenging yadda yadda
[4:37:22] Kymagez: basic ui is simple
[4:38:03] Kymagez: im not a dr but i rp 1 does that count
[4:38:04] plebcake_: @notmes did you prefer when AWC didn’t allow any addons ??
[4:38:27] Kymagez: agreed
[4:38:39] wowsuomi: Yeah that is true
[4:38:40] TheBackstabi: Base UI was based on a "grouping" concept I think is the term - if you wanted X info, you looked in Y spot
[4:38:45] crusadein: if it aint broke dont fix it
[4:39:15] wowsuomi: They prob never thought it was goning to be mmo mlg
[4:39:22] TheBackstabi: Console shooters tend to use the same idea. Info is spread out, but -specific- info is in a specific spot
[4:39:28] Kymagez: im playing with 1-= the basic ui everything etc, its simple but sucks
[4:39:30] StreamElements: Get 50% off your first Factor75 box + Free Wellness Shots for Life using my link! Two free wellness shots per order with an active subscription https://strms.net/factor75_notmes #ad
[4:40:01] Idgtst: I think you're right, but I also think once people got used to the WoW UI anything else was kind of off-putting. People hate change once they're used to something.
[4:40:16] jazrian: True, base UI is bad.  But at least back then, mechanics were incredibly simple, so the UI wasn't really a problem.  Retail on the other hand is far more complex, in both M+ and raids.
[4:40:31] Shablagoosh: ive used the classic 2006 ui my entire career
[4:40:39] Shablagoosh: i had to get an addon called classicui starting in bfa tho
[4:40:44] Kymagez: i never knew about "keybinds" in wow until mop lol]
[4:40:44] crusadein: most people back then only played a few games. you dont want a completely foreign game for game genres. FPS tend to follow the same trend. If you make it too different itll push people off because they simply arent used to it
[4:41:08] avenueone: i miss my cata ui
[4:41:34] Idgtst: I remember sodapoppin used to say he avoided addons specifically because he knew his viewers were used to default ui and it helped his viewership
[4:42:22] wowsuomi: What about trills take on uis
[4:42:33] avenueone: youtube vid
[4:42:38] wowsuomi: Idk
[4:42:48] Shablagoosh: trill uses barebones ui last i checked
[4:42:57] Idgtst: doesn't trill just use default ui+ details and stuff?
[4:43:15] Shablagoosh: he uses default + was yea
[4:43:29] Shablagoosh: same with pika pretty much
[4:43:47] wowsuomi: iM LIKE THAT ASWELL
[4:43:56] wowsuomi: Sorry caps
[4:44:39] Idgtst: idk, aug evokers were super broken/different and they went out of the way to add them
[4:44:58] crusadein: they're probably just going to be like specs just swap around
[4:45:01] crusadein: theres no way they would lock it
[4:45:04] Shablagoosh: surely they wouldnt make the covenant mistake again
[4:45:09] avenueone: are u feeling any better
[4:45:10] walozdle: i dont think they've said either way right?
[4:45:12] Idgtst: no chance they make you keep your choice after covenants
[4:45:26] Zugardad: they said, you could change freely
[4:45:26] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[4:45:29] avenueone: had anything w electrolytes?
[4:45:42] Yoskexz: i cant believe theres no dragon knight :(
[4:46:31] crusadein: they need to make the anti-augment. give a class thats low dps and just a huge debuffer.
[4:46:34] ellithepuppet: Hi
[4:47:25] Shablagoosh: hes a reactor he has to do that
[4:47:27] Shablagoosh: for thumbnails
[4:48:28] Shablagoosh: hes wanted wow 2 forever
[4:48:29] Drathimos: where's the blademaster hero spec
[4:48:31] Shablagoosh: delete everything etc
[4:48:38] shoeloopz: that sucked balls
[4:48:43] crusadein: but what would be the difference between wow 2 and wow
[4:48:52] avenueone: isnt this just specs renamed
[4:49:19] sunileif: theres nothing "hero" about dark ranger tree
[4:49:27] Shablagoosh: i was a big asmon stan from wod thru bfa, hes wanted the game completely wiped, lose all mounts mogs characters etc and we all start over in a modern game but its impossible
[4:49:45] shoeloopz: yeh thats a good idea
[4:50:16] shoeloopz: also this is a side note but redesign demo and BM hunter pets cuz its a lot of clutter even for senior playrs
[4:50:18] injos: PoE talent tree in wow. That would be interesting (obfuscation).
[4:50:21] crusadein: @Shablagoosh theres nothing wow 2 would do different from wow 1. you have the same developers, same shareholders. They just need to do an expansion revamp
[4:50:21] TheBackstabi: Aint that just SoD in another form
[4:51:15] Empatiae: that can work in a new game, not in an old one
[4:51:18] avenueone: rogues would be fine if there was a chance they stunned themselves
[4:51:20] gandyAU: hey whoa whoa lets not call out mage zoomies
[4:51:53] Applezbtw: u mean i have to think about my actions ? PowerUpL SMOrc PowerUpR
[4:52:21] Kolowavex: rich!
[4:52:35] Kolowavex: I just got a huge promotion at work!!!
[4:52:55] crusadein: what are DKs and DHs going to be called now that there are hero specs. would they still be hero classes?
[4:53:23] crusadein: hasnt, its just flair
[4:53:36] injos: I think a big problem in wow is that something that's fun in pve isn't fun to play against. PvE vs PvP doesn't match. The more fun it is to play, the more frustrating it is to play against.
[4:53:36] Kymagez: @Kolowavex can i get a small loan ?
[4:53:43] Shablagoosh: both dhs hero talents names sound really boring
[4:53:47] Shablagoosh: random side note lol
[4:53:50] teimos42: hero just meant that its a reference to the hero unit from warcraft 3
[4:54:25] whspe: I would love to live in that world, of class drawbacks
[4:54:26] injos: That's really good for PVP agreee. But hard to sell for PVE.

[4:54:36] whspe: it’s pretty good skill expression
[4:55:04] crusadein: @injos it can lessen the pve mechanics, now that people have to use things sparingly they might lessen up on all the goofy mechanics
[4:55:28] whspe: if a lock fears too much
[4:56:07] crusadein: gotta make a private server add it and see how people recieve it ez pz
[4:56:11] Kymagez: rogues having points on ppl not just total
[4:56:16] Kymagez: was good
[4:56:46] Shablagoosh: i mean he says that but i see him in valdrakken going to mythic plus kinda often lol
[4:57:07] gandyAU: ive just come back to retail and i have no fucking clue about the new profession system lol
[4:57:17] Shablagoosh: I genuinely think hes outgrown it
[4:57:26] teimos42: hes just perma burnt out
[4:57:34] sunileif: nah other people always ruin everything
[4:57:45] crusadein: hasnt he just become a mostly reaction streamer and then just reupload those to youtube.
[4:57:50] Shablagoosh: thats why he quit ff14 right?
[4:57:53] sunileif: its that human desire to force others to comiserate with them
[4:58:01] BobbyVex: i think his community prevents him from enjoying alot of things. probably why he doesnt stream on his main anymore
[4:58:08] crusadein: @teimos42 doesnt help when you have a chat of 10000 backseat gaming and ocmplaining youre playing X game
[4:58:19] Zonnis: i think all his negative talk about   wow turned his community against it so now he cant enjoy it either
[4:58:19] avenueone: to me these hero specs just look like the same specs renamed in a thesaurus
[4:58:27] iamonemanonamission: He can't. Everyone critizies anything he does. Your right it's pretty much off stream or bust. He gets harrased non-stop with any mmo he plays.
[4:58:38] memil141: he sems so angry no a days
[4:58:43] Idgtst: He also kind of made a community off of shitting on WoW. That's what his viewers came there for.
[4:58:44] memil141: now a days
[4:58:48] crusadein: @avenueone yeah, its just revamped names really
[4:58:53] memil141: but love him
[4:59:03] Shablagoosh: mes, we want you to hate dhs
[4:59:17] crusadein: oooooo mes wants to hate dhs ooooooooo
[5:00:10] sunileif: hero specs gonna get scrapped NODDERS
[5:00:38] crusadein: seems like it.
[5:02:06] Shablagoosh: id like a gameplay change
[5:02:12] crusadein: would want power attached to it, already got transmog
[5:02:28] Zonnis: I would prefer it be how I play it, and build a mog to go with it
[5:02:29] sunileif: id like some rock papper elements added to pvp
[5:02:41] johnnythunderbunny: 2 fucks though?
[5:02:50] Swaggerhound0: Swaggerhound0 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! (:

[5:02:55] johnnythunderbunny: yo i've been lurking for hours
[5:02:56] avenueone: mes swearing alot are u ok mes?
[5:02:57] johnnythunderbunny: late
[5:03:00] BobbyVex: i think there needs to be alittle flavoer
[5:03:02] BobbyVex: flavor
[5:03:05] avenueone: usually we just get 1 an hour not 5 a minute
[5:03:07] johnnythunderbunny: listening to why i hate this game
[5:03:37] Zonnis: I hope they figure out a place for Augvokers, I really enjoy the bard style classes
[5:03:47] Empatiae: If an expansion allows me to be a Dark Ranger, it HAS to have power tied to it.
[5:03:55] johnnythunderbunny: ravendawn
[5:04:04] johnnythunderbunny: sandbox pvp game that looks like tibia
[5:04:16] Shablagoosh: that new diablo clone game comes out in a few days
[5:04:19] Shablagoosh: could be fun
[5:04:29] johnnythunderbunny: like a month ago
[5:04:32] sunileif: jokes on you all danger ranger is is black arrow returning
[5:04:36] Empatiae: like getting artifact weapons for my DH in Legion was great experience, because there was so much power attached to them.
[5:04:44] Jigidog: @notmes Hey mes, i whisped you a question a few days ago, is it possible to get an answer? Just so if i can move on if needed <3
[5:04:45] kywozen: Ravendawn is cool
[5:04:48] johnnythunderbunny: no
[5:04:55] johnnythunderbunny: it's basically archeage minus pay to win
[5:05:03] johnnythunderbunny: with the weird graphics

[5:06:32] johnnythunderbunny: i've also been sick the past few days
[5:06:50] Shablagoosh: yea dew was bored as heck lol
[5:07:00] johnnythunderbunny: did you eat the same thing that fucked you up
[5:07:14] avenueone: probably gastro from the kid
[5:07:30] johnnythunderbunny: my nieces are walking plague carriers
[5:07:36] johnnythunderbunny: so i get it
[5:07:48] sunileif: virus mutated
[5:07:53] avenueone: different strains lol
[5:08:14] sunileif: sounds like dysentry
[5:09:11] avenueone: he usually pulls their chat out and makes em reply or bans them infront of every1

[5:10:03] jamesxqp: he literally gets trolled all the time
[5:10:21] teimos42: wasnt he gona become a lawyer or something
[5:10:39] sunileif: his rhetoric would make hima  lawyer
[5:10:46] hateorade52: he doesn’t like people or public places
[5:11:03] hateorade52: super anti social
[5:12:29] crusadein: whats the difference between class skins and me just wearing a red fire transmog set
[5:12:40] crusadein: if the abilities dont differ its just a fancier version of transmog
[5:13:09] teimos42: cuz its to change ability artwork not mogs
[5:13:18] hateorade52: that’s his words just got done watching his stream and him talking about helldivers is made for group players and he doesn’t know if it’s for him. not trying to knock him
[5:13:28] johnnythunderbunny: microsoft can afford fucking artists
[5:13:29] crusadein: @teimos42 they have glyphs for alot of that.
[5:13:31] johnnythunderbunny: use ai get over it
[5:13:56] sunileif: dark ranger should get vanish, kidney shot, garotte and shadow dance
[5:14:30] crusadein: i can change my anti magic shell to red blue and green using glyphs. thats all class skins are. just bigger glyphs. If i am a rider of the apocalypse I want to bring the apocalypse. i dont want just a glyph to changes it
[5:15:28] jamesxqp: so its a mog?
[5:16:28] artsskeit: arent you guys sick the last thing you need is to be staring at that horror show
[5:16:45] kawemango: old models bis models
[5:16:55] crusadein: that just seems so lame to just have a physical difference. Not having power especially tied to a HERO spec will be such a letdown
[5:17:19] crusadein: yeah its just my take against these comments from these people that wontever read my comments
[5:17:25] BobbyVex: its gonna be a covenant situation all over again.
[5:17:31] theJUDGEtr: Ima wait to play around with it before dunking on it hopefully it's cool
[5:17:53] sunileif: yes i wanna shot arrows of blood as a hunter and black fire as a mage
[5:18:56] BobbyVex: im hoping for the best but after the last few expansions i dont know
[5:18:57] sunileif: then have it so you can turn off other players spell cosmetics on your side
[5:19:41] crusadein: feels like spell screen clutter is soooo much at this point that changing colors wont do much. still going to need to use a bunch of addons so you can track whats going on
[5:20:12] Szain3: DinoDance
[5:20:19] BobbyVex: asmon is right though when he talks about there being too much. there is too much.
[5:21:26] crusadein: all it takes is one person to post a forum post saying class skins and it spreads like wildfire
[5:23:01] BasicSnake: Disabling addons would make me quit the game I think
[5:23:03] theJUDGEtr: I'd give it a go no idea how it would feel ahah
[5:23:09] crusadein: wow wont ever cease to have addons. game relies so hard on it.
[5:23:29] sunileif: just end it and bring on wow2
[5:23:49] sunileif: already got your vanilla andys
[5:23:57] crusadein: damage meters!!!!!! yippy!
[5:23:57] sunileif: player base is already split
[5:24:05] iamonemanonamission: If it makes blizz upgrade the existing UI and in game tools to be better. It's worth imo.

[5:24:49] sunileif: vanilla and BC and wrath and cata servers arent torching the game?
[5:24:50] ooomeee: why is his cam frozen?
[5:25:04] crusadein: @ooomeee video paused
[5:25:04] injos: addons is a good way to  reduce dev time and put it on the players. I would say it's a win win. Company likes it, most players like it.
[5:25:24] zatoichisanx: mes is the streamer with the golden voice
[5:25:28] luckydyldo: I haven't seen a good reason to why disabling addons helps the game
[5:25:35] crusadein: probably a forum post once a week wanting addons removed
[5:26:17] Spawrro: yea thats def true, I hear a noise I pop a cd, it helps when I play about twice a week
[5:26:17] Moobot: Join my Discord community! https://discord.gg/mes
[5:26:20] sunileif: ya but its 20 years of a game cant expect new players to notice everything
[5:26:23] crusadein: @luckydyldo forces blizzard to upgrade the base ui. Changes a lot of mechanics that blizzard adds that relies on addons. Changes the whole pvp dynamic now that you dont have a horn going off in ur ear letting you know big dmg is coming.
[5:26:25] jamesxqp: can you use addons in competitions ?
[5:27:45] injos: Maybie they shouldn't cater the raids towards WFR. But we have HC / normal / lfr. So I don't see why ppl are upset about mythic difficulty.
[5:28:03] crusadein: changes from a passion project to a commitment
[5:28:07] luckydyldo: @crusadein so if you disable the addons how are the new playes supposed to know damage is coming, theyre just going to get 1 shot
[5:29:13] crusadein: @luckydyldo youd have to enchance certain spell visuals + same way you learn mechanics in raids. wipes. youre going to lose and if you arent fine with losing you arent going to get better.
[5:30:31] crusadein: like the different between an ele shaman and a ret paladin. ele shamans big damage isnt as  large of a visual as rets. You see rets big ol wings pop and oyu know to trade ele just pops and dumps you. Gotta give them a large visual to show
[5:30:58] injos: So many progress kills where we couldn't kill the boss until ppl dialed down the dps race and doing mechanics. Can't remember last time we whiped due to enrage timer. Always ppl not doing mechanics
[5:31:10] Spawrro: that isn't the best argument, mechanics still matter, the point is you have to do the most dmg while doing the mechanics
[5:31:50] luckydyldo: @crusadein I agree but i feel like addons are already that answer I can look at details and learn what just 1 shot me and try and prevent it. Why would blizzard take the time to develop all that into the game when its already there
[5:31:56] BobbyVex: i like to parse but only because its a good way to know if youre playing your class correctly.
[5:32:04] crusadein: The one boss in BFD with the totems. So many people just wanted to get BIGdmg. and not doing the actual mechanics
[5:32:09] injos: But mechanics still should have prio. But a lot of players do DPS >>> mechanics. And rather whipe if they don't get the dps and go again.
[5:32:12] sunileif: used to be just rogue players that stroked their dps
[5:32:24] luckydyldo: @crusadein I just think blizzard wouldnt care to do it mainly
[5:32:46] avenueone: mes used to stroke his dps on mage on sinestra
[5:32:57] crusadein: @luckydyldo So that new player doesnt have to outsource to a third party, figure how to download addons. Download curseforge and overwolf, search addon download addon setup addon. Instead its just setup which dmg is already setup in the chat logs, just a ugly variation
[5:33:47] Kida_tanaka: watch recent cup win ?
[5:34:11] luckydyldo: @crusadein that fair i just dont see it happening
[5:34:15] Shablagoosh: watch some dh awc games or something lol
[5:34:18] avenueone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXyDqyxRifY&t
[5:34:21] Spawrro: yea blizz should try to implement some addons as core, but they would likely mess it up and then ppl would use the addons anyway
[5:34:46] avenueone: its not a troll
[5:34:47] crusadein: @luckydyldo me neither, thats why a lot of people want addons banned. Blizzard has become to reliant on fans to fix their mistakes when it should just be default with the game.
[5:35:06] avenueone: its abit bias towards classic
[5:35:20] wooglesworth: im thinking about getting back into retail as ele sham, could i get fully geared just doing bgs or do i have to do arenas for conquest still? and how long does it take to get max level now?
[5:35:30] avenueone: sure
[5:35:39] crusadein: get like 20 conq after the first win
[5:35:51] crusadein: just yolo rbgs
[5:35:52] sunileif: 489'd a mage in a week w/o arena
[5:36:02] Swaggerhound0: this video is so good
[5:36:07] Spawrro: @wooglesworth yea you can, you would get quicker conquest with arena tho, with bgs you would probably get a new piece every 2-3 days
[5:36:08] sunileif: maybe 2 weeks
[5:36:09] wooglesworth: @sunileif is that max IL for pvp?
[5:36:18] sunileif: ya
[5:36:58] sunileif: i have 3 489 pvp and i barely do arena
