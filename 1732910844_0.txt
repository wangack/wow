[2:53:20] Targanis: i mean if gul'dan and cenarius came back for legion then azshara can too right?
[2:53:31] KaisenSiru: anniesRIP
[2:54:14] faulen: no key
[2:55:35] faulen: looks like a path leads to him
[2:55:55] raldrik: this is where dragon riding gets annoying and old school flying shines
[2:56:07] faulen: on the map
[2:56:39] thebakeriscomingforu: hmm, didn't Azshara mention something about a "vacant throne" or something before she left?
[2:57:05] agg_ie: or maybe the disc up at the top has to be activated somehow?

[3:00:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Someone mentioned it before, and it is kind of creepy how streamers of Hogwarts get their avatars in game to look way too much like them
[3:00:53] Molvonos: Why does it matter?
[3:01:07] EdgeOfTwilight: how it ptr ret?
[3:01:29] Brett_07: What Aura do you use for Ret?
[3:01:29] geokouts: maybe early March?

[3:02:07] geokouts: please people here dont get the bair of Howards legacy...
[3:02:15] geokouts: bait
[3:02:16] 91Niki: @wEiRdO_dUdE A lot of people who play games like that make their character look like themselves? Not just streamers
[3:02:17] Ckraigfriend: have you seen the new grind for the reputation for the winterpelt
[3:02:18] Molvonos: People are allowed to talk about the game.
[3:02:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: @wEiRdO_dUdE watch it happen sometime and you'll do a double take
[3:02:39] Molvonos: However, if people start getting into the politics or bullshit, it'll get quashed quickly.
[3:02:39] SC0REGASMS: is there a vendor to buy BOA gear from all that dust you're getting?
[3:02:52] thebakeriscomingforu: @91Niki must have been reading different reviews and watching different gameplay. If it is what you want, have fun. towBeer

[3:04:11] FranciscoTheMage: NOOOO dominaton SHARDS??
[3:04:14] FranciscoTheMage: not again pls
[3:04:21] Molvonos: It's not the same.
[3:04:31] akia03: wouldnt the gems have to be op to counter the loss of all the stats?
[3:04:39] FranciscoTheMage: god why would they even use that term
[3:04:41] faulen: can you only go in multiple times a day?
[3:04:45] FranciscoTheMage: it brings back such bad memories
[3:05:00] Aquadriel: and morons calling the vault a new thorgast lol
[3:05:20] ripperofbong420: whats your ilvl on this character
[3:05:22] emznev: shadowlands was never a thing :)
[3:05:29] mandalakoala: so whats the point of the vault?
[3:05:47] RAF_Sean: Surely you're wrong Towelliee, my entire raid team is in a shambles over the thought of new Dom Shards - Based on their research of *checks notes* Reading a single headline

[3:06:14] AlphasaurusRexx: @thebakeriscomingforu I been watching Lirik do his playthrough. The game looks pretty fun imo

[3:06:22] Buckwink: dom shards are the worst system to have ever been introduced
[3:06:23] emznev: @FranciscoTheMage LUL
[3:06:27] FranciscoTheMage: is Blizzard trolling us by naming these things Domination
[3:06:28] mattmanbrah: Did ret get more movement buttons?
[3:06:34] FranciscoTheMage: theyhave a sick sense of humor
[3:06:41] akia03: so you use the gems to upgrade them?
[3:07:05] Molvonos: Considering the Cobalt ring, with it's proc, was far and above better than everything up until later heroic raid/higher ilvl key rings because of the proc, it miht be worth it
[3:07:06] 91Niki: @AlphasaurusRexx Oh nice :D Yeah I am having a ton of fun. If you're into those open world rpg style games, and like magic. It's a ton of fun!
[3:07:24] MaySaveYou: Well, if itâs based on our RNG I might as well not even go. My RNG is horrible on most of my turn one
[3:07:29] LoLoLOllol123: oh gosh... its torghast... ahhhhhhhhhhh
[3:07:41] Molvonos: No its not
[3:07:47] AlphasaurusRexx: @91Niki i love rpg games that dont seem endless. This looks like an awesome game to 100% on
[3:07:57] FranciscoTheMage: i liked torghast
[3:07:59] 91Niki: @91Niki For sure!!
[3:08:03] FranciscoTheMage: it was hella fun to me
[3:08:06] Incredible_Sausage: is there a fail state where you can brick everything and get nothing?
[3:08:15] FranciscoTheMage: also i wasnt trying to run a million levels in one sitting
[3:09:19] Traulk: could you have killed that elemental in the fire room?
[3:09:34] 91Niki: @AlphasaurusRexx I got 10 hours on it already, and I am just taking my sweet time doing secrets, a bit of side quests and such :D

[3:10:18] geokouts: tank gem
[3:10:22] bartholimu: what the fuck
[3:10:54] PvtHudson093: is it me are you really slow

[3:11:09] emznev: he slow lol
[3:11:13] emznev: drunk
[3:11:25] geokouts: go to the fire room
[3:11:27] 91Niki: @91Niki Never played Fable. So can't say. I often tend to get lost in open world games. Distracted on side quests and stuff, which makes me lose interest cuz it becomes overwhelming with so much to do. This game doesn't give me that feeling, which is great!
[3:11:27] Sayryn: Blizzard promised "Spicy combinations"
[3:11:47] id_invaded__: Can you do this in group?
[3:12:01] shortyforthewin: totaly a new game now or with flying and so on seems so much new mechanic

[3:12:34] Faregon: what are those stuff ilvl 411 ? is smth we gotta farm ? or doesnt do much for raids m+?
[3:12:36] FranciscoTheMage: maybe its not for mythic raiders
[3:13:25] AlphasaurusRexx: @91Niki Fable is probably my favorite console RPG. It has linear story progression with side quests/activities to do. Very similar structure to HP. I too get overwhelmed with RPGs like Fallout where I spend too much time being a packrat and no time doing story quests
[3:13:40] c0mmander_starscream: Lost Ark vibes
[3:13:41] snake_like: that part I do not like
[3:13:58] rodimusprime085: how do you 418 farm?
[3:14:00] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee you can also upgrade the gems btw. the ilvl of that ring will go up to 424. with 3 effects i WILL BE BIS for some classes easily
[3:14:02] faulen: is there a mega dungeon on the island?
[3:14:06] Mecabeast: I'd just keep a 2nd ring to slot all the protection gems into
[3:14:06] Molvonos: You can also smash them for fragments that JCs can craft into a 'random gem family' gem
[3:14:09] Brett_07: Gems are destroyed if replaced?
[3:14:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: yeah i remember not caring about love rocket because lost ark was out

[3:21:03] ZeusDNA: @bartholimu You know, you could have read the title to see he's doing 10.0.7 PTR. :)
[3:21:05] Molvonos: I definitely will open that vault in one day

[3:23:26] FrankTizzle: really?
[3:23:30] Molvonos: You can actually upgrade the gems, so you're not completely finished, since you can use gems you cant use, smash them, and use the shards/fragments to upgrade your gems.
[3:23:33] akia03: https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-explains-the-primordial-stones-system-in-patch-10-0-7-331388

[3:23:52] Valzark: on the blue post is said they goto 424 the gems
[3:23:56] Molvonos: JCs needed more money
[3:23:58] Thoriakk: the upgrades will put the ring at 424
[3:23:59] Blared44: you trade the fragments
[3:24:01] Molvonos: So Blizz was like, here.
[3:24:02] akia03: jewelcrafters
[3:24:06] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee that ring will be upgradeable to 424
[3:24:08] VanishSHRoguE: it will be bis
[3:24:13] ZeusDNA: lmao JC just didn't get enough money from lariat

[4:04:13] tawney_owl_: i hate how hard it is for me to get explosives as a sin rogue, if i waste a mutilate to destroy explosives it doesnt refund any energy so i go barren and cant dps for a few seconds
[4:04:22] dreamwalker213: I hope heâs a Chad, boss isnât that boss on fort anymore

[4:05:27] CEK_kingdom: @Dcarter yeah true, im just saying healer should be wanting to do that job because that fight doesnt require very much healing

[5:27:07] cynical_j0k3r: I canât stand tht shit
[5:27:13] Tyfon7: chat wants to grind themselves to death, get everything, then complain there's nothing to do
[5:27:13] Subbed_No_Ban: But you need 2400 rating to get items high
[5:27:22] bootscalp: It shouldnt be about what blizzard doesnt want it should be what feels best to the players
[5:27:34] cynical_j0k3r: Yeah but you can pay for carry
[5:27:39] cynical_j0k3r: Thatâs why
[5:27:45] xghostyyx: Just lower the valor earned on a scale and you know what if they run 500 2's they deserve to be heroic geared
[5:27:51] bootscalp: How would that feel good?
[5:27:52] Tyfon7: what feels best to players and best you, @bootscalp, aren't necessarily the same
[5:27:56] heltvild: you only need like 2k to upgrade to 411 so with uncapped valor you would farm up to 411 very quick and then 2400 is easy with that itemlevel
[5:27:56] Zeke_nl: i love i can ding 70 and get right into getting gear
[5:27:57] kappaday23: Keepo
[5:28:13] bootscalp: Players want to acomplish things not sit around waiting till next week to see an upgrade
[5:28:14] temp3st98: mmo players today are really lazy
[5:28:14] shimwood: TLPD on a 5 minute guaranteed respawn timer is what's best for players
[5:28:18] cynical_j0k3r: They want the first month or so to be difficult
[5:28:18] xLink_tv: if they can keep you in the game longer by timegating all the powerboost why wouldnt they? youd end up gearing in a week and noping out after 3 and their stats would be wrecked
[5:28:26] kreloril777: thx for the run
[5:28:31] cynical_j0k3r: They donât want people to be able to spam.
[5:28:31] TheItalianStallion321: holy shit the Nets are imploding. they just traded Jae Crowder for 5 2nd rd picks
[5:28:32] aesirsghost: If there aren't weekly gates, we get everything week 1, get bored, unsub. How is that fun for you or Blizz?
[5:28:33] stonyman187: yeah I gotta say I am enjoying the game since quitting during TBC. Maybe find some peeps you like and can play with I find that makes a huge difference.
[5:28:38] Masqerader: nice broodkeeper dagger for my rogue from 4 mythics weekly
[5:28:46] SundanceC: They dont want you to unsub and play something else.
[5:28:47] ZeusDNA: I love people that state their opinion and then say that's the opinion of everyone KEKW
[5:28:48] bootscalp: Maybe blizzard should make more shit for people to do instead of worrying about how fast people consume their content
[5:28:50] Raxxiety: it doesnt matter what they do, the playerbase will always complain
[5:28:53] neverbornlucky: Towelliee I'll give you your free vendor gear buying but first you have to do this rep and then get this dungeon and then you need to get rep with this area and then we will give you gear but you need to upgrade it each week
[5:28:53] Griffo525: Playing the wrong game if you don't like gear progression
[5:29:02] smashwow: and that's probably one of the best times in the game
[5:29:06] aesirsghost: This guys takes lmao
[5:29:07] ZeusDNA: There's so much to do in DF
[5:29:12] stonyman187: There is a shit TON of stuff to do

[5:29:21] cynical_j0k3r: Yeah. Trust @towelliee.  There is so much
[5:29:24] xLink_tv: @bootscalp you consume 2% of the content and moan theres nothing to do xD
[5:29:28] xghostyyx: Torghast is such a great idea hope they implement it again
[5:29:28] shortyforthewin: a question they release the game but not everything working  yet ???
[5:29:30] juicefermilk: play vanilla then complain about nothing to do.. lol
[5:29:31] cynical_j0k3r: Yeah
[5:29:35] heltvild: more shit to do like brining back korthia and the maw Kappa
[5:29:38] bootscalp: Because its not fun and everything ends with a weekly gate
[5:29:42] kappaday23: UwU
[5:29:42] mordhaux: people have problems creating goals for themselves, they only ever make it about gear and nothing else
[5:29:47] Inthezonewow: towStop towIt
[5:29:49] stonyman187: LFG is super easy
[5:29:51] bootscalp: You can do that content for a week at best
[5:29:52] kreloril777: he wants p2w
[5:29:58] temp3st98: he can play ptr
[5:30:01] Tyfon7: maybe it's time for a new game
[5:30:05] bootscalp: World content
[5:30:07] juicefermilk: i personally like rep grinding, that shit takes a while lol

[5:30:47] shimwood: Run old content for TMog
[5:30:49] Subbed_No_Ban: dorkiHw
[5:30:52] bootscalp: I want more 5 mans to start with how is 8 dungeons enough for an Xpac?

[5:30:56] cynical_j0k3r: I want island expeditions
[5:30:57] MedicineMan: Glacial Spike buff (frost mage) is what i want XD
[5:30:57] zodd_amhai: is that guy FF14 player KEKW
[5:30:59] Inthezonewow: No content because it's not shit he wants to do, therefore game is shit LULW
[5:31:06] dschmidt: This is the content they want, to complain
[5:31:08] Davedaman26: money
[5:31:08] pigzip: Archaeology
[5:31:08] cynical_j0k3r: I want island expeditions. Lol.
[5:31:16] tehrobtar: @Inthezonewow precisely that
[5:31:18] neverbornlucky: towelliee be nice to them otherwise they going to go into mrgm chat and complain about what you said
[5:31:18] EpicJune: waifu sim Kappa
[5:31:22] xLink_tv: @bootscalp 8 dungs for S1, 8 more for S2
[5:31:24] Sayryn: Mage towers that give loot instead of just cosmetic
[5:31:25] LoneRangers: I feel like the content is too flooded. There is too much stuff to do it gets overwhelming.
[5:31:26] xLink_tv: they already fixed that issue
[5:31:26] Subbed_No_Ban: We want wings of liberty on ret !
[5:31:38] Tyfon7: He wants to feel the way he felt the first time he ever played WoW, and it will never happen, and he can't handle it
[5:31:41] Heero_Effect: @epicjune I would want that
[5:31:42] im_capy: Tic tac toe or ee riot
[5:31:44] Bhish: I think the WQ rewards don't scale quickly enough to your ilvl @Towelliee
[5:31:46] im_capy: we*
[5:31:50] chefdejour82: VR
[5:31:52] bootscalp: Its flooded with crap that doesnt matter
[5:31:53] mavericks312: the whole there is nothing to do is a horrible argument
[5:32:10] bootscalp: Yeah and there for its uselss right?
[5:32:18] Brett_07: Sweet
[5:32:24] smashwow: @xLink_tv not exactly. the xpac launch with 8 new dungeons. what you're referring to is the seasonal rotation re-using old dungeons. while it's different it's not new
[5:32:29] Bhish: But I'm in full Epic gear and WQ rewards are still blue
[5:32:31] juicefermilk: its good for gearing on the way up.. thats about it
[5:32:31] bootscalp: I gotta do M+ or raid content to progress just like every other Xpac
[5:32:32] firehawk73: its good for the frogs at least
[5:32:41] im_capy: There is more than enough to do, is the game catered to a single person playstyle...not a chance

[5:32:46] temp3st98: people these days want content that is meaningful so they dont  throw their lives away KEKW bro cmon its a video game
[5:32:49] mavericks312: @bootscalp go pvp
[5:32:49] Subbed_No_Ban: @firehawk73 :)
[5:32:58] aesirsghost: Blizz should obviously have 6 raids per tier and every dungeon since wow released should be able to M+.
[5:33:00] xLink_tv: @smashwow still better than keeping the same 8 dungs for the entire expansion
[5:33:03] LoneRangers: Can you not get the high ilvl infuse for crafting gear without doing high mythics?
[5:33:17] cynical_j0k3r: @temp3st98 hit it on the head
[5:33:22] seabass40: cool tell them to stop nerfing rogues lol
[5:33:22] Davedaman26: free money from blizzard towNut3
[5:33:33] tuvotastic: Let's be real if you don't want to do PVP, Mythics or raids then you have no interest in progression lol
[5:33:35] uzury: I think we need more turtles getting safe to the water
[5:33:43] neverbornlucky: Towellie I really missed borrowed powers can we get that back ?
[5:33:44] Tyrannos1: LUL
[5:33:48] fistofnature: @LoneRangers you can get one 405 for free for killing razageth and then you get a free one for every major faction you max out in renown
[5:33:52] smashwow: @smashwow eh it's a short term fix. you eventually run out of content to recycle. sooner rather than later.
[5:34:00] firehawk73: Think about the Turtles!!!@!
[5:34:01] garmin1987: i mean you can kinda get money from blizzard turn gold into account money
[5:34:03] ChaseDeMoorr: Blizz gave me a 25k deal to promote dragon flight as a brand deal
[5:34:12] ChaseDeMoorr: They can pay good if you negotiate
[5:34:14] Masqerader: #notsaved
[5:34:24] Bayne77: PUMPERS NO LEG HUMPERS
[5:34:30] abracka_: anyone in chat do the renown 19, garden of secrets quest for valdrakken accord? wanting to know if you get 2.5k renown at the end of it
[5:34:37] FosSiLiTate: Kyrie winning his first Mavs game without Luka had to give at least one guy in Brooklyn a stroke
[5:34:39] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee i agree people complain just to complain.. they already tried to make World Quests more complicated and Everyone hated it
[5:34:43] Subbed_No_Ban: @fistofnature lfr raz isnât free you pay with your soul
[5:34:48] Brett_07: Furry penthouse
[5:34:57] seabass40: New battlegrounds would be nice
[5:34:57] xLink_tv: @smashwow sure, but atm they have how many dungs in the game to reuse atm? creating new ones take a lot of time, balancing it all, where as rebalancing some older ones is like half the work right?
[5:35:03] bootscalp: World quest content that does not suck ass
[5:35:12] Lestatis: I'd like to see something like Fractals from GW2
[5:35:13] Indamoment: Ya just fill your hole
[5:35:13] SundanceC: My void is an active guild.
[5:35:16] Aquadriel: he needs a dick to fill his void KEKW
[5:35:16] shimwood: But if they add housing, what am I going to do once I've maxed out my house? LUL
[5:35:22] Tyfon7: what makes it not suck ass
[5:35:24] ChaseDeMoorr: Blizz gave me a 25k brand deal to promote dragon flight on my socials, they can pay well if you know the right people brother
[5:35:27] Masqerader: escort some BE's to goldshire inn
[5:35:38] seabass40: star wars galaxies even had housing come on blizzard Kappa
[5:35:38] NeoVLace: @Towelliee We do need/could use a better large map, kinda like the minimap.
[5:35:40] xLink_tv: tbf i much prefer'd BFA with 10 M+, 8 feels too low
[5:35:47] neverbornlucky: Towelliee I want mage tower back in dragon isle
[5:35:49] im_capy: Towelliee gonna be the new Ghostcrawler
[5:35:51] FosSiLiTate: we know every other MMO looks at WoW
[5:36:07] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @chaselotus (warning)
[5:36:09] FranciscoTheMage: they saw NEW WORLD and FF and put in their crafting system
[5:36:11] bootscalp: Relevancy is a big issue with 90% of their content
[5:36:19] Exodeo_: account wide rep
[5:36:19] Nezbane: can you do mage tower unless its timewalking?
[5:36:21] smashwow: @xLink_tv considering they're only going back to MOP because of design issues. 48-ish dungeons (that most of the player base has already seen).
[5:36:22] kreloril777: theres housing kinda
[5:36:28] EasilyZeroed: I mean we had housing in WoD kinda
[5:36:33] mavvy33: im in chat
[5:36:33] zodd_amhai: when people cry about WoW not having enough to do please go try FF11 for a few months then talk KEKW
[5:36:36] xLink_tv: the first few iterations of torghast was awesome, some challenging content with some awesome powercreep
[5:36:37] zodd_amhai: standing simulator 14
[5:36:42] Nezbane: ohhhhhh sheeeee
[5:36:46] uzury: bro a guild hall like the class hall with upgrades like garrison would be bang
[5:36:52] Gremaldy: Housing would be cool, I mean that garrison crap is still in the game so why not right???
[5:37:04] ReactionDT: I can't even find it
[5:37:05] teege6089: i think they should have a conversion of primal infusions to concentrated like a 10 to 1 or something
[5:37:06] Exodeo_: ashes ? Kappa
[5:37:06] seabass40: @zodd_amhai  all i did on ff11 was level other classes lol
[5:37:08] mozavich: i like the ship system in starwars. maybe have something like that for wow, but ship related? similar to sea of thieves
[5:37:10] Subbed_No_Ban: @bootscalp true big true
[5:37:18] Heero_Effect: why are WoW players so afraid to try new games lol
[5:37:18] Sayryn: Best Towelliee rant on content ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMF7zwsjYGU
[5:37:24] Nezbane: id heal but i cant find your grp =(
[5:37:24] Davedaman26: I wouldn't mind doing more with xmog like a bigger event than Trial of Style but that's just me.
[5:37:25] smashwow: like the recycle is something. but it's just kicking the can down the road. people want what they haven't seen before. that's what gets people excited.
[5:37:40] Masqerader: if they bring housing, I want access to all chat logs from it, because you know some penthouse letters shit going on in there
[5:37:44] seabass40: @Heero_Effect because their not any good mmos out there anymore.
[5:37:50] ReactionDT: I wonder why its not showing for me
[5:37:52] xLink_tv: @smashwow they could go back further and do what they did with HoV and rebalance stuff
[5:37:52] kreloril777: if you want housing play ff14 lol
[5:38:07] cynical_j0k3r: I forsure thought they could have put housing into last xpac. Your own personal heaven for defeating jailer.
[5:38:09] bootscalp: MMO's are dyeing because no one can figure out the formula anymore thats why everyone is going back to classic versions
[5:38:21] im_capy: They could repurpose the garrison instances
[5:38:21] warrenny: Mythic plus?
[5:38:24] mordhaux: wow: battle royale imo
[5:38:25] teege6089: THOUGHTS on a conversion of primal infusions to concentrated like a 10 to 1 or somethign like that
[5:38:27] Masqerader: @bootscalp no there not
[5:38:31] seabass40: i would play world of  STARcraft tbh lol
[5:38:41] mozavich: @bootscalp doubt. i think MMOs are changing, not dying
[5:38:43] lorddrekken: can you take a 488 warrior tank?
[5:38:46] neverbornlucky: Towelliee people want wow vr but laying in bed not standing up style \
[5:38:47] Subbed_No_Ban: M+ all day baby Iâm good
[5:38:48] cynical_j0k3r: Lol. A br mode for wow. Iâm dead
[5:38:54] Davedaman26: what about bring back those scenarios.
[5:38:55] smashwow: @xLink_tv HOV was legion. MOP was before. they're pulling in MOP dungeons now. they'd have to completely rebuild anything from vanilla to cata because of the the toolkit difference.
[5:39:08] Broomba: even zelda 1 is similar to a mmo
[5:39:11] wicked_whackattack: wheres Riots MMo they been talkign smack forever

[5:39:14] Mecabeast: destiny was pretty unique bringing looters shooter elements to the mmo genre
[5:39:23] mavericks312: @bootscalp company sales would prove your opinion wrong
[5:39:33] smashwow: again could they yes. would be it be a good thing yes. but it's not the same as getting NEW dungeons every patch / xpac.
[5:39:40] ttvhandzz: 5 min away from the house if you need a hunter
[5:40:02] EpicJune: emergent AI i think is the next step imho, npc migrating, attacking towns, pledging, etc
[5:40:23] Itshiko: 2/2/6

[5:40:28] wicked_whackattack: Pshhh when you cant get into keys ragnaros and azralon have your back LUL
[5:40:29] pentapenguin_: i think the ideal mmo would just be too much work for the devs to upkeep
[5:40:36] Itshiko: 2/3/10 works
[5:40:44] Khooya_: 2/3/10
[5:40:51] lorddrekken: the only other character I have somewhat ready is 389 warrior tank
[5:41:03] Mecabeast: 2/3/9 I think is common
[5:41:26] mordhaux: bring wildstar back with less elitism
[5:41:38] Khooya_: you can also go 2/4/12 or 14 if you want
[5:41:39] bootscalp: They want a "more money" model for MMO's now and it kills the games on inception. MMO's used to be the pinnacle of even playing fields online. Thats whats missing subs arent enough for them anymore
[5:41:44] seabass40: whos old enough to remember matrix online xd
[5:41:54] warrenny: @fonehtiks Elitism is on players
[5:41:59] GingerGambit: all that melee
[5:42:06] pentapenguin_: that was a game ? LULW
