[1:23:54] Klanransalee: Yes i will
[1:23:54] Phrosen99: yup
[1:23:55] Kramgoing: Classic, classic som, classic tbc classic tbc som, classic wotlk, classic wotlk som when will it stop ….
[1:23:58] CreationzUK: if they change it up again
[1:24:01] shifty_trevor: Have you tried halo infinite ?
[1:24:02] Enmael00: ALL THE MORE REASON TO RUSH 60... less competition in rank 14
[1:24:02] kirbz09: yeah
[1:24:04] Willasuccashivayah: prob xD
[1:24:06] lunatik710: Classic is too much of a grind… people talk trash about retail but I have fun on retail everyday
[1:24:08] blastnovaarea52: yeah this is too grindy still i might not
[1:24:08] isosq: I dont think so
[1:24:12] Gizimoo86: who knows, still have couple classes unplayed
[1:24:14] baycitybum: if they do x8 exp ill do it
[1:24:21] daddiiox: ez lvling
[1:24:24] provokedt: leveling felt easy this time around it is starting to stall out in the lvl 40's
[1:24:26] grikstv: copium
[1:24:30] AIIain: @Swifty are they going to let us transfer to TBC?
[1:24:31] PapaBeks: I just can't stomach the grind again of vanilla
[1:24:32] oxy4real: i think x24 xp is better
[1:24:35] sun_kan: i hope they mess a bit with the classes next time
[1:24:39] redraidah: @Swifty what do you think of a Season of Divergence where any race can play any class and can pick either faction to play on
[1:24:42] Phrosen99: Oh.. wow classic. Nope
[1:24:46] isosq: We need faster leveling
[1:24:47] Phrosen99: Il just watch swifty play
[1:24:47] Zicero47: Shadowlands leveling speed :D thats fast
[1:24:49] quinraylo: if they make it like diablo boost leveling ill do it
[1:24:59] Kaldeem: If they do something like Ascension they maybe.
[1:24:59] Thorges: what if they add raids to classic? :o
[1:25:04] asnowgoose: they should bump professions at low level and make them yield exp like NW
[1:25:08] greer2grizzy: so the characters you make on SoM servers will be deleted in a year?
[1:25:09] Kaldeem: They need to break the game.
[1:25:09] Shredmuffn: private server community is in heaven
[1:25:14] Zicero47: What about TBC prepatch talents? :D next time
[1:25:14] redraidah: well itd be a temporary one time thing like this season
[1:25:15] Schwanken: The levling is pretty much all i like in classic. The end game isnt all that great imo. SoM didnt apeal to me tho, maybe if they made some radical gameplay changes.
[1:25:23] Em_cee__: I would play if I dont have to farm pummlers KEKW
[1:25:28] Gizimoo86: i did my warrior 44 -> 54 in 2 days just by questing and couple dungeons
[1:25:35] nucleargnome30: there is pvp in diablo2, i have the ears to prove it
[1:25:43] provokedt: out of arrows XD
[1:25:52] neonn984: I'd like to see them toy with the idea of adding content like an alternate timeline situation, maybe go into a few of the unreleased zones, add another raid and a few more CLASSIC dungeons. I think that would be cool
[1:25:53] Big_Zum: @swifty shaman leveling also just feels really slow Until 40 unfortunately
[1:26:04] AIIain: @Swifty aren't they letting us transfer our characters to TBC?
[1:26:06] Chosey: huh
[1:26:06] nucleargnome30: lol
[1:26:11] bgd940: no pvp whatsoever
[1:26:18] provokedt: @neonn984 not happening , and anything they did to change vanilla would be awful
[1:26:19] neevir: what's your 2h?
[1:26:34] bgd940: honestly diablo 2 was a dissapointment for me
[1:26:35] Enmael00: why not rush to level 60? less rank 14 grinders
[1:26:38] bgd940: got bored sooo fast of it
[1:26:44] Kaldeem: Morgan's Mace from SM
[1:26:56] bgd940: one of the only games i wish i got my money back for it

[1:32:20] blastnovaarea52: Its Broke at 60 also
[1:32:22] Zyxo95: Its fun to rush, its boring to go slow @driski
[1:32:23] Enmael00: so what if its boring? rank 14 is worth it .... actually NOT
[1:32:46] blastnovaarea52: my guild is ton of 60's and said its still broken to grind rank 14
[1:32:48] 2mize: AV is giving 3K to 5K honor per game

[1:35:05] Gizimoo86: Esfand is really busy with other stuff, so barely has time to play some games
[1:35:21] Psynei: Dude i remember that video!
[1:35:33] driski: @Zyxo95 nobody said it was fun to go slow LUL
[1:35:36] dslims: No sugar is good, but if you dont get sodium you die.
[1:36:04] Psynei: i used to watch alle the videos of you being in Puerto Rico aswell
[1:36:10] baraktus: you need salt for bones
[1:36:25] Poockins: well if you go none of either you die so you need a bit of both but keeping it low is good
[1:36:27] Polerize: plenty in everything just dont add it
[1:36:40] daddiiox: what happened
[1:36:43] Kramgoing: No sugars also death dude, for real. We’re steered by bloodsugar levels .
[1:36:45] kl0ppi: why do you avoid sodium
[1:36:49] Phrosen99: Everyone on twitch chat is a nutritionist
[1:36:53] Polerize: keep your salt down or get high blood pressure
[1:36:56] Klanransalee: just que up for a bg at low level of the bracket, you get tons of salt from that
[1:37:18] doubled09: @Phrosen99 and a doctor
[1:37:25] neevir: what did u eat on your cheat day?
[1:37:38] Kadly101: Salt also is very bad for wieght, if you eat lots of salt your body will get dehydrated and absorb a lot of water that you drink
[1:37:52] Enmael00: so true... squashed a lot of salty pvpers on the rank 14 grind and they accuse you of botting , etc

[1:46:08] Gizimoo86: drop % quests and running takes lots of time so its not 40 % overall
[1:46:17] StraughtLife: its basically just grinding, like kill 40 mobs for 10 something and it takes ages
[1:46:24] Enmael00: its slow because you can also be ganked in pvp servers
[1:46:30] Koozini: Hey man! it's been a long time, started watching you when I was 13 back in woltk, 25 today  :) glad your enjoying wow content!
[1:46:40] neevir: @ShepherdsTV you can buy the sub and then cancel it no? for 1 month

[1:46:55] NOHITJEROME: ahh ZF is one of my favorites :D
[1:47:11] NOHITJEROME: the mob drop quests have been rouuuuugh so far LUL ive been really unlucky
[1:47:19] Gizimoo86: i would say leveling with questing is 20 % faster overall with all running
[1:47:31] Jack_Fatspack: @neevir i have no idea.. for 12 years ive bought single months lol
[1:47:31] vanillasky7888: spaming dungs is faster and not that anoying for sure
[1:47:43] neonn984: the only quests worth grinding are the ones that chain into dungeon quests, that way you get crazy xp from the dungeon
[1:48:06] Kaldeem: Isn't that what the addon you have is for? The quest addon from Kargoz
[1:48:19] neevir: @ShepherdsTV ye im pretty sure you can sub and then cancel it for just 1 month

[2:42:11] isuther: im rank 0
[2:42:18] Garbaje_Gaming: thats why you wait till 60....
