[1:21:42] SonicAtomic: Well, Bobby Kotick may be leaving after all. Best thing to come to the company
[1:22:24] SonicAtomic: are they re-setting Classic ?
[1:22:25] MaxEffortFalkor: Raptors around Crossroads, but probably heavily farmed..
[1:22:37] Cowardpatty: I usually don't do the harpies until I'm 17 because of the mob density
[1:22:37] brandocalrissian1975: are you not pvp
[1:22:50] merrinator: @sonicatomic they’ve added fresh classic servers
[1:22:56] muzzbug2016: why is he leaving - whats the reason
[1:22:57] MaxEffortFalkor: and they gank you easily , the harpies
[1:22:57] MiamiRice: Hey Swifty, are BG's a good way to level up?

[1:23:49] aguado0405: España
[1:23:51] merrinator: @sonicatomic in addition to the regular servers which are on TBC they’ve added new “season of master” servers which are fresh vanilla with changes
[1:24:04] MrTeamTactical: i would probably just do some bg's at 19/29/39 probably the most fun times lol
[1:24:08] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:24:23] merrinator: So classic wow now consists of TBC servers and Vanilla servers
[1:24:28] MaxEffortFalkor: the hill
[1:24:34] muzzbug2016: have they got rid of stupid stats like agility and spirit
[1:24:42] muzzbug2016: together
[1:24:44] onliwon: thats true @MrTeamTactical
[1:25:04] merrinator: I think he means on items
[1:25:07] merrinator: Useless stat combos
[1:25:14] MaxEffortFalkor: life will be easier once you get Ankh, the self res
[1:25:18] Hyelander_: Today I learned that Agility is a stupid stat
[1:25:24] muzzbug2016: thaTS WHAT I MEANT
[1:25:26] MrTeamTactical: trying to get some nice gear ready for 19 rogue  bg's super fun
[1:25:32] muzzbug2016: oops caps

[1:25:41] MaxEffortFalkor: The Barren Chat is legendary :D
[1:25:45] domica_6: rogue leveling spirit is pretty good
[1:25:46] merrinator: I think they meant having agi+spirit on items being useless combo
[1:25:54] domica_6: like agility, spirit then everything else
[1:26:04] merrinator: AD
[1:26:06] Araxxia: when i first started to play wow Crossroads is where all the horde hung out :D
[1:26:10] merrinator: where the GIFTERS at
[1:26:14] domica_6: spirit gives hp regen
[1:26:17] MaxEffortFalkor: There's a pretty good set you can get in Wailing Caverns, the Serpent set, think that's good for Shamans
[1:26:22] Cowardpatty: Clearly when they were maing the game in early 2000's they were like "Shaman are spiritual, so they need lots of Spirit on their gear".
[1:26:30] riv1: how's the running sim
[1:27:01] EliBourne: agility is great for a hunter
[1:27:18] merrinator: So the cloth gear is supposedly “holy” and “spiritual”?
[1:27:22] muzzbug2016: pyromGlare
[1:27:56] bomba316: k paso amigo, just wondering are you in the #AMC play, it will be the greatest transfer of wealth in human history.
[1:27:58] domica_6: I mean you guys can google it, agi and spirit is actually a good combo
[1:28:26] Cowardpatty: Yeah, for Ninja-Clerics
[1:28:32] Cowardpatty: :P
[1:28:38] domica_6: Having spirit reduces downtime for leveling since it restores hp

Your Guild would be remarked as the most resourceful because they help the most with resources in dungeons.

[10:25:48] mattymatt202: What was the reason for the second release of classic again?
[10:26:01] Slayer_Eagleone: Swifty so basically this is Classic Prime Plus+++ ??
[10:26:17] Enmael00: they have no idea to make new games... so they recycle
[10:26:23] Onehiitter: So people don't play in private servers
[10:26:31] Pantteranova: Its all about being F R E S H
[10:26:40] Chosey: there's a demand for the fresh leveling experience
[10:26:46] NewMetaOrder: @Swifty i think people were asking for fresh and SoM was the answer
[10:26:52] Keartor: I think they do so cuz they are losing players on shadowlands
[10:26:59] back2r00ts: classic with a few changes - mc/ony has new mechanics and u lvl faster
[10:27:15] mattymatt202: Swifty are you happy with the current state of wow?
[10:27:15] Putcride: @Swifty they probably saw how quick people finished classic and decided to give them a more tuned version where its more loose
[10:27:30] jabek1: especially after the NW flop
[10:27:36] Slayer_Eagleone: Classic Prime Plus
[10:27:40] Pantteranova: The private server scene is plagued with people wanting F R E S H servers. Blizzard is just doing the same.
[10:27:44] kelorik_: capcap
[10:27:46] verqp: swifty are you gonna get rank14 this time?
[10:27:50] NewMetaOrder: imagine if they added content to classic
[10:27:58] kelorik_: you got this!
[10:28:00] T_M_FIELD: I mean they're just doing what private servers did, no one wants to just sit at end game forever
[10:28:28] NewMetaOrder: at this point blizzard is gonna think WoW is a staple for some people
[10:28:32] iManley: its easier for ally as they have salv/kings - better time raiding
[10:28:33] NewMetaOrder: and im not saying its a bad thing

[10:31:33] SpongesTV: 10.0 the patch
[10:31:34] CardinalTX: Holly Longdale came from Everquest. Now they are following the EQ formula of re releasing the game on progression severs, tweaking the rule set every time. Keeps the subs rolling
[10:31:43] temp3st98: next expansion
[10:31:44] NewMetaOrder: patch 10.0 will be better than shadowlands
[10:32:06] mattymatt202: Isn’t next expansion the awakening one?

[10:32:57] mattymatt202: Pretty sure it is
[10:33:03] blazzedzz: yeah im also curious why shaman swifty?
[10:33:11] NewMetaOrder: the only FRESH way to play this is buy a low end 2005 pc build
