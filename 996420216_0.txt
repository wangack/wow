[0:30:13] Dark575: anywhere else mobile yes are meh
[0:30:18] tomfoolery_1: @TheEnstraynomic I thought it was just me.
[0:30:21] Dark575: games*
[0:30:22] Harkaat: @Donny956 it isnt. its blizzard trying to do a cash grab for a nostaglia game
[0:31:04] Felixoutlaw4200: did u move?

[0:31:24] Dark575: have a feeling the game was mostly made for the Asia market though
[0:31:28] Twonce: yeah i got the hdmi adaptor cuz i was streaming mobile games for a while
[0:31:29] Mr_fantastic123: fuck mobile gaming its just a way of getting microtransactions into F2P games
[0:31:31] Felixoutlaw4200: SeemsGood
[0:31:39] Morpheusx25: @Dark575 def was mostly
[0:32:13] tomfoolery_1: Yes, Wortham is in other Diablo games.
[0:32:33] Dopplemonger: @Donny956 of course it is gonna be> I don't know why people are so negative. as graphics get better there is no reason not to
[0:33:12] tomfoolery_1: That'll do it. Rip that guy.
[0:33:17] TheEnstraynomic: no voice acting for that?
[0:33:22] Dopplemonger: the mtx in phone games came about because people refused to buy games. They HAD to be free on mobile to be played.
[0:33:25] Twonce: who the heck is Skarn!!!
[0:33:49] TheEnstraynomic: @Twonce i thought for a second it was blizzard throwing a lulzy reference to the streamer skarmtank LUL
[0:33:52] Mr_fantastic123: @Dopplemonger dosent mean they are better than regular games
[0:34:05] areafive: This seems like a weird thing to want be part of.

[0:38:24] Twonce: me too i just seen that
[0:38:36] tomfoolery_1: Looks like its blocked. Waiting for more story?
[0:38:43] Dopplemonger: Mobile games aren't meant to sit down and play for hours on end. It's literally crazy to compare a mobile game to a full release pc game.
[0:38:57] Twonce: those were blue elites
[0:39:14] tomfoolery_1: The game is great looking all things considered though. I love it.
