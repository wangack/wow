[0:31:22] TheInfamous_One: u use cosmic flux to upgrade your leggo to max itemlv this season
[0:31:22] jokare: YOU CAN xD
[0:31:25] koiyruu: ^

[2:20:20] Ossebs: Can i advance the campaign in zereth mortis when i complete "patterns within patterns"???
[2:20:52] Zelrise: You have big epic quest lines that go all the way through Zereth Mortis and lead to the conclusion of many of the events in Shadowlands, the fate of the Jailer, the fate of the Shadowlands as a whole. Awesome quests. Once you’ve done them, you the player have done them. We don’t want to make every character, every alt go through those experiences unless they want to replay them. That’s something where we make sure the major unlocks there are account-wide.
[2:20:58] Zelrise: thats one part of the interview
[2:21:00] Zelrise: sry for wall

[3:19:25] cravefuglz: its for next season so no
[3:19:32] cravefuglz: which is next week
[3:19:35] Slayer_Eagleone: like less than 1% of players get 2400 no?
[3:19:45] cravefuglz: yes
[3:19:51] ColdCassidy: yup, they should have made it unlockable at 2.1k since arenas are much more difficult in current meta than to push keystones
[3:19:51] GreenLizzardx: yes s3
[3:20:17] cravefuglz: yes
[3:20:20] Slayer_Eagleone: 2400 is gonna be a grind for sure

[3:37:59] Hyelander_: @zues2442 the easiest mmo to get into
[3:38:12] Pufendorf99: and u can buy 226 gear for 500 anima
[3:38:19] Apollion1: Did they update the addons?
[3:38:22] tearofaclown: agreed. its easy to pick up
[3:38:26] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[3:38:29] ColdCassidy: i need to finally get that RBG rating to 1800, to buy the banana gear, cant find groups since everyone needs just 1 warr
[3:38:54] cravefuglz: @Pufendorf99 but that only goes if he gets anima, which ofc he will by doing content but its more for alts if you got mains with tons from previous seasons
[3:39:20] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Nitronic by zircon -> https://prtzl.io/dAH195gNxyENnahp
[3:39:25] cravefuglz: rares drop blues, greens etc aswell in new zone so should be fairly easy to gear up, atleast bette rthan before
[3:39:27] ColdCassidy: its either that, or we just lose every bg , got stuck on 1.6k for 2 seasons now
[3:39:30] tearofaclown: some lower cr groups take 2 (melee cleaves)O
[3:39:33] Pufendorf99: You can transfer the anima to alts
[3:39:54] JakeTheBoy9: hey man how you like the new ptah
[3:39:54] cravefuglz: @Pufendorf99 his new, so thats not an option
[3:39:58] JakeTheBoy9: patch
[3:40:40] Hyelander_: @Pufendorf99 even if theyre new. a week of gameplay will get you enough anima to catch up
[3:40:42] ColdCassidy: the problem is , even if we have a good shotcaller, people just wont listen and run around aimlessly throwing the whole game
[3:40:43] brotherzttv: ye feel like its so hard to find a good RBG team
[3:41:26] Pufendorf99: Ahh, well its nice to gear up there as well, I dinged last night with this one I play on now, and went there with 140-150 ilvl. And I get, for example a 242 ring so its a huge upgrade
[3:41:46] cravefuglz: exactly, tons of blues/greens drop from new zone
[3:41:49] Noluck555: what do you get at 2400
[3:42:00] cravefuglz: mby not tons, but atleast alot
[3:42:03] Druidwolfe: is pvp on ally hopeless right now?

[3:45:49] TheEndIsNear777: 2 more years and 9 months and wow's been alive 20 years
[3:46:03] SomewhatRoyal: asmon, soda, swifty all the ogs of twitch started off on wow
[3:46:09] Druidwolfe: WoW is older than anyone wasting their time saying "dead game" in chat
[3:46:21] TheEndIsNear777: pshero said he already quit lost ark :(
[3:46:24] Kristoh: that doesnt change the fact the game is trash
[3:46:37] Druidwolfe: esfand quit lost ark
[3:46:45] Hyelander_: @Kristoh is that why youre watching someone stream it?
[3:46:48] Shipidik: @Druidwolfe i am player of 12 years and i can say that this is not wow trust me :D
[3:46:54] thereelkev: what addon is that you are using that shows what rares you have killed?
[3:46:55] SomewhatRoyal: its very pay to win

[3:48:00] SomewhatRoyal: yeah ok
[3:48:02] Shipidik: boosts = p2w
[3:48:02] ColdCassidy: you currently have hp from Wotlk and dmg from MoP, so kinda not balanced, hopefully next Expansion is "the" Expansion
[3:48:06] Kristoh: that wasnt directed at you btw swifty
[3:48:14] cravefuglz: @Drazon__ WHAT LOL???????????

[3:48:31] Kristoh: wow is indirectly p2w
[3:48:35] Hyelander_: Every time the new "wow killed comes out" streamer chat gets full of people bashing wow. then the "wow killer" dies and they all go back to playing wow
[3:48:39] Fitalityyy: No matter what state WoW is in, It's still my favorite game
[3:49:02] Kristoh: @Hyeland3r lol the only wow killer is blizzard themselves and theyre getting closer to killing it off
[3:49:10] Escanor_jc: hey swifty is 9.2 raid available or not yet?

[3:49:44] Leah__xoxo: I quit in BFA but I enjoy watching you because one, you're awesome and two, it satisfies my need to play!
[3:49:52] ColdCassidy: just think if they werent to make covenant abilities "offensive" and conduits ability helpers, then the exp would have been fine
[3:49:56] cravefuglz: Normal and Heroic unlocks next reset
[3:49:59] Fitalityyy: Did you see asmon go to that island?

[3:51:08] Moose_Like_This: 0
[3:51:44] Shipidik: people are boring about grind artifacts, soul ash or other things and we are doing them with alt. there is no logic of like that. they should bring Final Fantasy XIV, they should bring Lost Ark alt system and wow could be amazing again. but in this situation nah...
[3:51:50] Ronnieboy65: 2k
[3:51:55] elsiefleur: 2k flux i think
[3:51:57] ColdCassidy: got 3500+ just from 1 day playing, used those 3 Vault tokens, they award 500 Flux
