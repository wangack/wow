[3:09:47] saund: Go to coordinates 20 67 the health increases of the boss, there's a shark there in water, kill the shark with blood on you and he drops an item, with the item you can pick up the sword.  @bean

[5:09:22] Inzio: what does the boss drop?  i just got back home @Bean
[5:09:23] scarlboro: i think you need to kill 3 loas on 3 different layers at the same time to simulate ZG tiger boss for the bengal tiger to have a 1% drop chance
