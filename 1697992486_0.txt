[2:41:21] CoraDeVine: @garbageguygary I'm more of a solo player myself, but if I need help with a quest or something, its not too hard to find someone, depending on the server. If you want to play with people more, use a more populated server
[2:41:48] nocturnal_2195: Icyviens.com is the other guides website
[2:41:54] DoughBoi_Trev: @thenomanslands it's Air

[2:46:40] nocturnal_2195: monkaS
[2:47:02] CoraDeVine: It ain't that serious dude
[2:47:35] REALPolarbeezy: im up, you can down it now
[2:58:55] Exxcar: They getting tire peepoSad
[2:58:59] Exxcar: tired*
[3:00:42] Nebulizer87: hotfixes and solo shuffle gripes prob
[3:01:16] Nebulizer87: yeah im avoiding it till we get some leaver penalties
[3:01:29] Nebulizer87: the prob is say u go 5-0 they leave u get nothing
[3:01:38] NordoTv: Ban them for a week from doing m+
[3:02:57] Incredible_Sausage: RiO give them a Leaver Score
[3:05:54] REALPolarbeezy: @Incredible_Sausage Yeah, abandoned keys should be tracked.
[3:06:02] tastytictacs: can't believe they tuned dungeons so only evoker/rdruid/maybe hpriest can heal 20+s anymore :(
[3:09:09] tastytictacs: totally satire btw
[3:09:33] meboozie: ellesmere healing 23/34/25 as hpal
[3:09:55] tastytictacs: @meboozie had no idea where hpal stood, but that's good to hear
[3:10:12] tastytictacs: but like disc priest doesn't get to do high keys, lol
[3:10:37] tastytictacs: lil homies need love
[3:10:55] meboozie: which is a shame, disc seems like one of the most complicated healers to play too lol
[3:10:58] Moiste: there are disc priests that do high keys, just requires your group not to take too much avoidable damage
[3:11:05] Moiste: so its not recommended for pugs lol
[3:11:15] tastytictacs: can they actually do the last boss in cos?
[3:12:03] Moiste: after the nerf, maybe
[3:12:27] tastytictacs: idk, i love that healing is harder.. but somethin like 600k in 4 seconds seems excessive
[3:12:50] tastytictacs: at least at a key level that rewards gear.. That's like IO pushing level damage
[3:14:04] Moiste: once i get big gear I'll give disc keys a shot.. it's my favorite healing spec but so far i've only been using it in raid
[3:14:31] tastytictacs: ya, it definitely excels in raid in comparison.. ive always been too stupid to play disc
[3:15:35] Moiste: It's rough not being the meta healing spec anymore, i get declined from groups even if I have 100 more score than the lead
[3:15:35] Sathfire: thats awesome, off stream keys a different vibe
[3:15:56] Sathfire: haha same
[3:20:39] Trixstah187: hey hey how goes raid tonight?
[3:20:58] Sayryn: His voice is so smoothing.
