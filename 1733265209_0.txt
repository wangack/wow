[5:22:32] Return_to_Nothing: u dont have killshot visibile on bars btw, so how u gonna know when u can use it before execute range
[5:23:17] Cowardpatty: Do you see the blue arrows on either side of your character that show up after Aimed Shot?  Those will either be 1 or 2 stacks of "Precise Shots", which buffs Arcane/Chimaera Shot.  If you don't see those, it's not really worth using Arcane/Chimaera Shot as the damage will be low.
