[0:39:21] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everbody!
[0:39:29] MrGattz: why would it bother you? it was the hot marketing thing to do at the time and it was a way for them to test some systems.
[0:40:00] Etny2k: i know it makes sense to do a br but i was bothered cause it wasnt what i wanted.

[0:45:41] Carahail: are alpha's normally a long time? an they are like the bare bones right?
[0:46:19] rsimpson105: @Kit_Stormwind the actual point of them yes, although some companies use those basically as just PR at this point vs actual testing
[0:46:20] MrGattz: @Kit_Stormwind i think they are a bit more than barebones but yeah for ashes its still gonna be a while

[1:10:49] Swoldemortt: Dumb question, but is it better for someone looking to get into WoW to start in classic or should I just jump into retail? @towelliee
[1:10:51] Luuin: amazon game studio needs to have New World do well. otherwise they're batting 100 for failed or cancelled games.
[1:10:53] Barkerisonfire: No Prideful at all now
[1:10:55] Broomba: Only thing about aoc I am ???? Is the mayor, taxes, etc

[1:11:00] Vivelli: idk if yall caught new worlds tweet before they deleted it for alpha. end of alpha they had a big dev battle
[1:11:01] peinen: love not having to be concerned about % anymore in M+

[1:13:10] Kisswani: !ashes
[1:13:27] Vivelli: @belfastcl its marketing, keep ppl interested etc. could backfire with the Pepegas in chat
[1:13:39] ThaOriginalGamester: I'll randomly join a Az/Rag group to embrace the shit show 🤣
[1:13:47] Razzin_: Ashes wants to be old school mmo
[1:13:49] stealthx23: next gen was destiny 2 lol
[1:13:49] LogiBare: Do you think it be smart for these up and coming mmos to hit the console market?
[1:13:51] TheCliffyShow: Next-Gen is becoming such a buzz word now.
[1:14:01] echoingtruth: when are you streaming ashes?
[1:14:05] belfastcl: @Vivelli if it's not near what we saw with nw, it will backfire, even if it's truly just a testing alpha
[1:14:14] Recknry: Lineage/GW2 also
[1:14:21] Broomba: Next generation mmos is like the hype for a wow 2.0
[1:14:24] Alepouditsa: @TheCliffyShow i roll my eyes evry time i hear it
[1:14:26] LogiBare: Do you think it be smart for these up and coming mmos to hit the console market?

[1:14:33] DragonofWolves: There can be no new generation of MMO's honestly. The really only thing that COULD be next generation is when Blizzard finally gives in and makes guild and player housing for WoW
[1:14:40] Luuin: That's why im glad New World got rid of the forced PvP and item drop on death. Was so toxic during the first closed alpha.
[1:14:47] DragonofWolves: because that'll get people talking

[1:15:11] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @ExcellsTv (warning)
[1:15:15] kaze171: @Towelliee whats that addon that tells you the classes in the group
[1:15:19] belfastcl: albion has been growing, but it's a niche thing
[1:15:20] Zettabyte: Russia FeelsBadMan
[1:15:25] uawildcat04: FF14
[1:15:34] JonnyScotland: @kaze171 i think that's just raider io?
[1:15:38] Octavian360: @towelliee thoughts on Crowfall? Looks a lot better now.
[1:15:41] Ncorbino: new here. did towelie try crowfall?
[1:15:49] ThaOriginalGamester: if blizz adds housing, i want the achievements to be tied to physical furniture. that'd be neat

[1:15:54] LogiBare: Do u think mmos should hit the console market and maybe that would be the big breaking point for mmos?
[1:16:04] MrTerkyMan: i honestly have a hard time believing ashes or new world will last on a large scale. i hope im wrong and just basing that on my own preferences
[1:16:04] Moobot: TBC has officially launched! || If you would like to join our community guild in classic while we prepare, we are on Azuresong Horde! Send a request message in the #WoW-TBC channel in Towelliee's discord and a recruiter will be in touch!

[1:16:09] belfastcl: @ExcellsTv eso and ffxiv are on console I think
[1:16:13] miztertea1: @kaze171 it’s a weakaura, it sorts by rio and tells class
[1:16:14] Darkshy: !ashes
[1:16:17] Renzay83: yeah its the same route
[1:16:27] LogiBare: @belfastcl Yeah but i mean new mmos
[1:16:28] kaze171: @Towelliee go hakkar platform then go to venari boss
[1:16:31] MistaHat: absolutely agree. That's why survival games dont have longevity. you cant just pvp forever. your game will either lose people or not perform enough to keep going. And this is from someone who likes to pvp
[1:16:32] deedeemegadoodooo: what does Dratnos say?
[1:16:41] DragonofWolves: Yeah except Blizzard might not ever add player housing. WoW's engine might now allow it. Wildstars did but i dont think Wildstar was built off WoW's engine
[1:16:46] dankmeliodas: Crowfall launched with 3k users. Shit I didn’t even know it came out
[1:17:03] stealthx23: @MistaHat you can if you resert then every month and year like rust haha
[1:17:08] ThaOriginalGamester: @MistaHat if they added quests to Conan Exiles it would be a great MMO-lite
[1:17:31] Darkshy: What time does ashes of creation alpha start?
[1:17:41] Luuin: I forgot about that game, was in development for so long.
[1:17:43] Alepouditsa: ppl don't get 228 ilvl in mythic now someone in my guild was compling about it last night and the say that the "big boys" are back that y danKEK
[1:18:06] MistaHat: @MistaHat yeah that might be cool. just saying though, there's a reason new world changed
[1:18:11] Luuin: or felt like it anyways

[1:21:39] AmZambie: if you backed it way back when on kickstarter they grandfathered you in
[1:21:41] jerseyfive: wtf paying the company 500$ to test for them
[1:21:43] Sir_LagalotTV: I thought you couldn’t buy the package for alpha anymore ?
[1:21:48] RunningOutOfRAM: 50000000000000000 to play the non game Pog
[1:21:49] lithium364: yeah so many kids are gonna pay the 500 dollar from their parents credit cards just to "play" with their streamer LUL

[1:22:20] uawildcat04: @Towelliee no matter how much he/you says that its just a test, a lot of people are gonna be turned off by how underdeveloped it is. I think it was a bad move on them to do it
[1:22:30] Thunderbrew: @JonnyScotland A thank you

[3:07:19] brewsephtv: Wasn't 8.2 -> 8.3 like July to January?
[3:07:20] KillaPr0: depends on covid
[3:07:25] Dcarter: 5 months till december i think its possible
[3:07:26] Hazno: @Xailen no it won't, but it will make a lot of people unhappy
[3:07:26] ItsToxicQT: i dont think Blizzard can handle another 7 month patch length at all
[3:07:27] 無職提督: i mean, delay is the new normal
[3:07:33] Clicklesly: Wasn't anima drought the theme of this expansion? So it makes sense Kappa

[3:08:27] Kisswani: " 9.2 i blizzard's last chance " Kappa
[3:08:32] JonnyScotland: is there one more raid?
[3:08:46] ElDrakenMan: do you think its smarter to launch before endwalker or after?
[3:08:48] Hazno: @JonnyScotland there will be at least one more raid in Shadowlands, yes
[3:08:54] toobaked1987: Seasonal MMO is what WoW has turned itself into
[3:09:11] JonnyScotland: @Hazno good was wprried there wouldn't be
[3:09:14] JonnyScotland: worried*
[3:09:50] Kisswani: Reaper yeah
[3:09:57] Hazno: @JonnyScotland they stated the Jailer would be the end boss of this expansion before Shadowlands was released, and he's not even a boss in the current raid, so yeah, 100% another raid in 9.2, and who knows if we'll get a 9.3
[3:10:04] Kisswani: it's also capped
[3:10:07] Allvarez: yo i did hard mode taz, that dung is legit
[3:10:20] belfastcl: no mmo can keep veteran players for months without new content
[3:10:57] Hazno: I don't get how people ONLY play WoW.. use the break between content to unsub and play other games

[3:31:56] Naicella: or don't have holy trinity
[3:32:06] TheInfedible: you think most of its players are younger than 17? @therealonous
[3:32:09] Broomba: you had NES, Sega, PS, Xbox, etc you buy and play the platforms/games you want to have fun its not based on a certain commitment
[3:32:09] duffluv22: @broomba yeah, but your fanbase has also spent those same years with their favorite streamer

[4:05:28] JonnyScotland: I keep running around on ground mounts forgetting i can fly
[4:05:51] Aidler: a tragic casualty of it's own flawed marketing
[4:06:07] TheUnknowing: I feel like AOC will fall to the same fate, the hype of it is too much too early, honestly the creators are to blame but at the same time it's understandable, they want their game to be awesome and want people to be excited
