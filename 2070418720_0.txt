[0:20:43] heymomimonttv: @shikari01 i agree, seems he can push everything he plays to at least 2k. just never once seen him touch dk haha, but even then id think he could pick it up quick and play it well

[0:43:56] kreeblins: @Koraszdormu No i feel like the trade off is worth. Classes have equal stun durations and they aren't limited to being stuck channeling the ability so I think it's a fair trade off to get better positioning from it.

[0:49:15] figurines: @dolanknoob its fine in 2s. and to some extent 3s. but in shuffle you need mastery for dampening

[1:39:49] JarJar_Brinkz: Well it is healthier, no? As a 1 to 1 comparison
[1:39:53] JarJar_Brinkz: I don't think anyone was lied to
[1:39:53] brenory: but it's lower NET carbs
[1:40:01] Vendrek: Fiber is good...but too much fiber causes bowl movement issues.
[1:40:05] cantfindthebox: corn has no nutrlitional value and as someone with gut issues i do have to make sure i get enough fiber
[1:40:10] brenory: isn't that what they always said lol
[1:40:19] brenory: fiber negates carbs

[1:40:39] mindrazor: You would have lived if you were eating brown rice!
[1:40:39] bigmancamx: brown rice has a very slightly (basically negligible) lower glycemic index
[1:40:41] galdinator: Brown rice taste like trash so its corporate propaganda that its healthier
[1:40:48] JarJar_Brinkz: That doesnt make it any less healthier
[1:40:50] Trzuncek: chia is great source of fiber
[1:40:51] Badasti: idk according to google corn has the following: Calories: 96 Water: 73% Protein: 3.4 grams Carbs: 21 grams Sugar: 4.5 grams Fiber: 2.4 grams Fat: 1.5 grams

[1:41:21] galdinator: @Badasti corn is the worst food and there is no reason to eat it
[1:41:23] JarJar_Brinkz: Then those people shouldn't eat brown rice
[1:41:28] Voriq: This song feels like Life after 6 beers
[1:41:30] Vendrek: Corn is one of the worst foods for most everyone except those that don't get enough starch
[1:41:33] Voriq: widepeepoHappy
[1:41:37] Badasti: @galdinator oh is that so
[1:41:38] JarJar_Brinkz: but thats the same as saying someones allergic to tomatos, so theyre unhealthy
[1:41:45] Rzzzi: white stuff spikes your blood sugar

[1:46:15] hamsti: Do you wash your rice?
[1:46:18] hamsti: Theres only 1 correct answer
[1:46:23] mindrazor: Brown rice has 80 times more arsenic in it than white rice--not good.
[1:46:26] BCboy_: dps perma fighting on ramp feels unplayable as healer on this map
[1:46:28] hamsti: LUL sometimes
[1:46:29] brenory: aint nobody got time for that
[1:46:54] shivwren: We don't get enough arsenic in our diets. People are living to be 100+
[1:46:57] dipicat: bro nokhudon cooks me
[1:46:59] JarJar_Brinkz: It is factually proven that brown rice(Real brown rice) has better nutritional value than white rice. It's not a myth. It's not an insane amount, but enough to convince everyone to make a big deal out of it
[1:47:00] dipicat: the ramp is so unfortunate
[1:47:06] CabinetMistake: it's a bad map for shuffle for sure i think
[1:47:19] cantfindthebox: this shuffle i am in is awful
[1:47:23] JarJar_Brinkz: Now whether it tastes good or not LUL that's up for debate. I can't stand eating brown rice
[1:48:06] brenory: it's negligible enough that no one would be able to tell a difference between a diet on white rice vs brown with all other factors equal
[1:48:06] tinkbelledhtv: U had that dh kill
[1:48:14] brenory: other than that they enjoyed their lives more eating white
[1:48:25] JarJar_Brinkz: @brenory 100%
[1:48:39] JarJar_Brinkz: But we know all they need is the slightest margin and they're gonna make headlines of it
[1:48:51] BCboy_: I feel like i would like this map if the ramps were just normal pilars but the ramps are just too awkward
[1:49:21] psychxsp: lol
[1:49:22] dmgcurry: what can u do against illidan himself
[1:49:23] CabinetMistake: jesus
[1:49:23] psychxsp: for real
[1:49:24] JarJar_Brinkz: That was so unfortunate LUL
[1:49:24] coreyehebert: lol
[1:49:29] Foe009: kek
[1:49:30] shivwren: Probably could have healed that with a belly full of brown rice
[1:49:34] coreyehebert: thats how i feel on that map too as a healer
[1:49:40] coreyehebert: someone is ALWAYS los
[1:49:45] Duckmeat__: how your belly bro?
[1:50:00] cantfindthebox: i'm at the point in my solo shuffle these dps have run out of los so many times im just letting them die if they do it
[1:50:25] azrothlol: just reroll DH man
[1:50:44] Duckmeat__: he didnt mean that
[1:50:46] shad3dspectr3: Nice
[1:50:50] shad3dspectr3: LOLLLLLL
[1:51:09] coreyehebert: yep. gotta balance the scales for that under represented class for sure
[1:51:09] Jankenz: never see DH in PVP anymore... wonder what happened to them
[1:51:27] ferahgok: It's only 66% of all lobby's. So severely underrepresented. Need to get up to 100%.
[1:51:50] Jankenz: @ferahgok yup, rookie numbers...
[1:51:54] CabinetMistake: ulti penne would be a great dish name at olive garden

[1:56:47] andyloltv: just link again bro
[1:56:52] JarJar_Brinkz: Ven was so distracted he forgot to make a shadow clone to heal both teammates Kappa
[1:56:54] amgine04: getting blamed no matter what is part of healer gameplay though
[1:56:55] AlphasaurusRexx: there were two games ven you only shit on him 50% of the way @venruki

[1:57:47] cantfindthebox: lol its true, i was the shams 1%
[1:57:59] TheNutcracka: its because ppl have 0 awareness and look in the cc breaks details after they lose
[1:58:08] Tiebot87: @venruki we need some dev games.
[1:58:11] zen_oni_shinobi: ven  the wow community doesn't deserve you. there's a lot of people that way.  especially online for some reason.
[1:58:12] amgine04: i love my shuffles that end with "NO LINK?!" and they're literally on the other side of the map. high rated too :)

[2:00:38] Badasti: this is my least favourite meta of DF so far
[2:00:50] Badasti: for me yeah
[2:00:53] wackpoetic: MMR deflation, Cyclone, Shadowy Duel - fix these and Retail would be great
[2:00:56] azrothlol: retail is the best wow right now if you play DH
[2:01:00] SteLawBro: Retail is amazing if youre just playing for fun. Once you get good the flaws show but i think overall its still awesome.
[2:01:01] Mhortai: Ya people are DEF forgetting how bad that was lol
[2:01:02] galdinator: Nah we all just logged ret and had fun

[2:01:07] amgine04: gearing and gear imbalance is 10x better than SL
[2:01:08] Msv2: Lol
[2:01:11] Xeliumimar: Funny both of these crap metas happened in the SAME expansion
[2:01:14] andyloltv: the aug period of time last season was zzz also
[2:01:17] figurines: The biggest issue with retail is people quitting. even if you enjoy it.
[2:01:18] cantfindthebox: when did retpocalypse occur
[2:01:19] wackpoetic: I like the meta a lot now it just feels so deflated that I don't think I can get 2400 so I'd rather play alts
[2:01:26] Msv2: I dont have a sub badge anymore q.q
[2:01:26] Badasti: i agree ret was worse, this meta is just boring and irritating as shit
[2:01:29] cantfindthebox: i came back for DF but didn't do some expacs
[2:01:29] jporter_: but they were getting tuned every couple weeks werent they? DH been untouched all season

[2:02:20] azrothlol: Sell Sell Sell
[2:02:23] skez_live: @venruki what is your take on the metal imbalances as it relates to the ease of gearing in DF.  In past expansions, it wasnt as easy to meta hop, you think DF it has been more felt since you could easily switch classes?
[2:02:23] Onshuffle: idk im making a shitload though

[2:02:56] thedonconn: @Badasti why?
[2:02:56] dmgcurry: time to do a tier list for economies
[2:02:57] dropbombsss: chat calling it a bubble what could go wrong lol
[2:02:59] dawnovun: Canada doesn't - Canada actually has an economy equivalent to only California lol
[2:03:03] Mhortai: I mean there are people rich enough to solve world hunger and it not even really dent them right now

[2:03:26] Kujo_XX: It's a world scale economy
[2:03:27] Badasti: @thedonconn competition to bring prices down, they are on par with nvidia this gen outside of niche use cases
[2:03:30] hamsti: Cali has a bigger economy then most of the european countries
[2:03:32] Badasti: better sized as well
[2:03:33] Kujo_XX: Like 4th in the world
[2:03:51] wackpoetic: California EZ
[2:03:53] Omnadren: I mean isn't like Cali, Texas and NY like 99% of US economy?
[2:03:58] Mhortai: Los Angelos ALONE is a huge economy
[2:04:01] Msv2: 39 million people in California btw
[2:04:03] dawnovun: Wasn't meaning that to be rude or anything.  Canada is rank #9 for GDP
[2:04:05] Msv2: only
[2:04:06] thedonconn: @Badasti what do you consider their niche uses
[2:04:12] cantfindthebox: i realize the consumer cards are a fraction, i also know they still price gauge severely

[2:05:12] Msv2: Only 300 million people in America btw
[2:05:19] ManaoKungPao: all that money and we still can't afford universal healthcare

[2:32:26] skez_live: just to be sure
[2:32:37] skylightxo: People trashing DH even though the main reason for Dh being higher rated on average is due to the higher skill level of those who play it. I've never seen a noob play Dh to a high level. Yes it has easy learning curve, but insane skill cap, even more than sub rogue imho

[2:35:35] FergaVee: ur mog is more op than DH's rn
[2:35:36] shanerrrs: heelys were nice
[2:35:36] SweatyDaniels: sometimes i dream that i have heelies and i wake up feeling like i need to buy a pair
[2:35:37] rainmannxz: coffee Kreygasm
[2:35:43] Magottx: i got detention in 5th grade for heelying in the hallway FeelsBadMan
[2:35:47] buffnac: I watched too many people faceplant from those
[2:35:49] Applezbtw: you guys are being mean to DH' players. luckily they cant read so they wont be hurt by this chat

[2:36:07] zerx_gg: who said that
[2:36:10] cyborg1141: :)
[2:36:17] apaine27: How do some DHs Vengeful Retreat and then jump up further in the air?  I’ve always wondered that.
[2:36:28] Magottx: It really feels so bad getting destroyed by DH's that dont kick or swap or do anything man
[2:36:28] hoopscotch: hi everyone
[2:36:37] likeewlock: where I can find that graphic?
[2:36:38] ferahgok: My boomy was like that during the Full Moon era last season
[2:36:39] FergaVee: nah those are the glory days
[2:36:44] zirstro: @zerx_gg LUL

[2:36:58] Roxxybolts: I tried to make my DH work and I just couldn’t get it down
[2:37:00] Magottx: why would i do that when i can play afflic rukiCry
[2:37:03] Roxxybolts: any tips?
[2:37:08] emergencxyz: I would like to purchase a solo shuffle q pop
[2:37:10] Cocoapuffs1: @apaine27 use glide/ fel rush to extend glimpse buff
[2:37:13] McLarge: Real talk for a sec, I hate that if I do manage to finally get Gladiator this season, people will try to diminish my accomplishment by telling me it was free for DHs.
[2:37:14] fungames: ven is 4'11
[2:37:17] skylightxo: @venruki what are u then
[2:37:25] shtain3r: ven can u please tell me the secrets to win dh as disc priest outlaw in 2s. im fasturated
[2:37:30] hoopscotch: @mclarge yes
[2:37:30] shikari01: it is free for dh
[2:37:33] Roxxybolts: I meannnnnn
[2:37:35] driftwood_tc: @McLarge it was though.
[2:37:38] Msv2: True about stretchin
[2:37:40] dyllbarx: congrats on glad @McLarge
[2:37:51] DJ_HappyDays: GLAD is still an acomplishment no matter what class u get it on
[2:38:01] mrxilio: DH so good and the Set looks like a Demonic Giraffe.
[2:38:01] galdinator: people will diminish any accomplishment even if u get r1 on the hardest class @McLarge
[2:38:02] Roxxybolts: I’m glad you are glad
[2:38:02] skylightxo: @venruki Do you think r1 shuffle or r1 3v3 is more indictator of skill? Or is it equal
[2:38:06] zen_oni_shinobi: absolutley
[2:38:14] hoopscotch: as someone who doesn’t have glad ever I can confidently say no one else’s glad achievement is deserved
[2:38:14] Onshuffle: about to get my first glad playing pres
[2:38:19] DJ_HappyDays: i am glad roxxi is glad you are glad
[2:38:54] zen_oni_shinobi: from where i sit both brackets deserve equal respect.
[2:38:57] Applezbtw: the divide used to be the same for 5s players and 3s players getting rank 1 back in the day
[2:38:57] Cocoapuffs1: a dps can be carried in shuffle tbh. healer not as much imo
[2:39:08] emergencxyz: Bro my stummy is fkd rn
[2:39:09] Roxxybolts: I can make a 42 on my final this semester and still pass LUL
[2:39:11] cyborg1141: Think you can match ur shuffle with 3s
[2:39:13] Axtin: the truth about getting r1 in 3s is a lot of it is just networking
[2:39:19] skylightxo: @Cocoapuffs1 GL being carried to r1 in shuffle LUL
[2:39:22] galdinator: world of compcraft Pog
[2:39:25] skylightxo: @Axtin Exactly
[2:39:32] cyborg1141: If you play with randoms
[2:39:36] stealthwalker99: r1 ss can be win traded that's the big issue. Someone last season on enh did a +200 point win trade with the same healer 3 hours before the season ended
[2:39:38] driftwood_tc: Who the fuck wants to network in their freetime when they just wanna game and relax.
[2:39:38] emergencxyz: @Axtin Speaking of hey axtin want to q 3s
[2:39:42] lightsflux: well when youre at r1 mmr in shuffle its not like your team is bad
[2:39:48] DJ_HappyDays: @Roxxybolts TAKES TOKENS
[2:39:52] bumbledragn: You can say goodbye to Venruki  just by describing a medical appliance...look....Ven-til-later...u should make a character named Ventilater
[2:40:01] paraflashtv: solo shuff should be with bots. there would not a big difference.
[2:40:04] Onshuffle: @Axtin wait so i cant get r1 because my teammates suck? Kappa
[2:40:04] itsallrngasf: people whine alot aswell
[2:40:06] Toonahz: im only r1 because of axtin
[2:40:14] kritzytko: @Toonahz lmao
[2:40:18] lnlprime: GM
[2:40:21] bjak_: Ive been able to pass 2400 in SS this season and last, but struggle passing like 2100 in 3s (LFGing)

[2:40:55] mrxilio: feel like even Glad is networking... gotta know people to push
[2:41:20] brewtank: @venruki evenin’ Mr Ruki
[2:41:21] dyllbarx: its the BEST feeling
[2:41:22] Roxxybolts: I don’t think glad is networking at all I just rando play with LFG to glad
[2:41:22] Cocoapuffs1: @skylightxo its easier to climb in shuff overall and if you're an op dps who manages to get lobbies with consistant r1 players it's essentially a carry
[2:41:23] cyborg1141: Went 3-3 in a 2 dh lobby gained rating yay
[2:41:28] dyllbarx: that LG
[2:41:28] zen_oni_shinobi: sure.  so pressure is there, but a different feeling?
[2:41:37] Applezbtw: the year is 2042 and Crusader is stil in LFG lookin for teammates for AWC

[2:41:56] TwoTanky: hi venruki!
[2:42:03] mrxilio: @Roxxybolts impressive honestly
[2:42:05] Cocoapuffs1: as healer it's a struggle to do better than 3-3
[2:42:13] galdinator: that guy is high af
[2:42:17] bumbledragn: true
[2:42:21] Roxxybolts: @mrxilio it’s not just have to play well but voice makes a difference big time

[2:42:49] fazedoritoss: i think the biggest diff from 3s to shuffle is teh pacing shuffle is really fast while a 3s game is like 5-7mins per game
[2:42:59] rainmannxz: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING VENRUKI <3 <3 <3 <3
[2:43:06] Roxxybolts: 3s are the worstttttt
[2:43:10] dipicat: @fazedoritoss yup. you probs especially notice this as aff where you have 0 pressure until damp in 3s lol
[2:43:16] Roxxybolts: shuffles are even worse than that LUL

[2:44:20] fazedoritoss: u cant kill totems now unless u target it
[2:44:21] Roxxybolts: who’s got the most water
[2:44:21] dyllbarx: FRED DURST
[2:44:23] freshdots321: venruki want to run some dh/unholy/healer
[2:44:34] Toonahz: @dipicat i wish i didnt have to
[2:44:38] cyborg1141: Can you recycle the hello fresh packaging?
[2:44:40] SteLawBro: Thats the worse feeling. That youre just wasting your time.
[2:44:43] rainmannxz: NODDERS NODDERS NODDERS
[2:44:49] dyllbarx: @fazedoritoss that's literally how groundign was for the last 11 years bro
[2:44:52] buffnac: I mean that’s how it should be lol
[2:44:54] dyllbarx: it was bugged
[2:44:54] chazzwozzers: why should you be able to kill grounding totems without targeting it?
[2:45:07] cyborg1141: rukiCool
[2:45:16] fazedoritoss: cuz u can toss grounding totem behind pillars its not fair
[2:45:22] rainmannxz: Pog hellofresh

[2:45:40] dyllbarx: That's how grounding has always worked
[2:45:43] freshdots321: I literally bolted people in the face seeing a grounding behind a pillar
[2:45:46] dyllbarx: it was just bugged
[2:45:49] Falcanus: ya it was bugged
[2:45:57] dyllbarx: wotlk/cata

[2:46:06] freshdots321: LMFAOO
[2:46:08] fazedoritoss: yea thats how i remember it working too
[2:46:12] fazedoritoss: it absorbed a spell
[2:46:14] dyllbarx: grounding totem in wotlk/cata had a very low cd
[2:46:15] fazedoritoss: and then disappears
[2:46:23] dyllbarx: grounding has been the same ever since mop @fazedoritoss
[2:46:58] skez_live: Ven I think your mog needs like a leather vest
[2:47:00] dyllbarx: last time it worked on one spell it was wotlk/cata and it had a 15 second cd back then
[2:47:15] RileyArmageddon: this tmog was definitely a choice xD

[2:48:40] mrxilio: @Roxxybolts haha
[2:48:41] Magottx: I feel like i wouldnt like that. i feel so weird at new setups always
[2:48:41] gelatokush: whos going there
[2:48:47] skez_live: would be sick if the EU team decided to fly DC just for the games for insane ping lol
[2:48:52] MaximumnNeo: liquid has a gaming facility

[2:49:45] storm_chaser_ron: nailed it
[2:49:49] Roxxybolts: imagine not living on east coast NA
[2:49:56] gelatokush: tourny realm are west coats tho
[2:50:01] Roxxybolts: renting my room to whaazler and raiku
[2:50:02] Badasti: lmao
[2:50:09] orbiitz269: most accurate map i've seen

[2:50:49] Axtin: ya east coast has like 100 ping on eu
[2:50:52] Roxxybolts: I got 120 in SC on euro
[2:50:55] iRarityz: you dont go on eu servers when from na?
[2:50:56] eceria: what is this drawing dude...
[2:51:00] ManaoKungPao: Really surprising they don't just use the east coast server
[2:51:05] zerx_gg: i have 14 ping on EU KKona
[2:51:12] Roxxybolts: compared to 200 from cali
[2:51:14] clicket: @ManaoKungPao there is no east coast server
[2:51:17] gelatokush: doesnt matter the server is hosted in west coast cali, Raiku ask Blizz if they could host tourny realms on east coast to make it more fair even out the ping an apparently blizz said they could do it but they wont
[2:51:20] Roxxybolts: 200 ms is unplayable as a caster
[2:51:29] Magottx: anytime im not 20 ms i blame losing on ping
[2:51:31] driftwood_tc: @clicket there definitely is an eastcoast server, atleast for classic.
[2:51:38] nameyourform: come heal me and a frost dk in 3s while we be toxic and smoke people. bring procpooperrrr @venruki
[2:51:42] Badasti: @Roxxybolts its bad as melee too, you kick and by the time it registers your target is out of range
[2:51:46] clicket: @driftwood_tc the datacenters are in LA and Chicago
[2:52:55] ManaoKungPao: hot streak?

[2:53:13] TheNutcracka: he lost 40 rounds
[2:53:13] FlowerJon: poor dude
[2:53:14] Cocoapuffs1: they barely reset mmr
[2:53:14] Badasti: i think each round is 6 right? so thats only like 6 shuffles or something
[2:53:17] driftwood_tc: probably farming gear for feral or boomie as resto?
[2:53:17] FlowerJon: gonna have a bad time

[2:54:40] fazedoritoss: and if ur a fresh char and u mess up placements ur just stuck in that bracket
[2:54:44] headnsoldiers1: how is his sigil rrange big?

[3:44:35] storm_chaser_ron: the popcorn bucket thing is so stupid
[3:44:35] Saitistreamy: dussy
[3:44:38] hamsti: OMEGALUL
[3:44:38] Cocoapuffs1: more like a lid
[3:44:48] storm_chaser_ron: no no im sure those are completely clean
[3:44:52] xGriefxGodx: The popcorn sphincter
[3:45:13] nameyourform: i need one of those... no one ask why

[3:46:59] zerocharisma1875: any announcement on the end of the season?
[3:47:01] bransby09: AFI <3
[3:47:49] oscrtv: how are u 50k dps as dh
[3:47:51] oscrtv: XD
[3:47:57] oscrtv: ok there we go
[3:49:45] zombieDolfin: the fact that you can dispell that.... lol
[3:50:14] thisisthotcaller: what was the end result of your aug adventures last week?
[3:50:21] ferahgok: @oscrtv It's so he can use the other 100k dps this game for EVEN MORE damage baby!
[3:51:51] nameyourform: rewind is the most useless ability in pvp lol
[3:51:52] Cocoapuffs1: this ret is pumpin
[3:52:05] Jihnn: Ret Paladin Army is on its way rukiMad
[3:52:07] IrishEthics: no he didnt
[3:52:12] IrishEthics: details tracks dmg to pets
[3:52:32] thewy: @IrishEthics there is 1 pet in the game
[3:52:34] galdinator: are u saying dh doesnt do damage to pets? lmfao
[3:52:38] zodiAken: DH braindeadly fun
[3:53:53] IrishEthics: hunter is on rets team and rets damage is lower
[3:53:56] IrishEthics: by a margin
[3:54:06] KralHor: DH feels like class from different game
[3:54:26] telen46: probably due more to clones than lack of pet cleave
[3:54:36] galdinator: let him do his rival math LUL
[3:54:59] ramenxo: im playing enshrouded and literally digging a hole in the ground for a secret tunnel
[3:55:04] ramenxo: more fun than wow pvp atm for me
[3:55:09] macdeezyx: how many order of hello fresh do you do a week?
[3:55:28] ramenxo: you know why? no dhs in this tunnel, no rdruids spam cloning me in this tunnel

[3:55:46] Reminosity: I don't understand this class it doesn't look like you're doing much and the numbers arent huge but your dmg meter says otherwise.. Mostly cleave dmg or what?
[3:56:21] vert_bh: Hey!
[3:56:57] StromicusRex: streamer turned into a horse
[3:57:05] KralHor: Wohoohohoh
[3:57:05] Reminosity: you pressed 1 button and he was half health 2 more and he's at like 15% I really don't understand where it's coming from
[3:57:11] galdinator: woahhhh lil illi
[3:57:28] KralHor: That's what dh does tu your brain maybe? LUL
[3:57:41] vert_bh: is this game worth trying?
[3:58:10] Cocoapuffs1: @Reminosity blade dance is their hardest hitting ability with ~8 sec cd, cleaves and applies ms
[3:58:13] SweatyDaniels: druid needed to heal more ther
[3:58:15] wyldeshock: smooth like sand
[3:58:19] Listarn: Anyhow you can share your nameplate profile? looks amazing
[3:58:20] Cocoapuffs1: and glaive throw xD
[3:58:40] driftwood_tc: Shameless DH enjoyer peepoWeird
[3:58:55] Reminosity: @Cocoapuffs1 Ok thank you I needed to hear that Im going crazy
[3:59:00] galdinator: i feel like such an idiot for not just abusing fotm every patch
[3:59:11] aragarde: LOL
[3:59:23] ladoraTV: no turtle lol
[3:59:26] ramenxo: hes a survival hunter i assure you he can just fall over dead like that
[3:59:30] b1det: i swear i heard a turkey
[3:59:31] Cocoapuffs1: @Reminosity yeah the throw glaive that it procs also increase dam taken
[3:59:38] gritngrind81: where that 13m at
[3:59:41] Cocoapuffs1: its legit like 4-5 abilities in 1 button
[3:59:45] aragarde: secret patch contains dk rework mhmmm
[4:00:23] Bigmoran: Dead to Eye Beam maximum disrespect
[4:00:23] Reminosity: >>>
[4:00:26] chuckgnaw: lilpissgo
[4:00:28] vert_bh: this game looks super cool but idk if should even try because it looks very complicated is it worth trying?
[4:00:30] galdinator: was that even a game
[4:00:30] gritngrind81: yikes lol
[4:00:50] sestren: I liked it when they decided that demon hunters weren't having enough fun so they made eye beam uninterruptible LUL
[4:01:21] anon9753: he just doesn't want to talk to a dh
[4:01:40] Reminosity: send it
[4:01:59] Reminosity: ...
[4:01:59] swolecolemole: bro
[4:02:01] waelrick: LUL
[4:02:03] Listarn: Huh?
[4:02:05] swolecolemole: nerf it into the ground, burn it with fire
[4:02:07] Lamatastisch: Buff DK Madge
[4:02:07] ManaoKungPao: disgusting
[4:02:08] drdoomkinx: is that guy geared XD
[4:02:11] LUIGY_3: @silent5325 ofc it is worth. it looks complicated because you never try it. but once you learn something about game its not that complicated
[4:02:12] Reminosity: rerolling tonight tbh
[4:02:13] KralHor: Pathetic
[4:02:16] driftwood_tc: Looked weak, needs a buff
[4:02:17] frost4mournee: Nerf it
[4:02:19] drdoomkinx: he is LUL
[4:02:23] soddi: thats why i have to trinket every 40 seconds against dh
[4:02:25] Badasti: chaos strike hits harder after meta from eyebeam as well i think right
[4:02:26] Listarn: Yea, but nerf chill streak for sure
[4:02:30] dmgcurry: make sense =) illidan wouldve done the same to these dks
[4:02:35] vert_bh: @LUIGY_3 been waiting for someone to answer i will give it a shot thank you!
[4:02:39] CKBandit: thats without arena ilvl bonus but point still stands
[4:02:42] KralHor: Buff fire mage
[4:02:42] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:02:44] Axtin: what was that random 100k at the end of ur dmg
[4:02:50] zodiAken: Totally balanced
[4:02:54] frost4mournee: Buff frosts they sucks
[4:03:13] unysub: whats ur talent build?
[4:03:21] drdoomkinx: goldrin used to hit 100k and it got a 60% nerf
[4:03:33] aragarde: secret frost dk rework in patch thats hidden
[4:03:34] ATHLTE: cuz demon kings Kappa
[4:03:35] aragarde: kekw
[4:03:37] ramenxo: at this point with dh you should be asking why not
[4:03:47] Magottx: Why does blade dance have 20 different passives that pump
[4:04:14] Reminosity: who thought this was a good idea!?
[4:04:21] Phobikinesis: buff DH
[4:04:24] aragarde: passives means less button bloat
[4:04:25] themanw1thaplan: so many buttons
[4:04:26] Cocoapuffs1: blade dance does way too much for being 1 button
[4:04:27] figurines: No DH's on SoD
[4:04:29] ferahgok: Basically my every single boomy lobby experience this patch
[4:04:35] stealthwalker99: I find (sophic (2 weapons) OR trinket) on essence break are even more scary it legit 1 shots
[4:04:40] KralHor: DK rework is secret for multiple months in a row, nothing mew
[4:04:47] Magottx: Actually makes me want to quit… like literally tho. SoD I guess
[4:05:02] stealthwalker99: trinket proc'ed there
[4:05:08] nameyourform: #makemoreclasseslikeDH
[4:05:09] stealthwalker99: trinket+soph proc == gg
[4:05:09] Bwrecker: qoe btw
[4:05:10] ATHLTE: skillz
[4:05:16] Bwrecker: aoe*
[4:05:17] Applezbtw: should be 100% buff dh plz
[4:05:18] ferahgok: Insane
[4:05:29] jroe034: whats inner demon?
[4:05:32] Axtin: then add a destro lock with that
[4:05:35] Axtin: extra piss
[4:05:38] figurines: @Magottx that and the communicated dev changes
[4:05:38] KralHor: Buff all classes on the same lvl and no problem
[4:05:39] aragarde: i mean sub rogues do the same but with more stuns
[4:05:50] aragarde: only because outlaw outshines right now
[4:05:51] Telarius1: He has like 16% versa, so not as accurate as it would be vs most
[4:05:55] thisisthotcaller: did your aug / dh games end up going well earlier in the week?
[4:05:58] Telarius1: DH is OP, but this matters
[4:06:24] Juliio29: Juliio29 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[4:06:24] Listarn: wat
[4:06:25] Cocoapuffs1: i love that combo
[4:06:30] psychxsp: fun little combo
[4:06:31] stealthwalker99: try to get soph+trinket proc then do it
[4:06:36] iTzKraynos: they're so easy to slow tho
[4:06:36] thecandyshopowner: Good afternoon ven, How are you feeling about FURY WARR in arena?
[4:06:46] dave9three: demon hunters are pissed rn
[4:06:46] aragarde: so the people that die to that aren't really aware of what to use defensives on though however?
[4:07:01] Telarius1: ok ok i just see alot of rdruids complain about being 1shot by everything and they have like 17% versa lmao
[4:07:02] SweatyDaniels: this is propaganda
[4:07:05] Telarius1: Bigmoran has 13% out of pvp
[4:07:13] Magottx: Dude this is genuinely depressing… its so simple too man
[4:07:23] LUIGY_3: g
[4:07:28] aragarde: because people can avoid it if they know how the opener goes
[4:07:38] Saitistreamy: so glad blizzard decided to fix mmr this season, its just weird I have to level a DH to do it
[4:07:54] aragarde: you level a dh because everyone else is doing it, you don't have to lol
[4:07:58] Applezbtw: dual a DH to see how much less damage they take
[4:08:02] KralHor: U can't avoid it every 40 sec though
[4:08:07] aragarde: fotm people smh
[4:08:39] Saitistreamy: why struggle to climb, when you can just play the broken class
[4:08:46] stealthwalker99: trinket proc fell off
[4:08:49] McLarge: Trinket proc also fell pretty early in the combo
[4:08:51] Axtin: insig proc is bigger than double sophic
[4:09:02] figurines: Stop advertising for SoD
[4:09:14] Reminosity: ^ lol
[4:09:20] aragarde: so basically saying if its super easy to climb using one spec everyone should reroll? I play evoker and climbed with all the dhs around because i know how to shut or run away from their goes
[4:09:21] Magottx: Actual higher burst than sub with 1/10 the buttons
[4:09:26] Telarius1: I get dh is op, but im pretty sure any class would do this to a druid with 15% versa\
[4:09:26] aragarde: you don't have to reroll to fotm classes
[4:09:37] dizzydirtyg: they die in stuns, its clearly not op
[4:09:43] soddi: but a ww fist of fury => crane proc => rsk is 100=>0 as well, isn't it?
[4:09:47] Applezbtw: find a dh
[4:09:50] Telarius1: Well what i said was any other class would prob delete them 2
[4:09:53] Saitistreamy: @aragarde why work harder?
[4:09:56] Telarius1: Not that it wouldnt happen
[4:10:05] anon9753: save the DHsplaining for someone else
[4:10:09] Axtin: @Telarius1 ya but if the druid is playing thick hide (he prob is) then he has 6% extra dmg reduction which is the same as an extra 12% vers
[4:10:29] aragarde: I don't have to work harder if i know what they do? just learn to avoid them and you win lol, why add to the epidemic of dhs

[4:10:37] Telarius1: way slower.
[4:10:44] CKBandit: Do you think that DHs have an extraordinary amount of apologists, or do people rush to defend any strong class?
[4:10:44] Cephqt: this is awful
[4:10:50] everlivingquinnviewer: dh player spotted LUL
[4:10:53] ferahgok: @Telarius1 And yet, still too fast every 40 seconds
[4:10:53] dragonslay3r_blaz3r: nothing about DH is fair. nerf it to the grouond
[4:10:53] Cephqt: this is worse than rets in 10.1.5
[4:10:58] Telarius1: Idk why people hating when its just a consistancy thing lol
[4:11:11] Telarius1: People so anti-dh brained no matter what lmfao
[4:11:16] McLarge: You can one shot anybody like this. You'd showcase the same thing on a training dummy with any class. I bet if you logged WW and tried to one shot Bigmoran under the same circumstances, you'd do it just as easily
[4:11:18] Kujo_XX: @aragarde The data says your experience is an outlier.
[4:11:19] Juliio29: I’m about to reroll my ret lol
[4:11:19] kand1nsky: now do frostbomb flurry ray
[4:11:26] everlivingquinnviewer: we get it bro u main dh @Telarius1
[4:11:27] psychxsp: Yeah
[4:11:29] psychxsp: keep coping dhs
[4:11:30] GiiGa07: Lol
[4:11:31] psychxsp: lol
[4:11:34] Badasti: @Telarius1 you have to be high to say this isnt way over the top though
[4:11:37] Lugges48: does bladedance trigger innerdemon aswell?
[4:11:41] justjoshingyo: Funny thing is dhs were nerted 4x. And people still want more nerfs. The Stas got higher and people got full gear  ....nerf destro imo!!!
[4:11:49] kand1nsky: im just trolling :)
[4:11:54] aragarde: i have like 4 dhs in my guild that are easily dealt with after practice but you're right @Kujo_XX
[4:11:54] Badasti: dispell bomb, kick ray lol
[4:11:58] Juliio29: versatility doesn’t matter against DH
[4:12:01] galdinator: Yea.. u gotta be in melee range to eye beam
[4:12:02] Banwellx: Yea frost bomb ray is way more broken
[4:12:03] Banwellx: KEKW
[4:12:05] aragarde: my experience allows me to learn so i know what to avoid.. an outlier for sure
[4:12:05] HoGoFroGo: 40 sec cd lol
[4:12:07] galdinator: Dont need to be in melee range for frost bomb
[4:12:10] swolecolemole: one has a cast, can be kicked or dispelled...the other is instant and clean one shots every 40 sec
[4:12:13] pwntrd: don't even need to kick ray, just dispell and it won't crit anymore
[4:12:17] dave9three: you dont even need to target the guy to do it
[4:12:20] demololtv: DH kids crying now that your exposing them
[4:12:20] skooovs: Demonhunter is balanced :)
[4:12:21] zodiAken: Copium :D
[4:12:28] ferahgok: and it can cleave lol
[4:12:31] drewafloyd: LOL. Dh's all butthurt
[4:12:33] gritngrind81: its disgusting
[4:12:34] galdinator: Isnt frost bomb 15 seconds and 40y range?
[4:12:34] iTzKraynos: you can slow them easily
[4:12:35] Interzention: imagine if serenity was up every 40 seconds
[4:12:39] kh9911: this dhs rolf
[4:12:40] joyrex_j9: demon hunter is just fun to play it isn't overpowered
[4:12:43] wowsuomi: Play rogue
[4:12:43] kand1nsky: al least eyebeam is a big telegraph
[4:12:43] kh9911: Kappa Kappa
[4:12:43] shugguls: wish my warrior warbreaker was like this
[4:12:45] aragarde: you can slow and root them
[4:12:47] dmgcurry: but theres so much skills involved in this
[4:12:47] peeachy8: leave the zoomers alone!
[4:12:57] Kujo_XX: @aragarde Cool, but you're ignoring the data. DH's place in the data is a function of the ease with which it over performs. Cool story you can avoid them, but not really the point.
[4:12:58] aragarde: literally the easiest thing but people break roots and thus they do whatever they want
[4:12:59] unysub: i usually disarm after they use essence break
[4:13:06] Axtin: theres a reason 90% of arena games have a dh
[4:13:09] Telarius1: Ya its hard to avoid and ontop of that, Chaotic Dispositon random RNG 28% more dam
[4:13:09] anon9753: all the 1500 players that are currently 2400 on their DH's in shuffle say it's fine and everyone can do that
[4:13:11] SweatyDaniels: People trashing DH even though the main reason for Dh being higher rated on average is due to the higher skill level of those who play it. I've never seen a noob play Dh to a high level. Yes it has easy learning curve, but insane skill cap, even more than sub rogue imho
[4:13:13] McLarge: It's a 4s duration modifier, you can absolutely avoid it by peeling. The only way you can't avoid it is if your entire team is locked down
[4:13:43] iRarityz: this guy is delusional
[4:13:45] lightsflux: wow people are pretty dull lmao
[4:13:50] Badasti: all these dh players think that the great wall of dh in stats is because dh players are just more skilled on average LUL
[4:13:53] Banwellx: at least DH doesn't have much CC so they can't lock down the whole team by themselves
[4:13:55] pwntrd: you can secure deathsweep with glimpse so its not even stoppable
[4:13:57] phanabananana: Lets be real the reason dh is broken is their dispelling themselves all game
[4:13:58] Cephqt: LOL THIS FUCKING GUY!!!! DH is unkiteable unpeelable
[4:13:59] Cephqt: jesus
[4:13:59] Telarius1: @anon9753 i dont think anyone says that. Its more like 99% just people brainlessly spewing dh op over and over. Its op everyone knows
[4:14:04] ivolzi: chat be like i finally hit 1800 for the first time bc dh i dont want to see it nerfed
[4:14:05] Ignite_CLO: any ele sham god in chat that knows what the hell to do when you get tunneled by 2 meeles all game
[4:14:08] Saitistreamy: @SweatyDaniels top tier troll
[4:14:10] xGriefxGodx: Memewell is a DH enjoyer
[4:14:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @Ignite_CLO bend over mainly
[4:14:24] Cephqt: @Ignite_CLO use lube
[4:14:27] joyrex_j9: chill guys we'll get balance notes once they're done perfecting sod
[4:14:33] gritngrind81: nerf the tier and dh fixed
[4:14:34] everlivingquinnviewer: KEKW
[4:14:38] cadvan3: essence break is just a modifier for blade dance and  chaos strike. the actual hit isnt insane its the ability used after, it can be cced, and stopped. But that doesnt change the fact its OP af and need nerfed
[4:14:42] Applezbtw: just line of site
[4:14:44] aragarde: @Kujo_XX we already know they'll get hit with a nerf after the finals
[4:14:46] Phreshbrew: bUt We DiE iN sTuNs
[4:14:47] macciforum: they should nerf dh after i get glad xD
[4:14:49] everlivingquinnviewer: so balanced ConcernDoge
[4:14:51] Genruto: did you sawp gear or how come the big 100-0?
[4:14:52] galdinator: Bigmoran naked so he can post propaganda on twitter
[4:14:53] phanabananana: and they get to dispell themselves all game!!!!
[4:14:54] apaine27: What I can say is that it feels like every CC in the game hits a DH when you eye beam.
[4:14:55] Czade: 300 hundo thousand WutFace
[4:14:56] figurines: yeah but none of those crits are nerfed. DH is fine
[4:14:56] HoGoFroGo: and whats the cast time on blade dance? haha
[4:14:59] Saitistreamy: more damage then chaos bolt
[4:14:59] Reminosity: takes me 3 2 minutes cd's to hit half of that...
[4:15:05] Cephqt: remember the passive spell dmg reduction... like Spellwarden used to be
[4:15:09] MuchopowerTV: Not even a Chaos Bolt
[4:15:09] McLarge: Damage is not the reason DH is overpowered. I will not concede on that point. The game is already super slow at 2200+ in spite of this damage. The problem with DH is that it can't die
[4:15:09] peeachy8: @macciforum lol
[4:15:20] Blessedx: these dh mains are delusional man. just go look at ladder data if you want a clear picture of how strong DH is atm
[4:15:28] ATHLTE: hahahaha
[4:15:37] Telarius1: Chaotic Disposition makes Dh just delete you at random. Big problem
[4:15:39] Axtin: there can be multiple things that make a spec strong
[4:15:43] ramenxo: dh damage is 100% a problem as well
[4:15:50] heymomimonttv: dh has 3 immunes, unlimited mobility. its broken
[4:15:50] ramenxo: i dont have a single ability on any spec of hunter that can hit for 300k
[4:15:51] zodiAken: Plus you only meet DH in every lobby
[4:15:54] TrippThree: AND they still wont push out nay patch updates about this......
[4:16:00] donnydonawitzz: blizzard has been silent on pvp changes for quite some time now
[4:16:04] macciforum: yes its super obvious in solo shuffle
[4:16:04] simstarx: if it wasn't 45 cd at least
[4:16:06] shogun2022: if they nerfed blade dance giving them 100% dodge it might fix things a bit that or nerf blur
[4:16:06] Cephqt: people who refuse to admit DH is good got their first Elite this season... as DH
[4:16:10] nameyourform: nerf ret tbh
[4:16:11] ramenxo: dh as a class is cool, just not this iteration of dh.
[4:16:14] aragarde: the patch is hidden, i wouldn't expect people to see anything related to nerfs until march at the earliest
[4:16:19] SweatyDaniels: im pretty sure the double DH procpooper shuffle earlier shows that the game isn't always slow
[4:16:20] AlphasaurusRexx: @McLarge ill concede to this. i wouldnt care if i can outplay the burst and return the favor. but i straight up cant
[4:16:26] macciforum: and dh/ldestro is insane in 3s but hard to play well, also ele/arms shit on dh/lock
[4:16:28] Badasti: i do, dh is like a class with training wheels
[4:16:28] aragarde: after the awc we definitely will see nerfs
[4:16:31] Juliio29: I think blizz leaves OP things alone just to give people shit to complain about imo
[4:16:38] shogun2022: Dhs do die tho, we just accept the narrative they dont die
[4:16:44] aragarde: so if people are upset about it just wait till the awc and bam all is resolved
[4:16:47] Interzention: they should buff the classes that kill dh like ww and feral :)
[4:16:48] galdinator: the narrative LUL
[4:16:51] zpz3: DH’s are ugly
[4:16:55] Telarius1: not true @shogun2022
[4:16:55] shogun2022: been targetting them more and its working a lot
[4:17:01] Badasti: jesus the cope
[4:17:07] Juliio29: Ven can you see what im typing?
[4:17:11] shogun2022: im just saying more from personal experience because you get all these lock DH teams
[4:17:15] Telarius1: Soul fragment healing literally spams u 100-190k per fragment and its free since patch
[4:17:16] kh9911: anyone main dh 0 iq no flame ofc Kappa
[4:17:27] simstarx: Ven can you see what im typing?
[4:17:29] shogun2022: you can go lock and accept a million ports or go dh and just get through his defensives
[4:17:32] AlphasaurusRexx: @venruki can you change segments and see how fast you can die as a enh shaman
[4:17:40] Telarius1: Like ven, use Blood moon, press purge, ull see the healing it does. Chaos strike can proc it too
[4:17:45] McLarge: DH does not die. I'm a DH main, have been for several years, the only way a DH dies is if they try to just face tank damage in between Blur windows
[4:18:07] figurines: mark of the wild for 3% more versa!
[4:18:12] Texdizzle: hes kicking your ass
[4:18:33] Axtin: bigmoran missing some hp he should have almost 1.3mil in bear
[4:18:48] Interzention: you lost the mastery from embellish
[4:18:49] SweatyDaniels: KILLKILLKILLL
[4:19:00] galdinator: bigmoran took off his rings so he can use these clips as anti dh propaganda on twitter
[4:19:05] waelrick: LUL  󠀀
[4:19:07] DaneDillon: Kreygasm
[4:19:09] ATHLTE: 48% vers lol
[4:19:24] TrippThree: But its not a "one shot".
[4:19:31] anon9753: just get 80% versa and DH is fine
[4:19:31] SweatyDaniels: hE diDnT uSE baRKSkIN tHaTS NoT a FaIR ComPARiSoN
[4:19:32] Badasti: dh dam so low, they just live long Kappa
[4:19:34] Cephqt: @venruki whats worse. 10.2.5 DH or 10.1.5 Ret?
[4:19:35] ATHLTE: no damp either
[4:19:47] driftwood_tc: @Cephqt HmmMeeting
[4:19:58] aragarde: ret, it needed huge nerfs if i recall
[4:20:01] Telarius1: its way overtuned
[4:20:03] aragarde: lol like weekly
[4:20:08] thisisthotcaller: did your aug / dh games end up going well earlier in the week?
[4:20:10] Telarius1: Since we got x2 the hunt leech uptime now as well + free soul frag
[4:20:10] Juliio29: just imagine another person hitting you with that burst lol
[4:20:10] cornflakes_au_getchop: evening / moring !
[4:20:13] figurines: how high can you take x3 DH?
[4:20:13] cornflakes_au_getchop: how are you doing today
[4:20:16] Telarius1: Yes
[4:20:17] macciforum: its kinda funny, cause remember how strong dh was start of season
[4:20:26] McLarge: The Hunt does a good amount of healing, yes
[4:20:36] Telarius1: Essentiall, HUnt Leech perma free 10% now. And cuz of 4 set, double uptime since last patch.
[4:20:42] Telarius1: Then you add 180k soul fragments ontop of that.
[4:20:47] heymomimonttv: @macciforum nothings changed!! everyone else got nerfs but dh stayed the same :)
[4:21:19] Telarius1: no shot
[4:21:25] macciforum: they do
[4:21:31] Telarius1: if DH didnt get nerfed x3 in a row start of patch, They'd legit delte u in 0.000001 sec
[4:21:41] macciforum: first few weeks dh was above and beyond
[4:21:42] Axtin: they have a bunch of pvp nerfs
[4:21:44] Telarius1: They got several nerfs
[4:21:53] kand1nsky: Why not Kappa
[4:21:56] Telarius1: This is nerfed DH, and its still insane.
[4:22:00] McLarge: Chaos Strike didn't do good damage earlier this expansion

[4:22:34] Telarius1: @McLarge more like all the xpac, it was more worth to just press throw glaive in almost any scenario LOL
[4:22:46] peeachy8: @aragarde ret still needs a bit of nerfs, I almost tripled the other dps in solo q. I even told the shaman I didn't know what the fuck I was doing, which was true. the shaman just laughed and said yup. went 5-6 my first time in greens
[4:22:47] Telarius1: Cheaper fury, more dam, and aoe
[4:23:04] im_nandy: whats Ven reading?
[4:23:13] Telarius1: Its missing some nerfs too.
[4:23:27] iTarnish_: do you think blizzard will nerf dh more  ?
[4:23:28] Telarius1: Its missing some of the nerfs from start of this patch. Despite that dh is still op
[4:23:31] McLarge: If nothing was nerfed, you'd have Dragonflight release DH
[4:23:37] kh9911: nerf them more we dont want see any dh in arena
[4:23:38] Salanzo: Yooooo
[4:23:43] McLarge: Which was way more broken than DH is now
[4:23:44] Telarius1: People not remembering fel barrage deleteing everything 0.00001 sec
[4:23:58] swolecolemole: @peeachy8 how does ret need nerfs based off a 1600 shuffle?
[4:24:10] Telarius1: Ya we did
[4:24:10] McLarge: Yes, they did
[4:24:16] ramenxo: beginning of season my first arena was vs sleepihead and 2 dhs that did 500k dps to us each and wiped my entire team through rewind + communion instantly
[4:24:19] Telarius1: And it healed you 50% your hp
[4:24:19] McLarge: It was still Lay on Hands too
[4:24:20] ramenxo: that version of dh was nerfed
[4:24:21] Telarius1: Scaled with Versa
[4:24:22] aragarde: i miss that one
[4:24:31] aragarde: i think that was more fair in damage then current iteration
[4:24:31] shogun2022: gave you a dmg buff too
[4:24:33] shogun2022: I think
[4:24:37] Telarius1: They removed that, bug gave you demonic appitite passively.
[4:24:42] McLarge: This is far from the most broken the spec has ever been
[4:24:47] Telarius1: But*
[4:24:54] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy walaw03 WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[4:25:01] Telarius1: Aka, removed the Demon heal, but gave you passive soul fragments on chaos strike

[4:25:42] Saitistreamy: is your graphics card a ti86?
[4:25:44] satirically1: absterge plays with his game set to like 3 in the graphics lol
[4:25:46] itsallrngasf: but that is the gayest character I ever seen
[4:25:47] PsyqoSupreme: that mog is awesome, lol
[4:25:53] Badasti: i cant play wow with high graphics, it melts my brain
[4:25:53] McLarge: Does anyone remember Dragonflight pre-patch? That was the most broken iteration of DH by far imo. Soulrend ticking for 30K when people had 100K HP
[4:26:04] aragarde: he doesn't like cowboy mogs i think
[4:26:05] gaulois62: that look like a big dildo
[4:26:05] aragarde: lol
[4:26:17] Telarius1: Ven do you know about the Veng-Retreat bug? Ive been trying to get it known so people stop abusing
[4:26:18] GiiGa07: GIGACHAD imo
[4:26:25] Telarius1: And it gets fixed
[4:26:30] heymomimonttv: @Telarius1 elaborate pls
[4:26:50] Telarius1: If you meld, 0.01 sec, end of Veng retreat, after a double jump, about half the time you can keep the buff, immuning for 12-18seconds
[4:26:53] Bezoned: there's a good video for a command to get sharper graphic details, big difference :)
[4:27:00] Telarius1: Just immune to CC straight up
[4:27:07] Telarius1: Can also do it with Metamorphosis immunity
[4:27:11] aragarde: never heard of that one
[4:27:20] Telarius1: You've prob experienced it, alot of people abusing
[4:27:21] aragarde: but i have a belf sooo i've never used it
[4:27:25] Bigmoran: Is there a class DH doesn't synergize with in SS? Maybe Mage?
[4:27:28] Telarius1: I could make 1 prob
[4:27:34] heymomimonttv: huh that makes sense why i've seen 10 sec + immune DHs
[4:27:35] McLarge: @Bigmoran Hunter
[4:27:41] Telarius1: @Bigmoran Ypi
[4:27:43] ramenxo: hunter/dh is pretty bad
[4:27:44] Xeliumimar: i've been seeing ppl q arcane/dh on the ladder
[4:27:46] McLarge: DH hates playing with Hunter in SS
[4:27:51] Salanzo: i bet fire/arcane mage DH is nice
[4:27:53] obviouslytai: NERF NERF NERF
[4:27:55] Telarius1: @Bigmoran When DH is nerfed, you'll find out quickly it aint shiet with 99% of classes lmao
[4:27:58] LilSmashi: !youtubew
[4:28:01] LilSmashi: !youtube
[4:28:01] Moobot: @LilSmashi YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:28:07] stealthwalker99: That would actually explain so much I keep seeing people do veng-retreat and then live at 10 percent forever
[4:28:21] storm_chaser_ron: @Telarius1 a class being not ass is definitely a factor in synergy with anything else lol, kind of a duh statement no?
[4:28:21] galdinator: telarius u are so bad with numbers LUL
[4:28:26] odikwow: whats your honest opinion on Jaybeezy DH skills compared to other AWC DH players?
[4:28:26] Telarius1: @stealthwalker99  ^ yup
[4:28:33] aragarde: nightelf bug
[4:28:36] obviouslytai: blizzards fault not theirs
[4:28:38] Telarius1: Its hella abused already, and recently got spread around
[4:28:48] sethv805: what is the bug?
[4:29:02] Telarius1: Luckily you cant just do it unless you time it right but its not insanely hard
[4:29:03] storm_chaser_ron: @obviouslytai not abusing obvious bugs is definitely a player fault too lol
[4:29:21] obviouslytai: @storm_chaser_ron u think? how long has it been in the game?
[4:29:45] Xeliumimar: whats the bug
[4:29:47] thisisthotcaller: wait, what is this bug?
[4:29:53] Telarius1: @storm_chaser_ron Its Type of CCs, and duration of CC's, dont synergize with many classes.
[4:30:08] obviouslytai: bottom line is people will always abuse things in the game. if blizzard cared it would  and should be removed. cant hate the player imo
[4:30:10] storm_chaser_ron: yes, people are referring to its synergies *now*
[4:30:23] storm_chaser_ron: @obviouslytai you can hate both 100%
[4:30:45] Telarius1: dh dosent synergize with much, its just broken a.f rn so it just deletes
[4:31:09] storm_chaser_ron: Not every fix is a trivial 2second  change, like changing macros
[4:31:16] Telarius1: Thats not the best for damage
[4:31:22] storm_chaser_ron: which is why ppl caught bans for kick macro
[4:31:26] TrippThree: It doesnt matter.... DH is the baby one button class....
[4:31:40] kh9911: @TrippThree true 100%%%
[4:31:42] macciforum: @TrippThree xD
[4:31:43] obviouslytai: @storm_chaser_ron with the size of blizzard i strongly disagree. Everyone knows they have been neglecting wow for a while now
[4:31:45] kh9911: just 123
[4:31:46] Telarius1: Meta uptime, thats about it
[4:32:02] Telarius1: Both other variants do more overall dam, but DH dam is so overwhelming, you dont really need the extra.
[4:32:13] Telarius1: So you go that for best surviability/consistancy
[4:33:07] stealthwalker99: You should find a night elf dh to test the bug after. I've seen so many dh's do that but never knew why until now
[4:33:08] Moobot: Latest video "Is The War Within DEAD ALREADY? Venruki Reacts" view it here: youtu.be/hnyq8-kzFJk
[4:33:14] Dark_Wave1: @venruki I don’t remember, but did you ever compete against Snutz and the boys back in 2015/2016? it’s been years, was going through old blizzcon merch I have.
[4:33:30] donnydonawitzz: playing ranged in solo shuffle... lol
[4:34:00] swishoriginal: Ven play monk or i riot
[4:34:05] swishoriginal: pls
[4:34:23] Telarius1: Similar playstyle, just you do more dam overall, but you'll lose that metauptime/leech. The double immo Variant is more for self-dispeling/single target maxing
[4:34:26] ZealotryTV: @swishoriginal this is a DH stream
[4:34:36] swishoriginal: i cry
[4:34:50] swishoriginal: im kidding, ill enjoy and shut my ASS UP
[4:35:10] ZealotryTV: the visual noise of evokers is both impressive and annoying
[4:35:22] Telarius1: BEkAzqt9tQbK6xteCyjwasgfTKJRIJkIJiECJAAAAAAgUCRSkk0SSapkSESCiWjkEB      same build, but more damage overall, you sacrifice Chaos Nova duration
[4:35:28] Telarius1: my fave version
[4:37:28] McLarge: Isolated Prey
[4:38:10] Telarius1: ya if u hit someone solo with chaos nova, its 5 sec stun instead
[4:38:19] Telarius1: but if u aint doin that, u gaining no value anyways
[4:38:24] McLarge: You're also dropping Chaotic Transformation
[4:38:28] McLarge: Interesting
[4:38:43] galdinator: HmmMeeting
[4:38:53] Telarius1: ya
[4:38:57] Telarius1: i prefer the pump
[4:39:00] McLarge: Mvq has that same build he plays into some matchups, but he drops Shattered Destiny instead of Chaotic Transformation
[4:39:09] Telarius1: ya, i drop shattered as well
[4:39:13] Telarius1: Guess who gave him that build
[4:39:16] McLarge: He calls it "max PvE build"
[4:39:22] Telarius1: on his stream
[4:39:24] Telarius1: lmao
[4:39:28] tim786: what ability are you using to kill pysfiend i sware it takes like 5 abilities to kill it
[4:39:35] Telarius1: shattered is a moveable point.
[4:39:45] odikwow: NOOO
[4:40:02] thisisthotcaller: who is 0 so far?
[4:40:04] tigerslap_ow: man, how are you enjoying this weather? :)
[4:40:24] tigerslap_ow: its like +7 in Edmonton right now
[4:40:26] Telarius1: he woulda figured it out on his own eventually tho, not like its complicated
[4:40:30] McLarge: You're sacrificing some upfront damage for Burning Wound basically

[4:40:43] Telarius1: Ya
[4:41:03] Telarius1: Only takes about 25 seconds for this build to take over the other for dam
[4:41:30] thisisthotcaller: still top dam and youve been cc'ed into oblivion the whole game hahahaha
[4:41:39] poasa21: dang!
[4:41:46] malvarcla: how hard did that hit
[4:42:02] McLarge: 70-0'd
[4:42:23] tigerslap_ow: have the servers been okay today?
[4:42:25] BrightfishTV: every time i login to see your stream i see u kiss the microphone
[4:42:32] BrightfishTV: <3
[4:43:01] Telarius1: "Dropped darkness to protect him from the light" vs a ret
[4:43:03] Telarius1: LMAO
[4:43:04] eygton: die a hero or live long enough to become a demon hunter
[4:43:11] Slayer_Eagleone: wow
[4:43:30] thisisthotcaller: did your aug games end up going well with the DH earlier this week?
[4:43:33] phanabananana: Yeah that was like anti Crusader roleplay
[4:43:46] Xawo87: log a lock on EU and play mlx with me lol
[4:43:55] babyman1st: Sometimes darkness can show you the light!
[4:44:02] ripzaddo: prot war
[4:44:06] thisisthotcaller: being called the on use trinket when you were playing aug was top tier
[4:44:09] riplockx: feral
[4:44:11] ripzaddo: probably LOL
[4:44:13] malvarcla: destro
[4:44:14] ramenxo: sv hunter doesnt really fit well into that comp, tried it last night at 2.2 and i just got my ass ran down all game and we had low cross
[4:44:19] McLarge: Vengeance DH Kappa
[4:44:27] ramenxo: felt like any other spec woulda been fine lol
[4:44:28] riplockx: How much for you to play feral a hole stream?
[4:44:30] TheFamilyHorde: Can you stream in the Last Epoch category so I can get drops but watch you?
[4:44:33] chizzad52: Reminds me of the old Rsham Prot pala disc priest
[4:44:44] morepewpew7: chat, what's the most fun class for shuffles in DF?
[4:44:49] Mechgyrasaur: wait I just thought of a comp
[4:44:50] malvarcla: not a whole stream, a hole stream
[4:44:57] Mechgyrasaur: fw/blood dk/dh KEKW
[4:45:19] Flip_Method: mute tab
[4:45:29] Kymagez: ?
[4:45:32] ripzaddo: for drops it works as a view
[4:45:34] thewired84: lol really
[4:45:38] TheFamilyHorde: OP
[4:45:44] ReyATL: any real lurker knows this :3
[4:46:22] Telarius1: I find its better for shuffle overall.
[4:46:26] Telarius1: You keep it.
[4:46:34] McLarge: You still play Inner Demon
[4:46:35] Badasti: its good if you are getting rooted i think, because you can play cleansed by flame
[4:46:38] Telarius1: You keep inner still.
[4:46:49] EmpStyle: I think you only play double immo when you need to dispel yourself constantly right?
[4:47:14] Telarius1: You can change Shattered Destiny, to something else.
[4:47:24] Telarius1: You lose Chaotic Transformation, and Isolated.
[4:47:29] McLarge: You lost Iso Prey and Chaotic Transformation
[4:47:29] TheFamilyHorde: Did you ever see that video on twitter about a battle royale mode for wow?
[4:47:30] Telarius1: However, you can put Shattered in 1 of those if you prefer.
[4:48:11] McLarge: You traded them for Burning Wound
[4:48:13] Draxxul: u lose  cycle of hatred and shattered destiny, for know your enemy  and a fire inside
[4:48:27] Telarius1: Your throw glaive spreads Burning wound everywhere.
[4:48:29] ripzaddo: double immolate seems needed tho no?
[4:48:30] McLarge: You traded up front damage for more DoT damage
[4:48:46] Telarius1: You can change Shattered Destiny, for Chaotic, it still works in the build.
[4:48:47] McLarge: You can drop Shattered Destiny for Chaotic Transformation if you want
[4:48:50] Telarius1: ^^^
[4:48:52] argalanmg: eye beam does less big dam than you think
[4:48:54] TheFamilyHorde: Is this the if you can't beat em join em stream?
[4:49:03] thendj: you get get double blade dance in your essence break window with that taelnt too
[4:49:15] Telarius1: Shattered isnt the biggest deal ever.
[4:49:15] moremantella255: just look at murloc and see what 99 percent of people use
[4:49:26] Telarius1: Especially in a shuffle.
[4:49:36] McLarge: This is a max PvE dam build
[4:49:42] McLarge: Probably good in Shuffle
[4:49:45] Telarius1: yep
[4:49:51] moremantella255: chaotic transformation is great
[4:49:54] Telarius1: i use it to edge over other dhs lmfao
[4:49:58] McLarge: Mvq plays it into Ret/Warr/FW I think
[4:50:19] MaximumnNeo: i just 30 points for a 5-1 as healer, and the other healer had more mmr than me
[4:50:22] MaximumnNeo: ???
[4:51:59] moremantella255: another war within is dead clip pikabooDent pikabooDent
[4:52:15] Kymagez: to much cheese?

[4:55:45] mudcx: mortal strike has a lot of damage mods but they are all nerfed by 90% in pvp so nothing u do actually matters
[4:55:51] Airitreya: mortal strike having 4 different values that are all invisible to the enemy and to some extend myself is lame
[4:56:02] riplockx: Even if the war within is dead, Everyone that is talking about it will still play the game

[4:57:19] Vixizfx: @Salanzo 200k ms where
[4:57:28] pharmztko: reactception
[4:57:37] Salanzo: as a cloth wearer i have been crit by MS for over 150k
[4:57:39] nameyourform: i mean thats better then a 3 button DH 1 shot
[4:57:41] BetterknownasJohn: @Vixizfx on DK's
[4:57:46] deadlycalm: Warrior modifiers do nothing
[4:57:59] jontepman: spells like Icy Veins should only give haste and not the random damage increase as well
[4:58:03] mudcx: @Salanzo cloth classes are plate valued targets now
[4:58:05] crypkin: full war mods hit for 180k ms and you got dh out here hitting 250k deathsweeps lol
[4:58:07] Badasti: are these hero specs replacing the normal ones? or can we still just play frost mage?
[4:58:09] Synckery: the most fun classes are usually where they have a simple dps rotation but has more fun cool utility and things it can do
[4:58:24] kand1nsky: every class should be as ez as DH?
[4:58:26] Armanous: is it possible to start playing the game as a brand new player right now? seems like there is a lot going on and very intimidating
[4:58:35] Badasti: i did
[4:58:36] tigerslap_ow: monk us fun.. 4 buttoms, boom done
[4:58:43] MalafisTV: I did
[4:58:43] Shad_WW: this is just a modern wow thing
[4:58:55] ngage44: melee must have had windfury totem
[4:59:01] orcrimmar: classic is 100000000% times more sweat than retail. Also asmon....blegh
[4:59:04] Synckery: this is a modern "gaming" issue where everyone wants to be a pro / perfect minimax etc
[4:59:04] waelrick: wrath is super sweaty, even sod was insane for a game when most of your damage comes from auto attack
[4:59:13] BlRDmanX: had to have buffs
[4:59:27] markeexy: asmon doomer takes oh noes
[4:59:28] Badasti: we got server firsts from SSC / TK to Sunwell... I rerolled an enhance shaman to totem twist, which means you dropped wf totem, then swapped it for an agi totem when the wf buff dropped on the melee group LUL
[4:59:41] Luigicamp: yeah, classic is just as bad. vanilla was more chill, the reboot was awful
[5:00:04] Badasti: you had to to beat the enrage timer on Brutalus, most guilds never got past that before TBC ended
[5:00:13] pharmztko: F EM
[5:00:16] waelrick: LUL
[5:00:21] moremantella255: blanky
[5:00:22] orcrimmar: asmon is the last person to talk about that. he got carried through every part of wow during his life.
[5:00:28] pharmztko: rukiBlankie
[5:00:32] zerotensai: rukiBlankie
[5:00:34] zodiAken: Sweater?!
[5:00:38] moremantella255: rukiBlankie rukiBlankie
[5:01:32] Luigicamp: lol
[5:01:36] TheBoysCT: RAID TAX
[5:01:36] waelrick: LUL  󠀀
[5:01:45] TheBoysCT: WHATI N THE CAPITALISM
[5:01:48] DoYouWannaHug: They provided us mats for raid with the tax though right?
[5:01:52] DoYouWannaHug: I forget was awhile ago.
[5:02:00] Shad_WW: @DoYouWannaHug was for tank cons
[5:02:10] DoYouWannaHug: ah ok and Dews hand of rag
[5:02:37] orcrimmar: that's why i stopped playing SoD during phase 1. why are people wanting you to have raid world buff + potions + pre-bis for BFD. you can legit clear it in full questing gear right as you hit 25
[5:02:52] pharmztko: DH only 2 hero specs :-(
[5:03:13] joyrex_j9: btw asmon loves poe for the insane layers of complexity
[5:03:13] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[5:03:29] krisdahaka: it's disgusting
[5:03:44] joyrex_j9: everything he says is always hypocritical when it's directed towards wow
[5:03:56] Badasti: funny thing is, even with all that shit its exactly the same as wow, there are cookie cutter specs that you play and the rest is dogshit
[5:03:56] waelrick: poe gameplay is super simple though. all the complex systems are from how you build your char
[5:03:57] belfastcl: @joyrex_j9 people don't play arpgs and mmos for the same reasons
[5:03:59] imrobk: last epoch is a good middle ground between Diablo and POE complexity wise
[5:04:02] krisdahaka: @joyrex_j9 how is he wrong?
[5:04:04] Rupeltinski: is not that hard to play wow come on.. people talk to much crap
[5:04:15] satirically1: didnt they say on the stage the way they are doing hero talents they are trying to build up the creep over the next 3 xpacs instead of every xpac?
[5:04:23] pestlerogue: yes
[5:04:23] tigerslap_ow: fuck yes
[5:04:23] ItsBees: yes
[5:04:24] peacant: no
[5:04:24] AlphasaurusRexx: @joyrex_j9 hes a WoW hate watcher now.
[5:04:24] VetisBR: not on dh
[5:04:25] krisdahaka: yes
[5:04:25] matt_caste: On some specs
[5:04:25] sourbutts: depends what class
[5:04:26] Synckery: on some classes
[5:04:26] kotchy91: Botton bloat is real
[5:04:26] ferahgok: On some specs
[5:04:26] buffnac: only on sv hunter :)
[5:04:27] nameyourform: some classes yes
[5:04:27] PunishedLrnz: no
[5:04:27] leeka: nope
[5:04:27] jukeandnuke: no
[5:04:28] satirically1: some specs yes too many bindings
[5:04:29] zerotensai: yes
[5:04:29] Synckery: not all
[5:04:29] AlphasaurusRexx: some specs. others no
[5:04:30] EmpStyle: Some specs
[5:04:31] ThatOneWeirdGuyInChatKekw: no
[5:04:31] hobk1204: Not on dh lul
[5:04:31] riplockx: no
[5:04:31] mudcx: arms has the most i swear
[5:04:31] kotchy91: Yes
[5:04:32] nameyourform: WW has 1mill
[5:04:32] Badasti: on my mage i have to put bomb / glacial on awkward keys
[5:04:33] mindrazor: ON some specs for sure
[5:04:33] peacant: but as a new player it would be yeah
[5:04:33] caulibrower: No
[5:04:34] CabinetMistake: yes
[5:04:34] Zlaitorn: Yes..
[5:04:34] squarepusher_: not really no
[5:04:35] DoYouWannaHug: There's a lot I like it but it's hard for newer players
[5:04:35] ATHLTE: i like having a bunch
[5:04:36] leckr: for pvp, yes
[5:04:36] pr1me1989: on shaman yes
[5:04:36] bjjamm: depends alot on the class I play
[5:04:37] nameyourform: WW
[5:04:38] ATHLTE: as an rdru main
[5:04:39] sourbutts: rsham maaaybe, otherwise no
[5:04:40] peacant: i feel like mage has a lot
[5:04:42] ItsBees: DH opinions don't matter Kappa
[5:04:43] ogdmt: resto sham so many buttons
[5:04:43] argalanmg: evoker has empty spots but it’s new so maybe that’s the bar
[5:04:43] jontepman: on Frost mage yeah
[5:04:45] ATHLTE: but on survival hunter for example its too much
[5:04:46] Vigi9413: I use a scimitar my life is easy
[5:04:46] jontepman: they have the most
[5:04:47] SlyMooseMan: If I didn't have to have focus macros it would be perfect.
[5:04:47] riplockx: aug is just 1
[5:04:48] krisdahaka: everyspec have 100 mini stuns/fears/roots
[5:04:49] raeza444: depends lol some specs have a lot goin on but i think its a product of talents and tier sets making too much happen
[5:04:51] DoYouWannaHug: I think needing arena 123 focus etc can force too many.
[5:04:51] Synckery: as PvPers we generally have like 10 more keybinds than the PvE players anyway
[5:04:54] Axtin: dh OMEGALUL
[5:04:55] peacant: mage has like 12 abilities that do damage
[5:04:56] Kujo_XX: Guy who collects millions reacting to memes and sipping soda all day finds vidya games too hard.
[5:04:58] hobk1204: Every dh button does 3x any hunter button so yeah
[5:05:00] pr1me1989: make it like diablo 1, 2, 3, 4
[5:05:01] Luigicamp: pve wise, yes, but then again, in pve some classes don't need to use half their spells
[5:05:02] sourbutts: spriest has the same problem but thats skill issue probably
[5:05:03] pr1me1989: :D
[5:05:07] HoGoFroGo: I feel like. people are going to be upset either way lol
[5:05:15] anon9753: yeah i get confused and sometimes press blade dance instead of fel rush and my dps drops from 120k to 100k for 4 seconds
[5:05:17] glindes: But you only spam lance and flurry
[5:05:19] Vigi9413: if you use arena 1 2 3 it’s definitely hectic
[5:05:19] zionzorshin: hey ven hows the weather in calgary
[5:05:21] HoGoFroGo: no ones ever happy
[5:05:28] Synckery: ngl more than 5-6 dmg abilities is too many
[5:05:28] sanctusirl: I feel like DH actually has a good level of spells
[5:05:33] buffnac: sv hunter is insanely fun but ppl do complain its got too much
[5:05:35] Badasti: for my shaman i have to use macros to cast a heal on a friendly target and a dmg spell and enemy targets - otherwise there's no way, too many buttons
[5:05:54] hobk1204: And yet he's probably not playing it anymore
[5:06:21] vodkacran: @anon9753 then it's fun when you do the opposite- "oops I accidently killed the mage"
[5:06:36] Synckery: passives can also be bad when they add in more modifiers and buffs/debuffs

[5:06:37] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy fabbernass WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[5:06:45] waelrick: yeah, i think some ppl were concerned about tracking more modifiers
[5:06:50] joyrex_j9: complexity is only fun if you're into the game, if you hate the game its a problem
[5:07:08] Ultramagnus85: These are going to be permanent tho
[5:07:10] Luigicamp: ff14 is also not loaded with websites that tracks how good or bad you are. Learn the fights, learn a few rotations, enjoy!
[5:07:13] raeza444: game aint even in beta man idk why we're getting to many think pieces already
[5:07:13] pr1me1989: i am so fed up of that ass mongold
[5:07:29] phanabananana: Everyone hates on Wow which is normal hate for dynasty's and that what wow is. Just like the Patriots and now the Chiefs
[5:07:38] Badasti: i hate borrowed power systems, if we have some other shit i need to level up through chores and shit ill probably stop after s1
[5:07:47] peacant: i disagree with that, new expansions should change playstyles. THere should probably be more ability replacements with changing hero talents rather than just adding more abilities
[5:08:05] Ultramagnus85: people def track how good or bad you are at the game in ffxiv its not any different
[5:08:17] Xawo87: People whine about the game the whole time that its now "cool" to whine about it. Its so much more fun than all the trashy side games theyve made in classic versions
[5:08:30] Ultramagnus85: @Badasti its not borrowed its gonna be "evergreen"
[5:08:38] azrothlol: yes plz
[5:08:48] addyz0r: I dont want more buttons. I want more fun buttons
[5:09:15] Axtin: cant wait to have a new ability that does aoe
[5:09:18] 7osei: sounds like a nightmare for the devs LuL
[5:09:26] nameyourform: more talents = More WAs @venruki
[5:09:29] ItsBees: I'd rather have less buttons that are more impactful Sadge casting wrath and starfire all the time is boring as butts
[5:09:34] SirBeaverTeeth: what did I miss, new updates?
[5:09:34] nameyourform: gonna hve 100 WAs for 1 class by the time this game ends
[5:09:34] EmpStyle: they're going further down the rabbit hole, not much we can do either, which is sad
[5:09:37] gelens1: then we get like 3 hero classes
[5:09:39] gelens1: KEKW
[5:09:57] murksi: STONKS
[5:10:01] gelens1: hero talents i mean
[5:10:12] Badasti: filthy dragonslayer
[5:10:15] buffnac: if they did that theyd needd a serious update on CD animations
[5:10:20] waelrick: hes doing a no addon healer challenge right now
[5:10:20] Crowdn: remove WA

[5:10:37] sourbutts: if they take addons away can blizzard implement a diminishing returns tracker since theres no way to track them without addons
[5:11:02] Crocfacex: 2.4 push on dh?
[5:11:03] Telarius1: why u entering arena in that fit this isnt trial of style
[5:11:04] fabbernass: so far druid and mage hero talents don't add any new buttons tho right? not sure how much complex the rotations will be tho with changes
[5:11:10] fabbernass: i haven't seen the rest
[5:11:19] buffnac: if cds were obvious addons wouldnt be as necessary
[5:11:28] sourbutts: tunnel the caster all game
[5:11:34] argalanmg: stupid when your biggest button does 4% of someone’s hp
[5:11:35] ScoggleWoW: look like a hobbit walking paris runway
[5:11:51] sourbutts: 3 melee 1 caster, tunnel the caster 6 games out of 6, from my experience

[5:13:24] Synckery: LUL
[5:13:26] absterge: HAHAHA
[5:13:29] ScoggleWoW: ofc
[5:13:32] thisisthotcaller: grats on the 2CR change!
[5:13:32] pr1me1989: hahahaha I feel u
[5:13:39] 7osei: I should go make some tea now that you mention it KEKW
[5:13:42] waelrick: LUL
[5:13:48] Magottx: when i first came in i thought you had on 3 chains too lol cause the wires were crossed
[5:13:51] driftclock: DH is totally balanced now?
[5:13:52] ScoggleWoW: You would win an xmog contest in the Shire for sure
[5:13:56] Synckery: twochainz
[5:14:10] Philand0: @driftclock yup, come back to retail we miss you
[5:14:54] AlphasaurusRexx: turd take imo
[5:15:06] sourbutts: classic wow is worse, same game with players having 15 years to min max lol
[5:15:14] hobk1204: That was the exact same in classic, min maxing hasn't changed
[5:15:19] storm_chaser_ron: classic wow min/maxing doesnt matter as much
[5:15:30] Synckery: in classic minmaxing is the only thing to do
[5:15:31] AlphasaurusRexx: every game has min max potential
[5:15:34] orcrimmar: everyone min/maxes on every game
[5:15:39] nimbus420i: MUH WORLD BUFFS BRO
[5:15:41] Synckery: all the classic players do parses and shit
[5:15:43] nimbus420i: SO I CAN AUTO ATTACK AHRDER
[5:15:47] buffnac: the min maxxing i would say is just easier on retail its more obvious on classic
[5:15:50] ScoggleWoW: its easier to be sweatier when your characters mechanics are much easier
[5:15:56] cruelhabbitts: need those auto attacks to slap
[5:16:08] ScoggleWoW: theres a huge gap in knowledge in retail WoW that doesnt exist in clssic
[5:16:10] driftclock: Classic wow is solved game, just super grind centric.
[5:16:17] FelQueen: It's boring if everyone plays the same overpowered spec, we need more variety in abilities and talents, maybe even an additional alternate PvP(PvE)-tree for the same spec but with different talents and approach
[5:16:18] Gore90: Honestly I hope they just completely kill addons off
[5:16:19] pr1me1989: titties?
[5:16:31] AlphasaurusRexx: @Gore90 will never happen
[5:16:38] driftclock: If they kill addons then they have to actually design a UI.
[5:17:03] ScoggleWoW: legit just think of all the continents and knowing where certain niche things are that you take for granted, 20 years of learning
[5:17:07] 7osei: that's true for many pvp games or competetive games though in my experience
[5:17:29] Telarius1: ya u wouldnt know still if u played before inner got buffed as well is thing
[5:17:33] Telarius1: cuz was never used until new
[5:17:34] Telarius1: now
[5:17:44] ScoggleWoW: I just cant believe how lost id be if I started playing this game today
[5:18:03] ScoggleWoW: it feels cool that its so big, but overwhelming most likely without help
[5:18:04] Xeliumimar: why is this guy wearing a blanket like that, i cant trust someone who does that
[5:18:13] pr1me1989: this is way too early to say that. we dont know how the game will be
[5:18:22] driftclock: @ScoggleWoW It's awful. There's no way to progressively learn.
[5:18:43] waelrick: yep
[5:19:10] ScoggleWoW: The UI update was nice but anything trackable has an addon to make it more customizeably noticeable
[5:19:19] thisisthotcaller: sounds just like DH :(
[5:19:36] Xeliumimar: what, you guys dont look at the really small icons in the top right corner of your screen lol
[5:19:42] Badasti: no ffs no borrowed power
[5:19:44] Badasti: i hate that
[5:19:47] buffnac: if the addons never got made i feel like the UI would have been fixed a long time ago but why do the extra work if youre blizzard
[5:19:47] ScoggleWoW: @driftclock I started in wotlk, if I didnt have an older bro who played before me, I wouldve been bad at the game for longer than just a few years lol
[5:19:48] Xawo87: the game should have inbuilt addons like that tbh, its just more enjoyable knowing u are getting super buffed. Im so bored when i watch crusaders screen, if he was mute whilst playing i wouldnt even be there
[5:19:56] mindrazor: It's all that brown rice!
[5:20:08] FelQueen: The difficulty is amazing, I generally hate easy games TakeNRG  How can we compete then if everyone is an arcade kid? PixelBob
[5:20:09] waelrick: LUL
[5:20:48] jukeandnuke: I want frostfire bolt back :)

[5:21:17] driftclock: @ScoggleWoW I quit during WotLK and came back for DF. I appreciate the depth but it's impossible to get my friends to play.
[5:21:19] lumaday: Thanks Jak!
[5:21:21] venruki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AD6n9cGOGY
[5:21:22] AlphasaurusRexx: @jukeandnuke you get it back with frostfire
[5:21:45] waelrick: the first talent is a new modifier LUL
[5:21:53] squarepusher_: Imagine how much more fried wow would be if we kept every borrowed power system.
[5:22:04] uhdaptiv: frostfire bolt (replaces frostbolt) is blizzard high?
[5:22:07] jukeandnuke: well eff me they added it back lol
[5:22:15] AlphasaurusRexx: all hero talents are 90% passive
[5:22:18] AlphasaurusRexx: so far
[5:22:20] Slayer_Eagleone: EZ Clap
[5:22:24] jontepman: well all the circular talents are passives lmao
[5:22:32] jukeandnuke: @AlphasaurusRexx thanks,
[5:22:36] Synckery: same for the paladin one
[5:22:42] Synckery: no extra buttons
[5:22:57] thisisthotcaller: i think DK is like that too?
[5:22:58] uhdaptiv: frostfire replaces frostbolt is ridiculous
[5:23:02] jontepman: Love the frostfire thingy
[5:23:07] addyz0r: that's good if they stay with that
[5:23:08] Magottx: i thnk thats cool right
[5:23:13] Falcanus: cant wait for my entire shaman hero tree to be countered by killing totems
[5:23:18] ViDDVuun: Read how bad the passives are though
[5:23:23] Axtin: depends on how complex the passives are tho
[5:23:27] driftclock: @Falcanus Farseer is immortal totems.
[5:23:34] satirically1: didnt they say on stage they wanted the power creep to expand on these over the next 3 xpacs instead of over one xpac?
[5:23:40] uhdaptiv: why the hell is frostfire replacing frostbolt tho?
[5:23:43] Ribastur0075: passives are boring, new abilities are more fun
[5:23:45] fabbernass: meteor/comet storm will be mandatory now so that may add a button if it's not played otherwise
[5:23:59] ScoggleWoW: The priest oracle talents seem interesting, like all PI buffs
[5:24:09] ScoggleWoW: could make it superrr aidss in pvp
[5:24:14] Xeliumimar: how would you rate dragonflight now since the expansion is almost over
[5:24:26] Falcanus: @driftclock no chance
[5:24:29] argalanmg: priest and paladin ones look awful to plat
[5:24:30] wyldeshock: what are the 3 blur keybinds for?
[5:24:44] ButtaTWD: how longs the last season going to be if the games not in alpha yet🥲
[5:24:47] addyz0r: i want something like: frost bolt changes to frost fire bolt. Passive: crits proc instant frostfire bolt. ect
[5:24:51] sourbutts: you mean that spell from WoTLK?
[5:25:07] buffnac: cosmetic rewards for spells would be insanely cool for them to explore with rewards
[5:25:08] addyz0r: yeah that's why i like it
[5:25:08] AlphasaurusRexx: @ButtaTWD same length as this season roughly. itll be similar to S4 of shadowlands if you were there for that
[5:25:13] Gotheels: DF S tier just from solo shuffle addition
[5:25:13] Magottx: Id rate DF a B+. shoulda been A but every season had one thing incredibly OP

[5:41:40] wackpoetic: the best part about playing DH is that regardless of talent build you still out DPS every other spec by 20%
[5:41:47] Telarius1: Make sure to spam immo aura when you get free CD resets on it too. It'll be your top damage (or close) rarely ive gotten up to 7 of them up at sametime

[5:47:46] Peacetreaty4: i think the immo build is the previous std build, but likely still bIS for certain matchups
[5:48:05] gdodmebxu: @Peacetreaty4 it's really good vs destro
[5:48:07] gdodmebxu: with the dispel
[5:48:19] Peacetreaty4: oh ya good call, playing the honor talent to dispel makes a lot of sense

[5:50:46] Telarius1: dont need it really
[5:50:49] casual_andyy: i guess so
[5:50:50] Telarius1: Since isolated gives u 100%
[5:50:55] gelatokush: @ooPickleRicKoo the only reaon that macro exist is because rogues have to many ability off gcd
[5:51:11] gdodmebxu: @gelatokush not really, it shouldn't work even with that being true
[5:52:09] Telarius1: @gdodmebxu  it can only work with alot of off GCD abiltiies.
[5:52:11] gelatokush: it would itterally not work if step and kick were o ngcd
[5:52:13] Telarius1: so yes, it is true. lol
[5:52:24] gdodmebxu: @Telarius1 i mean it shouldn't work even with them all of gcd because step resets camera
[5:52:29] gdodmebxu: lliterally doesn't matter
[5:52:38] Telarius1: It would work still.
[5:52:54] Telarius1: Cuz grapple also will change ur camera angle
[5:53:02] bruce_t_wayne: if u can't beat em join em i guess rukiGrin
[5:53:02] br187x: 4 wins 36 is so low

[5:53:40] Telarius1: grapple is on gcd i believe, its just step-kick off gcd is issue
[5:53:43] uhdaptiv: playing destro when dh exists..
[5:53:44] gelens1: play survival hunter
[5:53:46] Kymagez: @Telarius1 can you give me a tldr /w of the build/how its meant to be played

[5:55:49] Telarius1: i dont think u quit mage when its weak as example
[5:55:59] gelatokush: i mean regaurdless of their opness dh is still one of the fun class forsure
[5:56:00] gelens1: i only play dh since legion
[5:56:05] MalafisTV: @gdodmebxu the macro works because it sets the position for the hoof BEFORE the shadowstep. So, if it was on a gcd it wouldn't work anymore. The actions all happen so fast your character's position sets the hook point before you shadowstep kick and are already hooking back when those are done. As far as I understand it anyway. Haven't tried the macro myself.
[5:56:13] MalafisTV: Hook*
[5:56:13] Saitistreamy: the biggest problem right now is there isnt a clear DH counter
[5:56:24] Saitistreamy: bring back rock paper sciccors
[5:56:24] sanctusirl: Rogue?
[5:56:24] Magottx: No. i dont know. cause i have self respect. ... Ven rukiTrig
[5:56:33] markeexy: @Saitistreamy another dh
[5:56:36] MalafisTV: So the camera change doesn't matter st that point
[5:56:41] Telarius1: @Saitistreamy thats not unique to dh problem tho. just class design
[5:56:43] Telarius1: most are like this
[5:56:43] gelatokush: if they fix blur bug dh goign back down a tier
[5:56:44] MalafisTV: At*
[5:56:47] thisisthotcaller: whats aff lock like right now? Am i setting up myself for sadness if I try it out?
[5:56:49] Telarius1: dh is just currently 1 of most op
[5:56:52] sanctusirl: @Saitistreamy Sub shits on dh
[5:56:57] cruelhabbitts: is it ever worth it to use drain life on destro ? @venruki
[5:57:07] Magottx: @thisisthotcaller good luck brother man. hope you have no hair to pull out
[5:57:21] Reiumi_: PopNemo PopCorn
[5:57:24] Telarius1: the best counter to dh rn, is you try to remove them from game. CC them on their eyebeams, ect
[5:57:36] Telarius1: but most players wont try this
[5:57:37] uhdaptiv: there are more dhs above 2.4 in 3s rn than the bottom 11 dps specs combined KEKW
[5:57:45] Kymagez: @Magottx lies ive seen your hair
[5:57:58] Telarius1: theyre too op, so just mega cancer them, remove the op
[5:58:03] swolecolemole: @Telarius1 or we could just nerf them instead of saying we have to perma CC them
[5:58:08] Magottx: @Kymagez HAHA good thing therye in there deep
[5:58:24] thisisthotcaller: @Magottx righto... so i might have a better time not going aff I take it?
[5:58:29] Kymagez: LUL
[5:58:31] Telarius1: @swolecolemole not perma. like vs other dhs. they will make big effort to incap-eye beams, stun them, ect and they get huge damage dif from it
[5:58:48] Magottx: @thisisthotcaller you have to experience it. so when you reroll you appreciate more
[5:58:53] Telarius1: dh clearly needs nerf, but thats how u shuld play in shuffle vs dh
[5:58:55] gelatokush: easier class cant get the priviledge of also being good in pvp in this meta gaming scene
[5:59:35] gelatokush: u can let arcane mage and sub be op cuz 3/4 of the population still wont play it
[5:59:52] Telarius1: some people just dont like sub playstyle tho
[5:59:56] gelatokush: but if ret dh or war become op its an epidimy
[5:59:59] Telarius1: its boring to look for restealths
[6:00:26] Telarius1: also, arcne is nowhere near as hard as u think gelato
[6:00:36] gelatokush: def harder then war an dh tho
[6:00:45] Saitistreamy: its gonna suck in S4 when Lock is meh cause tier is gone
[6:00:47] Telarius1: i actually dont think so
[6:00:47] cruelhabbitts: those flame portals do big dam
[6:01:05] Telarius1: closer than u think
[6:01:10] sourbutts: nice games
[6:01:11] gelatokush: u can have arcane mage be the most op spec, the population wont be majority neevr on tha tspec
[6:01:41] figurines: now test destro burst. just like DH
[6:01:42] eygton: why only play one game?
[6:01:51] eainzsp: i wish more specs were like destro in terms of complexity
[6:01:59] gdodmebxu: i'm bad?
[6:02:01] DrunkJoe14: Solo Q times looking like an eternity rukiW
[6:02:03] Telarius1: @figurines why tho, palumor did a burst test already.
[6:02:03] famous1939: you crushed his feelings
[6:02:08] Telarius1: Destro was like #1 or #2
[6:02:43] figurines: @Telarius1 sssh nobody wants to hear from you after the DH burst comments
[6:02:53] Telarius1: @eainzsp destro isnt complex. its prob the easiest of the 3 specs
[6:02:55] What_ln_Tarnation: any anime enjoyers
[6:03:00] gdodmebxu: @Telarius1 nick's destro burst would never happen in arena
[6:03:06] likeewlock: no can do that stuff in palumor video in arena with destro
[6:03:14] gdodmebxu: same with jah's arcane burst
[6:03:18] likeewlock: no one
[6:03:18] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[6:03:25] Telarius1: well ya obvs for jah, he got like 3 hrs of attempts
[6:03:35] gelatokush: that destro burst was nasty in the video thp with shadow rift
[6:03:38] gelatokush: pretty cool
[6:03:44] gdodmebxu: yeah it was cool
[6:03:49] gdodmebxu: for sure
[6:03:49] Telarius1: mvq got like, 10 min of attempt lmao
[6:04:07] gdodmebxu: palumor asked them over and over if they wanted to try again
[6:04:13] Telarius1: not true
[6:04:19] Telarius1: well for jah yes
[6:04:22] gdodmebxu: lol i watched him record it
[6:04:25] gdodmebxu: what are you saying
[6:04:26] Telarius1: But for most people on that, i watched it live as well
[6:04:34] Telarius1: His rules were 3 attempts to not waste so much time
[6:04:59] Telarius1: but specific people (usually bigger names) got alot more time
[6:05:06] Axtin: the rule was until the player is happy with the burst
[6:05:09] gdodmebxu: ^
[6:05:12] What_ln_Tarnation: guys should i get a p365XL or glock 26?
[6:05:37] Telarius1: he didnt say that until like, after 5 specs already did it
[6:05:49] gelatokush: i got the tusk from garosh yesturday, working on a mog for my war i cant get Gorehowl to drop NotLikeThis
[6:06:02] Telarius1: its why example: mvq questioned why he only got 3 attempts and if he had gotten more, woulda done higher
[6:06:09] Telarius1: prob true for most of the specs
[6:06:19] Axtin: I was the first one he recorded and he let me do as many as I want
[6:06:27] Telarius1: ya
[6:06:35] Telarius1: And then once he got a few in, realized he cant just let people spam for hrs
[6:06:42] Telarius1: and changed rules further he got
[6:06:50] gdodmebxu: it's pretty clear you didn't watch palumor do it
[6:06:54] Telarius1: U can watch the vod, ull hear him say itll take forever
[6:06:56] uhdaptiv: who cares, its a pointless test lmao
[6:07:09] Telarius1: ya
[6:07:14] Telarius1: point is, it was inconsistant
[6:07:24] gdodmebxu: inconsistent
[6:07:33] Telarius1: first like 5 people got alot of attempt, then he realized it was takin forever
[6:07:39] Axtin: any burst video is very unrealistic
[6:07:39] Telarius1: idk how people arguein over this. its facts
[6:07:57] Telarius1: makes sense too, ull end up taking 1 billion attempts if u let everyone infinitely spam it
[6:08:50] gdodmebxu: "he didnt say that until like, after 5 specs already did it" " first like 5 people got alot of attempt, then he realized it was takin forever"
[6:09:08] Telarius1: i misstyped that, but u get the idea
[6:09:14] Telarius1: and its paraphrasing
[6:09:27] gdodmebxu: those are mutually inconsistent Kappa
[6:09:44] R1_Prototype: It’s not super important. It was a cool video idea and I really liked watching it.
[6:09:56] Telarius1: ya, i ment to say he allowed people at start more attempts and less later, cuz of time
[6:10:06] maralok31: raos  is good but way too expensive
[6:10:10] R1_Prototype: 90% off
[6:10:11] Telarius1: how cant u figure it out xD
[6:10:21] Magottx: 1 seems so cheap tho too lol

[6:10:41] maralok31: i just season it to make it better
[6:10:54] gdodmebxu: @Telarius1 maybe because you changed what you were saying 3 times
[6:10:57] gdodmebxu: no point to argue though
[6:11:04] Telarius1: i didnt change. i misstyped. and corrected it
[6:11:15] R1_Prototype: there is something about REAL Alfredo sauce you just made.
[6:11:20] Telarius1: ur just nitpicking or cant figure out clearly a mistake of order
[6:11:26] Magottx: i put some olive oil on my chicken rice and brocolli today. really spicin it up today
[6:11:35] Telarius1: just go watch vod. @gdodmebxu
[6:11:46] Telarius1: problem solved.
[6:11:54] gdodmebxu: nah not arguing

[6:12:12] R1_Prototype: that really cool one shot video
[6:12:17] banaa__x: do you have frost mage guid?
[6:12:18] Telarius1: essentially i just said if you watch palumor's burst vid live which i was there for
[6:12:18] sourbutts: that mage takes less skill that demon hunter everyone knows, thats why ven is lower on his dh than mage
[6:12:30] Telarius1: At start, he offered more attempts and less later as it was taking forever
[6:12:36] squarepusher_: The Kwok!
[6:12:37] Sheepyou: RECKFUL

[6:26:58] Somanie: looks pretty flat to me NODDERS
[6:27:29] cadillacseville: i think its more a lesson to not trust everything you see just because somebody important said it. and really it doesnt matter either way.
[6:27:32] heymomimonttv: i have a friend who believes the earth is flat, but he also believes hilary clinton eats babies and other nonsense. he's got no feet in reality at the moment lmao

[6:37:14] Peacetreaty4: using cloak on portal is a definite win for you tho
[6:37:15] Frig0z: can do what? cloak?
[6:37:30] sanctusirl: @What_ln_Tarnation if that were true then sub would be king.
[6:37:50] babyman1st: As a rogue main with the meta how it is lol we need it ... try playing without it ... lmao
[6:37:52] R1_Prototype: cloak and vanish used to be the oh shit button. now. it’s part of the rotation XD

[6:46:57] Flopsyde: me neither
[6:47:07] Cephqt: @Vigi9413 are they psychopaths
[6:47:14] HughJekok: I believe it
[6:47:14] Fixit_cat: Mom's spaghetti
[6:47:18] SteLawBro: I know, i cant believe it either. Cant imagine it. Always talking to myself.
[6:47:23] nameyourform: that makes no sense
[6:47:25] HughJekok: It all finally makes sense now
[6:47:27] Cephqt: how?
[6:47:27] cadillacseville: i cant help but think of the first guy to invent shower curtains and the curtains started waving
[6:47:29] zachgamegodx: ven are you doing  double stream today
[6:47:33] CKBandit: i think people are just misinterpreting the phenomenon
[6:47:33] zachgamegodx: or just 1 long
[6:47:35] Todzuerst: if you are a psychopath maybe
[6:47:46] Sheepyou: show on stream
[6:47:54] Cephqt: holy shit... 30-50% dont have internal monologue
[6:47:56] reavethederp: i bet its cuz of pie
[6:47:56] Cephqt: according to google
[6:48:05] Vigi9413: too much silence with no monologue
[6:48:08] SteLawBro: maP
[6:48:12] Slayer_Eagleone: monkaHmm
[6:48:18] vanlonja: @venruki How would people born deaf have an internal monologue?
[6:48:24] Fixit_cat: Fel Obelisk
[6:48:27] cadillacseville: how do they read without an internal monologue? thats how you know its bullshit. do you narrate every street sign you see?
[6:48:35] Cephqt: oh ive seen this video, so cool
[6:48:44] Slayer_Eagleone: NOTED
[6:48:50] callmetedddd: here we go
[6:48:56] Slayer_Eagleone: BOOOOM!

[6:49:23] Sweetmat_34: cell phone
[6:49:24] gdodmebxu: @reavethederp geometry
[6:49:26] Slayer_Eagleone: chat link the video
[6:49:42] cadillacseville: propaganda
[6:49:54] Fixit_cat: Reminds me of movie days at school
[6:49:55] reavethederp: dam
[6:49:57] dorfnrd: whats a kilometer
[6:50:05] Kymagez: why you on about sticks extending my guy?
[6:50:12] Slayer_Eagleone: dude this video just owned all the flat earthers :O
[6:50:20] Slayer_Eagleone: just one video
[6:50:22] Fixit_cat: Professor Ven, is this gonna be on the test?
[6:50:24] venruki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hZl3arO7SY
[6:50:32] themanw1thaplan: me too
[6:50:35] Kymagez: your stick extending?
[6:50:35] PsyqoSupreme: gotta have the zest
[6:50:36] Vigi9413: zest
[6:50:49] reavethederp: but how'd they know the shadow was difrent did he hire a guy to stand and one shadow?
[6:50:50] Slayer_Eagleone: venruki have you sent that video to any flat earther friends and what did they say?
[6:50:55] MalafisTV: Yes and everyone is required to watch the entire Cosmos series with Carl Sagan.
[6:51:01] Vigi9413: I bet that guy had an internal monologue
[6:51:01] Sheepyou: tomorrow im gonna show up with some sticks in my job
[6:51:02] ButtaTWD: need that dude to calculate when pvp changes inc
[6:51:04] Slayer_Eagleone: LUL
[6:51:12] Kymagez: tbh i didnt get it
[6:51:17] StromicusRex: you destroyed his whole mindset
[6:51:23] Badasti: prov thought to himself "this guy is crazy he will believe anything"
[6:51:24] Kymagez: but i dont think the earth is flat
[6:51:28] themanw1thaplan: don't flat earthers believe the sun is a lot closer, in which case different length shadows would somewhat make sense
[6:51:35] MalafisTV: Also the new one with Neil Degrasse Tyson is excellent. He was taken under Carl Sagan's wing when he was young
[6:51:38] Fixit_cat: I like the new one too
[6:51:59] junker_eq: PBS Space and Time channel on youtube is awesome too
[6:52:01] Cephqt: Physicist here.. the new ones are good content but much more inaccurate than the OG Sagan ones
[6:52:02] Seriousnesz: @themanw1thaplan they believe an enormous amount of entirely contradictory things
[6:52:05] Vigi9413: maybe I can get my wife to stop watching serial killer documentaries
[6:52:06] SteLawBro: I shall not lurn. Trump 2024
[6:52:15] Cephqt: I think good ol Neil likes to hear his own voice too much
[6:52:29] sanctusirl: Do you believe they will inflate at all this season? BibleThump It's been the hardest season to push 24 for me.
[6:52:31] R1klus: Hey @venruki do you use a naga or similar mouse? if so what do you have bound to it?
[6:52:34] Kymagez: yeah wtf is with wamen and serial killer crap
[6:52:39] Sheepyou: @Vigi9413 she is just figuring out how to kill you without any evidence LUL
[6:52:50] Vigi9413: so mine isn’t the only one who watches those?
[6:52:57] Vigi9413: spooky lol
[6:52:57] Somanie: we want to know what the new schemes are so we don't get murdered
[6:53:19] R1_Prototype: love cosmos. dislike NDT
[6:53:26] Sheepyou: i love Mr MONK
[6:53:29] Somanie: To Make a Murderer is an amaaaaazing documentary btw (not a serial killer, but good show)
[6:54:04] Somanie: HE DECLASSIFIED PLUTO AS A PLANET
[6:54:04] Cephqt: NDT just likes to hear his own voice honestly. that's the main turnoff for me
[6:54:15] themanw1thaplan: agree
[6:54:24] Cephqt: Hes too self centered, no devoted like Sagan
[6:54:31] Cephqt: not**
[6:54:34] Myth_The_Wolf: @venruki I was about to ask you to play Destro lock so I could learn
[6:54:42] Badasti: I also get that impression from NDT, I'm more of a Michio Kaku man myself
[6:54:49] Somanie: as soon as Pluto was off the planet list, I had beef with NDT
[6:55:03] Myth_The_Wolf: Hell yeah
[6:55:05] Sheepyou: whats best stat as destru ? my WL is full mastery
[6:55:08] Myth_The_Wolf: Could you say "boom" like 3 times a second
[6:55:10] JBugaboo: when you get free chaos bolt procs i wanna hear a moan
[6:55:11] Fixit_cat: Now with 100% more demon voice
[6:55:12] Cephqt: Educators like Carl Sagan are so rare bro... if we had more people like that more kids would go into STEM
[6:55:15] Kymagez: @Somanie ok ty!!!!
[6:55:22] HughJekok: might as well turn off game sounds Kappa
[6:55:24] Kymagez: Pluto best planet
[6:55:25] Somanie: @Kymagez eh?
[6:55:25] koonakeenay: hes basically that classic naruto rogue but for retail warlock
[6:55:28] Somanie: TRUE

[6:58:39] cadillacseville: this looks like an echo stream
[6:58:42] dmgcurry: looks like race to world first set up

[6:58:51] reavethederp: but the cow jumped ove the moon
[6:58:51] junker_eq: They're sending the first female to the moon so they can plant a Live Laugh Love flag
[6:58:56] Sheepyou: im pretty sure the 70s moon landing was fake
[6:58:58] skwiglz: 1972 was the last time ven
[6:59:03] Kymagez: its not a person you said?
[6:59:07] Chrono_s: @Slayer_Eagleone yes but only for samples, little things
[6:59:10] Salanzo: @Sheepyou i hope you're kidding tho
[6:59:17] JBugaboo: heard they're going back up there to plant an lgbtq flag
[6:59:18] Flip_Method: i like the one guy who just winked at the camera
[6:59:19] figurines: @dmgcurry probably same budget
[6:59:21] nameyourform: these are clips from neil armstrong in 1969 i believe. i think its a rerun

[6:59:34] Kymagez: we send stuff
[6:59:34] MalafisTV: Well other countries have sent robotic landers
[6:59:34] callmetedddd: they saw aliens there
[6:59:34] Slayer_Eagleone: venruki i know right? it sounds like a scamaz
[6:59:35] 777delayed: cus there is not need to race

[7:00:00] shivwren: @Myth_The_Wolf We're revoking your moon invitation

[7:00:59] heymomimonttv: they got comms off stream in case of stream snipers
[7:01:01] koonakeenay: i also think thats part of the spectacle of the conspiracy if we ever went to the moon in the first place. 50 + years later and no one has made a touch down since. we went ot the moon before the internet was created
[7:01:06] sanctusirl: It's like listening to Whaz's team.
[7:01:08] Fixit_cat: Should be a communications consultant for them
