[4:24:59] Espriest: Soda is the real FACE of twitch. He revolutionized Twitch and popularized many games on Twitch. Without Soda, Twitch would be nothing. Soda is the only true content creator to still provide the most unique and real experience. He shares everything with us, we can live vicariously through him. That is why I will never donate and sub as he provides the best free content out there.
