[2:19:50] StartupTim: Honest question, I would like to try using this as well, but it seems to be against the ToS.  Could somebody let me know please?
[2:20:03] WanderingFeral: @startuptim  no clues
[2:20:08] WanderingFeral: Clue*
[2:20:10] dan1ka: Swifty might answer it
[2:20:18] Jananas12: @StartupTim 2 PCs
[2:20:57] Kaldeem: ToS is using software to control characters. He's actually controlliing both pcs and characters.
[2:20:57] Skruxy: LOLW
[2:20:58] mr_deimor: 2 wow 2 pc 2 controlers 1 person
[2:20:59] StartupTim: @StartupTim I understand it is 2 PCs, but Blizzard specifically says that using hardware to assist with multiboxing (the foot pedal) is against the rules.  So I don't get it, isn't this against the rules?
[2:21:04] calivarr: F

[2:21:08] nightwings28: so yeah
[2:21:09] k1m1Live: @StartupTim I'm sure you are allowed to play the game with your feet if you want. Just use a second PC for the other account.
[2:21:20] madness657: kick him!
[2:21:27] Cheaptrix: Swifty you are so creative and innovative! Such a cool streamer! Been watching you since 2009 Bro!
[2:21:40] dan1ka: Yep, 2 seperate PC-s and accounts
[2:21:44] nightwings28: arcane bombs silence when casting and the little engi guys do it
[2:21:46] StartupTim: @StartupTim I don't think so since Blizzard's ToS specifically says using hardware to assist is against the rules.
[2:21:54] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Close To You - Original Mix by Draven -> https://prtzl.io/KbHQbAxyjowb5dsW
[2:22:00] Amaradox: Multiboxing is using one PC for multiple accounts all being controlled from that one PC's peripherals, macros, 3rd party software, etc - no?
[2:22:04] bayther729: rip
[2:22:46] Spain_ua: It's fullbody gaming
[2:22:49] Amaradox: right - I am saying I do not think Swifty is technically "multiboxing"
[2:22:51] madness657: awesome background
[2:23:03] Foxhound67: when did multi boxing become bannable?
[2:23:03] TheDmike: Thats not true, you could multibox with more than 1 pc, in the software said Isboxer or hkn you can bind 2 pc together
[2:23:04] WanderingFeral: @startuptim I thought it was only against TOS if you have it all running on one computer  and you’re using your hardware to control macros for both characters
[2:23:07] StartupTim: @Swifty The thing is Blizzard specifically disallows using hardware to multibox, and on their forums, they specifically said foot pedals are not "primary inputs" and thus are actionable.  So I don't understand how this is allowed.  It seems like it would not be.
[2:23:07] madness657: XD
[2:23:11] Simends: (fullbody gaming)(real)
[2:23:13] Amaradox: KEKW

[2:23:28] cheebert: you're just asking for weirdos with that foot cam
[2:23:33] StartupTim: @WanderingFeral Multiboxing is 1 human controlling multiple games.   Blizzard specifically even said using hardware pedals is against the rules.
[2:23:36] fogh79: Are you using the petals because you feel it is easier or because alt tabbing is bad for streaming quality?
[2:23:36] Ryun0911: you would be better off having the pally standing back and not worry about him attacking, but hehe if you wanna suffer
[2:23:44] Pawdeloup: @StartupTim @StartupTim hardware to multiply commands, he juste plays the game 2 times at the same time, he doesn't reproduce 10x the commands
[2:23:53] sharmzy_: @cheebert dont kink shame

[2:24:30] Enigmio: they specifically said, third party programs not allowed
[2:24:30] CosmoJaeger: LUL imagine having rules that would rule out people with some disabilities, playing games in 2022 ? WutFace

[2:26:07] dan1ka: No its not lol
[2:26:17] Dysast3r_: can share both revenge macros again please ?
[2:26:22] StartupTim: @Swifty  I literally quoted the ToS, word for word.  It says "that use of all hardware mechanisms... to streamline multiboxing in any way may result in account penalties."

[2:27:11] R0dimes: why would there be a rule against using pedals what if you had a disability
[2:27:22] fogh79: Multiboxing simply means playing more than one character at a time. I play 5 on the same comp. It's only against toa if you use software to control the others
[2:27:23] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!

[2:27:44] StartupTim: @fogh79 software and hardware.  The ToS literally was updated months ago to include hardware.
[2:27:47] Kadmon7: this is not multiboxing he is not automating his actions and pedals are used by people with disabilities
[2:27:49] Pawdeloup: swiftyPcool

[2:42:40] fogh79: I don't see the need for pedals either. Alt tab is fine and requires a lot more skill but I can see why streams wouldn't use alt tab. Wouldn't be good content I think - switching between accounts.

[4:02:59] havoc21777: @galdrena Yeah I get it. Believe me. My thing about Retail vs Classic is Retail became way to easy to do things. Like questing and leveling. To much story line, cutscenes. It was like pointless in some ways. But with Classic it had that authentic feel that made me fall in love with the game to begin with
[4:03:02] shiny___charizard: harbor*

[4:49:10] sharmzy_: i remember tthose runescasters as Mage, spell steal and isntantly be top dps
[4:49:23] ZHEJ: @Skaun Jokerd mentioned it earlier. So pretty much what happens is if you solo and try to pull a bunch of mobs and kite for long time, eventually the mobs damage themselves (idk how but they get a debuff on them)

[7:24:57] GroovyBryan: Wotlk*
[7:25:54] Winter7735: Horde are scary though :(
[7:25:59] xs395: Yes they will. It's literally two mages being rude and making everyone frustrated
[7:26:13] Treesy__: All Dks and paladins should go straight south and not stop still final gy due to speed boost
[7:26:30] BakedTendy: Botanica good exp?
[7:26:43] xs395: these mods. can i have my sub back

[7:27:48] Dahgos: hey swifty just coming back  to wow... my buddy bought me a subscrip and it comes with a 70 boost... i played a SP in retail bfa/SL .. any suggestions if boosting a Priest is worth? or should i roll a different class

[7:29:10] mrbeannz: Do you have a guide for ur macros
[7:29:15] xs395: I'm not trying to insult, it's just interesting hearing a primarily horde perspective speaking about what and how alliance don't do this or never do that, and I pointed it out and got my message removed.

[7:32:49] Rastafaris: and racial wise both sides have a lot of crazy utility both horde and alliance
[7:33:13] XxKatsuraxX: @Swifty this is crazy lol but awesome at the same time
[7:33:44] Rastafaris: and i can say swifty got me into making zandalari paladin and the racial was so good i didnt even wanted to play anything else

[7:40:44] Tordrek_: you might be 80 by raid release in 10 days LUL
[7:41:11] quite_unpleasant: Not hard so solo as a UA warrior. You kill them before they kill you, and use bandages and the TK health potions that keep dropping often.

[8:00:05] Desbeanz: why leveling in Botanica?
[8:00:05] corruptReality: @lordrogu he is playing 2 characters
[8:00:21] prahnerd: when can we see more irl vids on youtube?
[8:00:30] cutscene__: So why botanica first ?
[8:01:11] StreamElements: @duckzgo, item not found, you can see all items here https://StreamElements.com/swifty/store  elementsS
