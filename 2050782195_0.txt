[1:09:12] andyjamesgames: wanted to be an architect after i read Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead"
[1:09:20] MindhackerTV: is perfect to end up working in Walmart
[1:09:22] Seoken1: architecture has the chance to impact generations 200-500+ years from now hypothetically, which is super cool
[1:09:24] Vinto12: hi staysafe :D
[1:09:26] Zezlo: Kraków has excellent architecture
[1:09:30] Mertauh: pretty much no grind in WoW is worse than osrs, so if you can do osrs you'll be fine

[1:12:20] Mertauh: @Diiblaze No but a sub gets you access to all of them on the same acc (similar to rs can't be logged into both at once)
[1:12:22] Diiblaze: @Mertauh my friends told me to pre order then new expansion like they did , is it worth? and which version is that , war within or something like that
[1:12:37] NaManDatAintMe: naktomi tower obvs
[1:12:44] MindhackerTV: or finishing the next walmasrt stand
[1:12:44] ChillyHTX: thats the same thing with Petro and Chem engineers
[1:13:04] triptik: i went to a tech highschool and did 4 years of CAD. was fun
[1:13:05] Mertauh: @Diiblaze War Within is retail which is the most modern version of WoW. Its like rs3 where its as the game has continued. That's the only one you have to pay for outside of a sub. You can also try the other versions if you get it

[1:13:46] DaddySmelly: yes
[1:13:56] ChillyHTX: @triptik YEP  u old
[1:13:56] Zezlo: is that like MS paint?
[1:14:09] NaManDatAintMe: haha
[1:14:12] Mr_Moffert: ms paint but worse
[1:14:29] Vinto12: I can draw a stick man in ms paint peepoHappy
[1:14:36] Mertauh: @Diiblaze Probably level up from the start then if you want to try a different class you can use your boost. Depends on what your friends wanna do. You can hit max level very quickly though. Endgame is all that matters in retail, its not about the journey where classic is more about the journey tieing into end game
[1:14:37] ChillyHTX: peepoRun can u put on some forest gump music
[1:14:40] ChillyHTX: for the journey
[1:14:41] graeme_tbm: CAD is still used often, Im a chartered civil engineer and its still used by our technicians to produce design drawings
[1:14:41] Diiblaze: @Mertauh and is it like osrs and rs3 where osrs has 10x the playerbase?
[1:14:50] triptik: best thing about CAD was using the sticker machine EZ

[1:16:01] triptik: Nerdge
[1:16:02] ChillyHTX: I could barely draw a bear
[1:16:11] Mertauh: @Diiblaze It's hard to say since blizzard doesn't release player numbers like jagex, but there are a few 3rd party sites that attempt to source numbers though less accurate. Classic is more popular but it might be more like 3 to 1 than 10 to 1. Retail was really bad for a few years but the last expansion was alright and people who play it are hopeful about the future
[1:16:23] NaManDatAintMe: is making people out of mash potatoes art?
[1:16:23] Rell203: @DaddySmelly man that's really hard to do when you have a pc-based job
[1:16:43] Diiblaze: @Mertauh Oh i see , thanks for helping me understand :)

[2:02:26] NutterCircus: Social Manipulation.
[2:02:30] Vapp3: @nekodaye ?????
[2:02:34] freehawk1: Yeah women used to be way happier when they only had to look after and bear children. Now they need a career and also have the responsibility for the household and have to raise the kids. And some focus so much on their career that it is hard for them to get children because they are too old
[2:02:40] kirurgen95: maybe because you have to grind 50 years to afford a house these days
[2:02:43] Pwinzor: historically women were stay at home and raise the kids now they are working KKona they took our jobs

[2:04:33] kmdoqjw: I have the problem of trying to turn the women im attracted to into the woman i want to be with long term
[2:04:47] smander: I have a job in Education (m) my fiancee has a C suite job in business and its a never end complain fest about how she doesnt want to be doing this but doesnt want a "normal" lifestyle on a teacher salary to stay home and raise kids... can't help sometimes but wonder if she's been tricked into an ideology where things and money are worth trading happiness and career enjoyment
[2:04:59] Vunoka: @specialmass Not in all areas, that comment I made was more in regards to having simple and healthy pleasures. Masculinity still has its cultural areas, femininity seems to be completely gone
[2:05:11] NutterCircus: Just become better for yourself.
[2:05:12] kmdoqjw: lol
[2:05:15] Zwixxy: How are you preparing for p2?
[2:05:16] Pr0phetic: incel is kind of a misnomer as well. the reason they don'¨t get any is because of their outlook. aka their own fault
[2:05:32] andyjamesgames: lead by example

[2:07:13] m00n4nds74r: i got it, we kill the batman, then the women will listen to us
[2:07:23] l_nyne_l: @Vapp3 just take 50 dollar and go to some escort lady
[2:07:32] NutterCircus: My brother puts way too much emphasis on getting laid.
[2:07:45] Vunoka: @Vicente_Prime the I will remain an incel

[2:48:08] WhaleBlast: are you on the streamer realm?
[2:48:11] coffebreak: @StaysafeTV are you just storing "boxes" or can you figure out which ones are "the higher level/tier" ones?
[2:48:15] ChillyHTX: its 5 o clock somewhere
[2:48:30] coffebreak: huh, how?

[2:50:51] wolfystyleftw: yeah but 7 ate 9
[2:50:54] gambleragain: @StaysafeTV They also said marks are excludable from Restore.
[2:50:57] Cenarios13: why would they purge at all then
[2:50:58] Wazirend: Are they purging all mail or only marks?
[2:51:01] AceOfFlame: Do you think there will be a long maintenance on the 8th? @StaysafeTV
[2:51:06] Zezlo: @StaysafeTV the best part of SoD P2 is no longer having to respond to "mailbox purge" comments KEKW

[2:52:46] un_heilig: LL
[2:52:48] un_heilig: LUL
[2:52:48] cicz: no way ?
[2:53:05] otpasix: you are not 7/10 , more like 9/10
[2:53:06] hoaxxes: Your not giving yourself enough credit 100% 9/10 autistic
[2:53:06] killthnrun: im so happyy they took out the GDKP
[2:53:10] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: there are some sweaty bois out there
[2:53:23] Wazirend: Mages prolly gonna solo SM
[2:53:25] shawshanks86: How are you going to farm boxes when you can only keep one at a time? Did they change how many you cam hold?
[2:53:26] OneTouchBust: bread inc
[2:53:36] joepera: what do you think will be the top dmg classes at lvl 40?
[2:53:37] x_aim_: the older I get the more difficult it is for me to fall asleep and stay asleep anyone else?
[2:53:39] desweck: a mage was able to get 25 in 7 hours, so def 40 is possible in 24
[2:53:52] JustOndore: Could you link that sheet?
[2:53:55] dispensaryttv: caster cleave gonna be cracked
[2:53:58] neomonstr: Let's be real, a level 40 mage can even solo ZF, so mages will have an absurdly OP goldfarm in phase2 monkaS
[2:54:05] dispensaryttv: 3 mages a lock and priest
[2:54:13] AceOfFlame: EZ
[2:54:14] OneTouchBust: WAIT

[2:55:07] kaladhras: what ever happened with the gum guy did he flee to guadalajara
[2:55:09] neomonstr: imagine phase3 leveling LUL Mages are just gonna sit in ZF for 6 hours from 40-50 LUL
[2:55:13] Peoplewhinetoomuch: How do you know thw boxes will give rep? Just wondering because the lower lvl boxes stop giving rep and so maybe these boxes arw low lvl in next phase.
[2:55:14] OneTouchBust: yeah but can you soulstone in hardcore yet?
[2:55:33] grizz430: skeleton keys are cheap on wild growth, the elixir of firepower ones are retarded

[2:56:04] redshift_0: stop the cap
[2:56:08] salsaboyirl: THE BOXES
[2:56:14] x_aim_: do you have that morning coffee? or energy drink?
[2:56:15] SirHeiska: I blame boxes!
[2:56:19] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Nono i mean if you turn in a box north of mulgore and youre not capped they dont give rep
[2:56:26] darthterac: tickle me elmo
[2:56:27] neomonstr: @Zezlo I said the same thing a few minutes ago :D in reality mages are the rulers of WoW, everyone else are just memers NotLikeThis
[2:56:45] iBanEvader: @Peoplewhinetoomuch those are low level boxes
[2:56:46] hoaxxes: he means the lower rep ones
[2:56:56] darthterac: why do you have alliance shoulders on?
[2:56:58] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @ibanevader I know.
[2:57:03] neomonstr: @Zezlo They got the best leveling, the best goldfarms, they're one of the best pvp-classes etc.
[2:57:23] Zezlo: @Zezlo luckily blizzard nerfed their healing spell again, making it include ALL aoe spells to reduce healing granted by 80%, so no more living flame healing etc
[2:57:32] WhaleBlast: Pog wsg
[2:57:38] desweck: soloq is awful atm, just premades
[2:57:39] salsaboyirl: gl champion
[2:57:40] Ghamera: affliction leveling runes are haunt, incinerate, master channeler?
[2:57:40] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @ibanevader but next phase these boxes might be low lvl is what im trying to find out.
[2:57:51] tharessz: Will weyland supply give that much exp?
[2:58:05] killthnrun: where best spto to farm them boxes my boii
[2:58:07] neomonstr: @Zezlo Truuue, but for ZF mages won't need Living Flame, although it'll still be used to speed things up LUL
[2:58:07] WhaleBlast: @desweck He's horde though
[2:58:10] brandvarmbums: did they not state that they would remove all non used marks by p2 launch?
[2:58:11] TheSanguist: I thought they were still determining that number?
[2:58:12] xavilar: Source?
[2:58:14] otpasix: 200 xp ? u sure?

[2:59:32] MatthewRMF: Does anyone actually know when the next phase comes out like timewise?
[2:59:32] iBanEvader: so it is worth it
[2:59:36] redshift_0: xp from two mobs after 25 cap raised = 200 xp. Farming a box and filling it in TB = 200 xp. Guess its not worth it for most people :)
[2:59:39] killthnrun: yoiu get that from completing 2 quest
[2:59:45] Qtxo1: ive farmed 21 and i've died a little inside doing it
[2:59:47] neomonstr: @otpasix Like 25-40 is gonna take a lot of time anyway LUL

[3:01:16] shiggydoo43: if they said BFD raids for XP will be "substantial even up to level 37", this surely means itll be at least one full level at 25 and even past that no?

[4:14:14] parkrangerpeter: Can we advocate for both GDKP to be banned AND blizz to continue to improve and ban more bots?
[4:14:17] desweck: it's 100% lack of will
[4:14:18] smander: instead of spending time farming .spend time farming bots
[4:14:18] Joxtirol: Btw are we sure they would give 200xp Blizzard said boxes 25-40 will give more xp and high lvl boxes is 25 lvl quest according questie. @StaysafeTV
[4:14:19] copper_cloud: They need to take notes from the government. they prosecute drug distibuters, buyers, and manufacturers. Blizz needs to do the same with gold
[4:14:29] mrgulla: @copper_cloud This kek
[4:14:30] rjhasnoclue: Bot accounts make up a ton of their monthly revenue
[4:14:32] clamthenerd: GDKP forever. give me your chinese gold, buyers
[4:14:38] perseay797: Banning GDKP will reduce the demand for gold buying significantly. Provided they will be thorough and consistant with it.
[4:15:04] ChillyHTX: I love the giver
[4:15:08] mrgulla: Going after buyers and not botters is just lazy

[4:16:16] Reiumi_: monkaW
[4:16:18] Mertauh: They can't catch all criminals so legalize crime
[4:16:25] boopbopbamski: blizz has all the stats and info they could insta ban all the bots but why would they do that
[4:16:26] ChillyHTX: New york tunnel GDKP's monkaCOPTER
[4:16:27] Whitemamba236: they'll form through discords

[4:16:30] cloudstrife543: 95%
[4:16:31] b0ndl: 99%
[4:16:31] plumpus81: 25-30% is my estimate
[4:16:35] zVaall: dont let perfect stop the path of good
[4:16:38] eshonxv: 99% of them, you wont even see gdkp advertising in lfg
[4:16:42] perseay797: 50%
[4:16:48] LoRswat: 30-60 will immediately stop....the rest will try to some degree
[4:16:49] dtl78: then creeps back up like botting and gold selling
[4:16:51] kransenbror: 5Head Move
[4:16:51] boopbopbamski: if blizzard cares about doing something in the game and cracking down they will do it LUL they dont ban bots because they wanna min max $$
[4:17:05] Dreadnought628: for a while you would see a sizable reduction... but after a while people would test it and if still no bans they would come back in full
[4:17:06] 3verythingatonce: those people that would stop at the threat are also not the people buying gold out of threat of banning
[4:17:12] fietsopa4: but not all of them
[4:17:15] daqful: 60%
[4:17:16] Shocklate_: YEP
[4:17:18] perseay797: LETS DO IT Pog
[4:17:22] plae007: as someone who does them across all 8 of my toons, 90% of the discords im in stopped doing them just because idiots already mass reporting them for typing "LFM GDKP" in LFG chat even if its not banned yet @StaysafeTV
[4:17:25] rjhasnoclue: Maybe 50% decrease, but over time when people were doing it and others were seeing no consequence, it would ramp back up
[4:17:29] aengelmonhster: All gdkps will cease over time hmmmmmmmmm
[4:17:30] boopbopbamski: you dont want to insta ban bots you want to give these ppl time to farm make profits and keep coming back when they do "ban waves"
[4:17:33] hydrobeam_: damn long stream poggers
[4:17:33] holdenwook: Blizzard will never take meaningful action against gold buyers because way too much of their player base buys gold, and it would be detrimental from a business standpoint
[4:17:35] perseay797: Don't you think Asmon just hates SoD? @StaysafeTV
[4:17:36] IIINUCLEAR: just got the last piece of gear I needed for bis on my mage seqPog
