[1:40:15] TheBuisnesss: why does alliance get 50% bg buff?
[1:40:31] Pallyofhell: im 411 ilvl in pvp
[1:40:36] Pallyofhell: and almost 370 ilvl in pve
[1:40:40] Shavarko1: cause alliance pvp was dead a few years back

[3:48:59] Gorillagrip: rogues already got super nerfed
[3:49:02] Fenril_TTV: No rogues are good but not sub
[3:49:05] BlitskriegWar: He said good in PvP not PvE
[3:49:05] baron_signas: So you're saying we should pray for BM hunter buffs?
[3:49:06] MilesLonng: yeqhhh righhhhhht
[3:49:08] Justissier: Rogues have always and wil lalways be greeat in PvP
[3:49:10] mrblond5: Swifty which  name plates are u using ?
[3:49:11] Vendrek: I hope both recieve a 15% nerf to damage or CDs
[3:49:16] Fenril_TTV: Almost content is aoe so outlaw is best in pve
[3:49:24] Fenril_TTV: I am enjoying sub for pvp it’s so fun
[3:49:36] mace2k2: @storen707 Thanks for the gift sub!  I appreciate it!
[3:49:39] MilesLonng: I want them nerfed so bad
[3:49:42] Fenril_TTV: But demon hunter dps spec is the same in pvp and pve so yeahhh

[3:50:00] Packerfan1993: dk needs a big buff
[3:50:01] MilesLonng: unplayable
[3:50:38] LitDemon: dat hunter nopin' out lol
[3:50:40] XxLonollixX: i hate what they did to the priest
[3:50:41] lolwtfreally: Yo Swifty :)
[3:50:46] baron_signas: That nerf to their heals made a noticeable difference.
[3:51:07] Packerfan1993: dks are almost unplayable due to having no heals
[3:51:10] Fenril_TTV: I mean I actually enjoy rogue more in pvp but only cause I KNOW it - like I am a really good pvp rogue - and like you said the skill cap for rogue is higher so it’s harder to play - so if I’m good on rogue then it actually means I’m a good player whereas demon hunter is easy no matter the skill level
[3:51:20] Airwaive: lol horde have turned pathetic

[3:53:52] Throkkz: NOTHING MEANS NOTHING
[3:54:00] Fourgiants: nice
[3:54:01] baron_signas: So more sustained damage than burst I'm assuming?
[3:54:17] Fenril_TTV: Sorta yeah
[3:54:32] Fenril_TTV: But outlaw has too much RNG with roll the bones - and in pvp that can make or break a fighr
[3:54:51] Fenril_TTV: Sub literally I can open on a clothie and hit 55k in 1 global :)
[3:55:00] Fenril_TTV: It FEELS more bursty
[3:55:01] baron_signas: I'll have to look into it because I was gonna do PvP on my hunter and either my spriest or rogue.
[3:55:09] Fenril_TTV: Outlaw just doesn’t feel bursty in ovo
[3:55:13] Fenril_TTV: Pvp*
[3:55:14] UrsineTV: outlaw rogeus are all about luck
[3:55:16] UrsineTV: tbh

[3:56:51] angelbutt3: yes
[3:56:52] Fenril_TTV: I think I’m so attached to rogues because I’ve played rogue since vanilla! And I literally know the class Inside and Out! Like @swifty with a warrior
[3:57:11] BlitskriegWar: @Fenril_TTV I play Assassin and I can recommend at least trying it for a bit. It can be satisfying watching all the bloods and poisons tick

[3:57:45] Dudutoolbox: my cough
[3:57:47] Fenril_TTV: Yeah I have seen other assa rogues but again it just isn’t my STYLE to watch dots tick em away - that’s like a warlock and I hate warlocks lol
[3:58:09] Fenril_TTV: I love dagger rogues that have big crits and burst in a 10 second period so that’s sub

[3:58:29] Fenril_TTV: Outlaw is BIS for pve - and it’s OK for pvp but only for team fights
[3:58:42] StreamElements: Headset is Corsair Virtuoso https://cor.sr/Swifty
[3:58:45] baron_signas: Yep
[3:58:49] Fenril_TTV: Sub is bis for solo but assa can be bis for pvp for team fights cause of dotting so many
[3:58:58] clouded4L: swifty no yellow banana set :(
[3:59:15] Dudutoolbox: that mic's quality is insane
[3:59:24] Fenril_TTV: Ok back to work! I’ll be back in a bit guys

[4:19:10] Dudutoolbox: didnt u used to be on darkspear?
[4:19:21] Fenril_TTV: i think they should slowly introduce content to slow it down a bit and make it feel more like vanilla ya know?
