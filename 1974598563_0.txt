[0:52:19] KoG_Xiepher: @Siplius Same! I've seen newer ones that are printed though. Kinda like a cotton with a print on it.
[0:52:19] GaryEnkelis: I'm just saying, is it right to use a person's likeness to, for example, create "adult entertainment" of them? Same for voices being manipulated.

[0:53:49] elimud: it's crazy how classic started as a you think you do but you don't, and now it's basically the 2nd most popular mmo lol
[0:53:49] thisformatsucks: Those types of websites also claim ESO has like 500k+ players which is not even remotely true

[0:54:46] metalwrath22222: mistahmistah there is world pvp if you get flagged or enable yourself
[0:54:47] CrowCawl: the only thing about ESO is it's popularity goes up and down wildly between expansioins
[0:54:49] hashpipe: @kokochris the only good mmo buddhaPray a fellow scholar
[0:54:52] BOXakaJOEMOVES: Hardcore also offers the one thing MMO's have not done up until this point, and that's include Permadeath
[0:54:55] mondtier22: microsoft is huuuge now in gaming
[0:54:56] BrutalxBarbie: ESO was good I just couldn‚Äôt get into it like WOW
[0:54:57] bgriff87: Even my friend who "hates MMOs" plays ESO LUL
[0:54:57] murrsu: @andaroo crossover event time danRoll
[0:55:08] kasded: @Azathul Not sure
[0:55:09] thisformatsucks: I love ESO but finding people for late game content is a pain

[0:55:24] andaroo: WOW, FF14, Black Desert, Eve, Guild Wars, ESO - all MMOs other than those are kinda not doing well, bu tthose 6 do pretty well
[0:55:26] Steppie: @DansGaming What do you main in ESO?
[0:55:26] valianya: They're soon going to have 5 different versions of WoW.  Classic, Classic Hardcore, Classic Season of Discovery, Classic Cataclysm, Retail
[0:55:28] Alexlistair: that's normal in new expansions/campaigns
[0:55:30] mondtier22: because the expansions sucked
[0:55:38] Johnkoffee: @chat what addon is the quest reading addon
[0:55:44] metalwrath22222: I reaaaaaly wish that they kept wotlk classic servers FeelsBadMan
[0:55:45] andaroo: ESO's combat is so... ugh tho
[0:55:46] AncientSteltek: Does non-classic WoW look the same as classic I watch now?
[0:55:46] hashpipe: @kokochris AC was great too, but EQ was the goat.. i think i was too young to actually understand AC
[0:55:47] mistahmistah: @metalwrath22222 oh yeah, keep forgetting some mobs flag you.
[0:55:48] Lovelocke: ESO just added the Endless Archive which is really fun
[0:55:50] bgriff87: ESO is worth it if you really like the Elder Scrolls lore
[0:55:53] friendliermitch: What happened to Falstad Wildhammer?
[0:55:54] Mja00: danChat
[0:55:57] murrsu: @meh_ninja_please I played so much GW2, from closed beta onwards until I quit about five years ago. Really good game

[0:56:05] andaroo: @AncientSteltek Technically the back end of WOW has gone through 3 major upgrades, so no
[0:56:06] kokochris: @hashpipe EQ was perfection; they nailed it.  I mean we called it evercrack for a reason
[0:56:08] LeratoFodon: hey! danKEK2 danHug danLove
[0:56:09] bgriff87: danNodders How I play

[0:56:17] Fallenstarss: their quests are so good
[0:56:19] WeeMr_Goodcat: @AncientSteltek similar, but no. the newer zones are much higher fidelity, this is literally the grpahics from 18 years ago
[0:56:19] alsorrr: FF14 is also basically single player MMO
[0:56:19] McGerr: @BrutalxBarbie Good game
[0:56:20] jackalo34: andaroo u forgot osrs but ye :)

[0:56:30] jaxmaru: the gameplay of ESO is what irks me
[0:56:30] hashpipe: @kokochris looking forward to pantheon or monsters and memories more?
[0:56:38] kasded: @alsorrr They make you party up though.
[0:56:40] mondtier22: i like multiplayer :)
[0:56:41] retrofunkgg: @dansgaming use concussive shot next time
[0:56:43] moxxzor: @meh_ninja_please i've only played a little WOW but i still liked GW2 more
[0:56:44] andaroo: @andaroo WOW's is snappy enough that there can actually be competitions and Wyldstar had really great combat so.. not necessarily?
[0:56:44] murrsu: Also ESO has Stibbons
[0:56:46] roy_o_: Yeah questing in ESO is really good
[0:56:49] Alexlistair: does it have good magic at least?
[0:56:52] EtruriaK: Becuase the npc hates boars :)
[0:56:58] Zimmy99: And most quest lines end in  killing a boss in a delve LuL
[0:57:02] mondtier22: D:
[0:57:10] kasded: @Alexlistair The big MMOs in my humble opinion all have good music
[0:57:22] talisaurus: I love all the little stories in each area
[0:57:23] DoomzDay_313: @murrsu Hyperwow
[0:57:23] Nazzmul: surely you will get a cat named tifa as a pet right
[0:57:33] alsorrr: @alsorrr yes, but it's all automatic, rarely a word from another player
[0:57:34] GettingHut: It feels like an Elder Scrolls game, but online
[0:57:34] SerbentD: F76 feels the same way
[0:57:37] Zimmy99: The stories are usually fun danNodders
[0:57:40] CrowCawl: and soon enough all MMOs will have bot filler characters

[0:58:33] kowabadie: kowabadie subscribed with Prime. 
[0:58:35] Stratigamo: As for ESO's combat: at it's core it's decent. The problem I have with it is the normalization pass they did so everything scales. Battles just feel very "same" from one to another without much difficulty variety.
[0:58:35] AncientSteltek: @andaroo @WeeMr_Goodcat Thought as much that it would be a lot of work having two engine looks at the same time. Has the major advantage of having not too high requirements for the players.
[0:58:38] FlamingSQUIRTLE: Actually it's the running AND jumping game
[0:58:38] metalwrath22222: Kirgan as a warlock, I can't relate 4Head

[1:00:16] raynackermann: Yeah I hope the cata classic changes keep it more old school like classic is now.

[1:01:50] valianya: Retail WoW is pretty much a different game from Classic.  The world and characters got a graphical overhaul, the gameplay is faster and more varied in abilities, quests are more collected in hub locations, there's a guided storyline, events and things that make it more theme-park-like
[1:01:50] Kalderasch: "Do you desire that I break you?" taken out of context

[1:14:46] BOXakaJOEMOVES: The one thing WoW was always consistent with was it's Cinematic Trailers, STILL best in the business when it comes to that
[1:14:47] SgtStruthers: Mobas where you can blame other when you lose
[1:14:48] freetherocktv: @Molehj not true at all, classic is much easier to get into than retail, my guild has tons of new players raiding MC that have never played WoW before and are having so much of a better time than LFR KEKW
[1:14:53] Fuzzymatty: they are too hard and people went to moba games
[1:14:58] shaneshane: consoles too, cant make good RTS games for 360 or PS3 so was pc only devs
[1:14:59] meh_ninja_please: C&C and Warcraft were my jam as a kid
[1:14:59] esoterious: dota and league are more accessible to a new player, being a new player on RTS is so overwhelming imo, on league you can at least jungle and take it slow etc
[1:15:04] GamerKillance: Oh did dan die?

[1:15:21] SoulCrusher842: Total War: Warhammer 3 probably one of the top RTS games

[1:15:22] talisaurus: HELP HIM D:

[1:17:06] rudii_lv: Wash it I will
[1:17:08] Empac: so how does dungeons and raids work in hardcore? like if you die in raids or dungeons, do you have to start all over again?
[1:17:09] glauber_87: To be fair, i always choosed my crap talents =p

[1:17:19] Rygem: @winsseli enjoy getting declined for raids KEKW
[1:17:22] esoterious: i ran heroics in retail tbc way back when with a smite build priest, and he did competitive dps in 5 mans compared to dps classes without raid buffs
[1:17:36] Anthy1887: I really like the current talent system from retail with a two talent trees, 1 for class, 1 for spec
[1:17:37] Wrannec: @Empac Yep :)
[1:17:40] esoterious: was pulling like 1200 single target on bosses, which for 5 mans back then was really strong
[1:17:41] glauber_87: @Rygem Not everyone plays for raids bro
[1:17:47] Deadlegacy1337: guzuComfy
[1:17:52] GamerKillance: They should just add seasonal servers with retail rewards. Keep resetting for new seasons and make it a esport race to see who can kill whatever first again with rankings
[1:17:55] WaIes: not having the one right build was actually seen as griefing, and they were kinda right because youd perform at 50% or worse with the wrong build
[1:17:59] GamerKillance: Similar to D3 seasons
[1:18:00] Wrannec: So many Onyxia deaths
[1:18:01] ÁÆáÈßÑÁõÆ„Åæ„Çä„ÅÆ: WoW heads are just too much into min max and metas for those who plays everyday for 15 years

[1:18:11] haquilo: danKEK3
[1:18:11] 000000000000000000_CSLUL: @Empac you die in any way you star over. but people in raids use petri flasks, which means a few people die but 95%+ survive wipes
[1:18:16] freetherocktv: @DansGaming did you see a guild almost full 40 man wipe in naxx a couple days ago?
[1:18:19] stickerey: just alt+f4 and never look back Kappa

[1:19:13] Empac: better have a soulstone on you lol
[1:19:15] Lv9999Dragon: healers better be on adderall and coffee in raids
[1:19:17] Azathul: its the fear of dying that adds excitement and thrill
[1:19:18] Wrannec: @p4prikek To each their own. Some people want whats the best and dont want to feel they are doing something wrong

[2:04:13] GaryEnkelis: Why would you want to beat WoW?
[2:04:13] Cfcampbell24: game would need a complete software redo for 4K settings or details etc
[2:04:14] SoulCrusher842: MMO's are meh and getting into a new one is hard
[2:04:15] lFronk: But guys, there's a new wow- killer coming soon COPIUM
[2:04:15] cosmin284: wow is fun a lot can't wait for season of discovery
[2:04:17] Bezzay: WAYTOODANK oldschool RS
[2:04:19] sMoKe2501: TBH the guy isnt wrong, not the best wording, its like what IFronk just said. Its like paying for Madden every year, youre +1'ing what they push out by supporting with $$$
[2:04:19] Xaedrik32: I'm still confused as to why Wildstar failed
[2:04:20] Oin32: unless you swipe your credit card
[2:04:20] Zimmy99: They cost a lot upfront investment
[2:04:22] try2handing: so... people got wow'd
[2:04:22] zacksmith: I've been hearing "wow killer" for over a decade
[2:04:24] SaTiNa99: wasn't WOW passed by final fantasy xiv has the number 1 MMO?
[2:04:27] Zrudge: Game been around and super popular for 20 years. Has to be shit right? macawWhatever
[2:04:30] VrtniPatuljak: no one talks in mmos any more, world has changed
[2:04:31] alsorrr: Ashes of Creation will save us COPIUM
[2:04:31] shaneshane: blizz done their best to smother the mmo genre, wows success defo hurt the genre
[2:04:32] DotaKaiser: wow was just 1st and people stay on wow bcs they are addicted to it
[2:04:33] doinglurkstuff: Their questing and raiding style has been copied quite a bit. I do wish that the graphics were different. Just does not appeal to me.
[2:04:35] Dega___: @SaTiNa99 no
[2:04:35] Eraste: blizzard proved a couple years ago only they can kill WoW
[2:04:36] Mysticryu: I would say Final Fantasy 14 is the closest
[2:04:37] Munzies: HC is the closest ive felt for the 2005 nostalgia
[2:04:38] LoneRobo: FF14 is fantastic NODDERS but you gotta get through the first part to get to the great part
[2:04:39] abbosss: its a bygone genre
[2:04:40] NerdIRage: we can try to re-capture the magic but it was definitely 'of its time' due to other gaming experiences not reaching that level
[2:04:40] sch1z0: wow has to fight its own nostagia
[2:04:41] Dontthinkson: with the Battle Royale/ seasonal mind set people dont have the long game in mind anymore.
[2:04:41] trip_ma: so many "WoW killers" came and gone
[2:04:41] Kazutsu: I currently play ff14 and enjoy it but I do wonder what will the riot mmo be like
[2:04:42] zinkn: They could just up the graphics and keep releasing new expansions
[2:04:43] fxzues: OSRS was my WoW tbh, i was too young and poor to play WoW lol
[2:04:44] abbosss: unfortunately
[2:04:44] SoulCrusher842: It's such a time consuming genre to get into.... that's not popular these days
[2:04:44] NerdIRage: now theres lots of games that reach that experience
[2:04:49] drlucifurr: @SaTiNa99 Nope just alot of streamers played it, they have all since left lol
[2:04:51] meh_ninja_please: ive put thousands of hours into GW2. love the combat and writing is decent too!
[2:04:52] ColonelGumby: No but it's so fun :D
[2:04:54] CruncheeSnacks: WoW mastered the rhythm of this type of combat... no other MMO matches it in my opinion..
[2:04:56] Falsa1122: @DansGaming thanks for helping me i was the dwarf hunter againt the bear <3
[2:05:00] Dragtox: many mmo forget to create a good progression system and ofc balance both end game and  getting from 1-max lvl gameplay experience

[3:31:20] SuhDude: athene best pally in the world
[3:31:21] WabbitHatter: in pandaria i hated seeing the monk class deal almost the same dps as my mage, while also tanking the enemy and healing himself while doing it

[3:32:04] trash_kitty: For those of us who never played WoW how would you explain the big changes that happened from Cataclysm onwards?
[3:32:19] Toon11: would have been funny if people's corpses weren't removed, this starting area would be filled with corpses
[3:32:19] Cruduxy: danS
[3:32:21] Dega___: for now
[3:32:24] Crabby654: is this the second hunter? or third?

[3:32:51] trip_ma: cross realms killed communities imo
[3:32:53] darkaurora459: Trolls got him danFine danB
[3:32:54] doctor_mav: @trash_kitty The original WoW dev was fired and replaced by Ion, who's still the dev to this day
[3:32:54] Alloces: spare some change!
[3:32:57] bingo_bongo_me: It's when WoW died, basically.
[3:32:58] Toon11: cata is also when they did the first graphical update
[3:32:59] Traglc: @trash_kitty they changed the talent trees. was a big issue
[3:32:59] funksdelic: the end of Wrath was the end of WoW
[3:33:00] isomore: @toon11 or have a little blood stain like dark souls
[3:33:01] Cruduxy: they put everything on fire or water
[3:33:05] fatalityphase: some of the plaguelands got healed
[3:33:06] Biggs_: @trash_kitty its easy the best days were vaniila, bc and wotlk,, after that it died
[3:33:07] thechzburglar: Legion was good, Demon Hunters are fun
[3:33:08] Miss_cherry: RIP Auberdine
[3:33:08] chippye: also flying everywhere
[3:33:13] Norrak1: Quest wise most zones were amazing
[3:33:13] RidersOnTheStorm: destroyed westfall
[3:33:14] Torse9: a lot of those zones had nothing in them anyway
[3:33:16] the_Zephil: Thousand needles danCry
[3:33:18] MissMokoko: danSad cata made me stop playing for a long time
[3:33:19] Anthy1887: WoW has multiple eras, big changes every few expansions
[3:33:19] Norrak1: Self contained stories
[3:33:23] Rimy: transmog was a blessing though
[3:33:27] gihsh: arthas brings the feels for sure
[3:33:27] noo3zz: Lich king is goated
[3:33:30] Torse9: @the_Zephil It was so empty danCry
[3:33:30] Cruduxy: Deathwing is in warcraft 2 danStare
[3:33:30] Sardren: @DansGaming One change that IU will defend was Desolace, that was one place that got better
[3:33:32] funksdelic: IceCrown Citadel still best raid
[3:33:32] Rogue77: The Shattering was a great prequel book to Cata
[3:33:33] Crestofragnara: 07
[3:33:34] Rygem: yeah but cata is fantastic if you don't have that nostalgia... as in it is objectively great.
[3:33:35] Crestofragnara: o7
[3:33:41] Dolrick: the zone revamp wasnt TOO bad, it made the game evolve... but the talent tree going from "build some funny shiz" to "yeh uhhh you have to pick that ttalent for pve or that one for pvp, that's it" sucked
[3:33:42] StudyBreakZ: danF
[3:33:44] Zimmy99: some zones were much better after Cata though danHmm  more coherent story
[3:33:45] Carandith: for my guild it was the separation and of 25 and 10 raid it was a mess
[3:34:03] funksdelic: I played since Day 1, even left work early and I haven't played WOW in a year
[3:34:04] Osheru: What server you playing on, Dan? I'm thinking of coming back and trying out HC.
[3:34:05] Torse9: @Rygem It is, people just love to hate on it, the fanbase was starting to get too old to like change
[3:34:06] Anthy1887: @Rygem to me it is far better than wotlk SHRUG many people hate it because it killed their guild/raid
[3:34:16] Merlin4421: I enjoyed that underwater zone in cata
[3:34:17] Kisswani: @Carandith that was in LK tho
[3:34:18] WabbitHatter: i think one of my favourite raids was the one where the whole raidgroup was forced to dance :P dont remember the raid name though
[3:34:18] gihsh: where my vashj'ir bros at? uldum still my fav though
[3:34:19] Z3Fire: They must keep Koch king and cata classic to separate server.Not everyone liked cata
[3:34:21] Norrak1: @Zimmy99 Seriously the self contained zone stories were amazing
[3:34:23] Sardren: Cataclysm was almost 13 years ago
[3:34:27] Rcounter: @trash_kitty it changed for in warlords, when they introduced bases. All the major cities where empty and little social interaction. people stayed in their bases because it was a 1 stop shop.
[3:34:30] funksdelic: I would still be playing WoW if it didn't cost $20 a MONTH
[3:34:35] doffy90: Cata launch dungeons were haaaard tho
[3:34:36] Zimmy99: Norrak1 yeah i thought so as well danNodders
[3:34:52] funksdelic: Gamepass > WoW
[3:34:53] sithius75: @doffy90 i liked that
[3:34:57] fatalityphase: I hope Cata classic keeps pre-nerfed heroic dungeons
[3:34:59] snodytoo: raided hardcore but after a year of that it started feeling like a job
[3:35:00] Cruduxy: I don't know what everyone hates in the new thousand needles so much
[3:35:01] Zakaluka15: cataclysm raids were kinda uninspired
[3:35:01] CyorZ3: college
[3:35:03] doffy90: @sithius75 me too
[3:35:04] Lupercal86: first few cata raids were boring too
[3:35:04] bgriff87: danAware adulthood
[3:35:06] Adubbyaherd: You are not prepared!!!
[3:35:08] Alanaze: The good thing about Cataclysm was the more interesting quest system imo
[3:35:10] Kisswani: I took my first wow break because of spine of deathwing LUL I hated that fight
[3:35:11] Rygem: FIrelands though
[3:35:14] doctor_mav: @Rygem It's legit to dislike WoW from Cata onwards. It turned into a completely different game with less RPG and MMO aspects and more action-based and lobby-multiplayer
[3:35:22] IBiggumsI: danOld
[3:35:24] kaiz1337: What about TBC?
[3:35:26] CplDanjou: Was it in Cata that Goblins became a playable race?
[3:35:26] WabbitHatter: what got super boring for me was the mythic dungeons. or whatever they were named.
[3:35:27] gihsh: @Cruduxy I love that zone...the dead giant shark thingfreaks me out still. love running around underwater
[3:35:27] sithius75: also, last cata raid lasted way too long
[3:35:30] Kineticbomb: Deathwing was before the lich king but he's way too old for people to remember. WoW continue the story with Arthas and lich king.
[3:35:30] Carandith: @Kisswani wasn't there some 10 people exclusive raid in cata and other 10 or 25 ? can remember the issue was maybe more int he way our guild did raid
[3:35:36] Kennaay: @Kisswani Worst boss in wow history, even trying to do it now is an absolute pain
[3:35:37] Cruduxy: gihsh I love the ship bar
[3:35:39] wawila: Cataclysm had Mastery and defined specs
[3:35:48] Adubbyaherd: Black Temple was my favorite
[3:35:50] procyon_mfc: it was super fun to see the changed world for about a year
[3:35:52] DuckCrusade: danOrc zug
[3:35:54] Kisswani: @Kennaay yep , I only killed deathwing last month LUL
[3:35:57] Hazuzu83: What do you think about Cata Classic coming out?
[3:36:00] Rcounter: Legend was amazing.
[3:36:03] emoteonly: I can't wait till we can eat some BBBR
[3:36:05] BlankArkadian: danChat
[3:36:08] Hoothor: The Vanilla world was mostly timeless. It was generic enough that it would fit in at basically any stage of the lore. The Cata revamp very specifically took place during Cataclysm, and it was really weird how you'd start off in Cata timeline, then have to go back in time to do TBC and Wrath levelling content with no story justification, and then come back to Cata for the endgame. It made the world feel super... video gamey.
[3:36:08] epiphany79: What happened to the other hunter ?
[3:36:13] cr0wndcl0wn: Died
[3:36:16] thereisacow: Onward to victory! danGuard

[3:36:55] meh_ninja_please: TonySopranosGabagool same tbh but somehow i can spend 8 hours a day watching dan. weird huh LUL
[3:36:57] fatalityphase: classes were really fun in Cata as well
[3:37:07] kimba274: @Kvetch00 that should be an achievement
[3:37:17] Cruduxy: TonySopranosGabagool unless you are racing for world first none of  it matters can just do whatever you want like collecting pets or fishing instead
[3:37:22] Rygem: @Hoothor I started at Cata, And going from 1-60 cata Azeroth into Outland was so jarring lol. Game felt so bad. questing suddenly felt like a chore.
[3:37:22] doctor_mav: I want to go back to play WoW HC so much, but if I resub, I'll fail college 100%
[3:37:26] MageDaemon: Prayge

[3:37:57] RaptureRiot: ventrillo
[3:37:59] Aerodozz: Ventrilo is a throwback
[3:37:59] Rygem: yes
[3:38:00] Kisswani: @Carandith I dont think so , Cata had Bastion of Twilight which was 10/25 , firelands , 10/25 and the deathwing raid 10/25 . I think
[3:38:01] RaptureRiot: havnt heard that in a while
[3:38:03] Robodope: it respects your time more these days
[3:38:04] Cruduxy: It still does

[3:38:39] Hoothor: @Rygem Exactly. The quest design for the revamp was mostly better, fewer 'collect 10 bear asses' quests, but going from that to quest design from 5 years prior in TBC just made it all feel worse.

[5:36:04] Entropystachio: find a large what
[5:36:08] TheSteventh: @luckygun also the idea that its a trade makes it so that if a person doesnt have those they dont deserve love which is nonsense

[5:36:40] LuckyGun: @TheSteventh uh sure man, you're 100% right. and different people will value those differently. For some, looks take a front seat versus intelligence, or emotional maturity for example. But the sum of those things, together, must match the summation of the partner's qualities, or the relationship isn't equitable and thus non sustaining. I've VERY much not saying people don't deserve love, just that they need to find their happy equity. Misery continues until that founding concept is understood.
[5:36:40] Empac: find a rare boar and tame that
[5:36:41] Misterbaits: yeah spank em with ur rod
