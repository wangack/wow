[2:48:09] Chrimz_: You do
[2:48:20] machine_723: you do not
[2:48:25] Stamstedet: you cant do pvp at 60
[2:48:27] kidneyysnatcher: no you have to becouse there are 60 lvl dungeons
[2:48:29] moonglazzer: you dont

[2:48:37] emaol84: ask the guild
[2:48:47] neugassh: They do raids at 60 and if they die its a delete
[2:48:49] Chrimz_: If you die in a 60 dungeon or like a MC you have to delete
[2:48:51] FlyingKangaroo_: u can decide if want to continue HC or not
[2:48:57] machine_723: only if you plan on raiding in the HC guild
[2:49:20] Djinx_o: No you  can choose between keep playing HC endgame, or just play your 60 normally?
[2:49:30] machine_723: yes they raid
[2:49:35] Chrimz_: Yeah, then you have to delete
[2:49:36] Berniejogo: Yeah, you raid in HC Elite
[2:49:46] merantie: i think all lvl 60 hc players continue hc after reaching 60
[2:49:54] Berniejogo: HC Community is a leveling guild.
[2:50:04] Berniejogo: Some of our 60s have moved over to HC Elite.
[2:50:37] Berniejogo: SOme choose to GO AGANE instead of endgame.

[4:00:57] HooblerLive: what happend to the mage? got any death clip? :D
[4:00:58] Vahri: Yea you gotta pay taxes on what you get back though
[4:01:12] Vahri: If you paid at cost instead, youd save cause you wouldnt pay taxes on the part you didnt spend

[4:02:07] ReykooTv: the enchanting wands are just op
[4:02:27] SpidercowSD: A trend is streamers gifting large amounts in hopes some of those become recurring once the gift is up. If you have the viewers and money it‚Äôs not a bad strategy
[4:02:28] timebandit2023: @vahri hello

[6:50:02] Spart4nm4n: When you sign on to Darkspear, they cower in fear at the sight of your epic gear and Dara Mactire. The hunters lay down their traps and rogues use their saps, but all you need is a thunder clap to prevent flag caps. In BGs when you play as prot, you find all the bots despite warlocks casting their DoTs, you kill them with one shot. I'm not saying I'll be your wife (but when you can't circle strife...) YOU NEED SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU BACK LIFE!
