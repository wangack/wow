[0:10:56] maxmullier: new game ?? tommykLUL after warhammer perhaps
[0:11:18] ramz9900: terrain type, could be swamp or mountain, etc
[0:11:30] Agileos: @TommyKayLIVE i cant use my head, i havent subbed long enough for you to teach me how

[0:12:22] ramz9900: That is exactly how I enjoy WH3 hahaha

[0:13:40] RicTrash: Vermintide end game event coming? So many rats, it looks like it
[0:13:43] WarmasterHenrik: No WoW stream Sadge
[0:13:58] prolhty: @WarmasterHenrik PogO
[0:14:06] Pizzadoxx19: stupid fucking game, all 3 of them are the same game, literally he same
[0:14:08] seppoveri: what is the achievement
[0:15:03] seppoveri: the long campaign win ? If so damn thats rough, i have hundreds of hours in this gave and never gotten the long victory
[0:15:28] mahomm14: Bro why are non subs still chatting
[0:15:40] PabloTescobar26: @seppoveri I think he has a mod that gives him the achievement for doing different victory conditions
[0:15:46] chaosdds: yes this map looks way bigger than the others. but is it?

[0:16:15] ramz9900: 1500 hours in wh2 and almost 600 in wh3.. still have not won a full campaign. It just becomes a tedious job and loses its fun
[0:16:20] Mannrik: map is like 2x larger than warhammer 2
[0:16:24] Sparxz_Live: im playing an empire legendary campaign and i can tell you all games are most definitely not the same
[0:16:25] FedeTira: @TommyKayLIVE on top of the minimap you have shortcuts to armies/cities/heros etc
[0:16:35] RicTrash: Check events on the top bar. One of them should be "The end is nigh" and it says which one it is. It does look like Vermintide might spawn, all the cities with undercities will be in big trouble
[0:16:37] chaosdds: @Mannrik damn son that big

[0:25:08] Rapax550: @Feedbackgaming no
[0:25:11] Koberinoo: thats ur problem these achievements are not meant for player like u.. and u pursuing them is ruining ur enjoyment of this game
[0:25:21] slickhitta: KKona walls
[0:25:38] 90xbliqs: mexico wall
[0:25:38] lukastln: I put walls almost everywhere in mine, AI is so fucking annoying

[0:26:19] Jackalope115: that was a stupid take you are right tommy
[0:26:47] keprilol: idk man achievements are supposed to be challenging but not to the point where it feels like a chore to do them
[0:26:47] lukastln: Bad example
[0:26:48] slickhitta: WOTT
[0:26:58] 90xbliqs: luka speedrun timeout

[0:28:23] johnsnus00: was that fake one or a real one?
[0:28:24] Mike_420: problem is they are challenging by being annoying
[0:29:03] Koberinoo: @keprilol thats why they made same achievements on hard and very hard for players who want a challange and people who want a regular game
[0:29:06] PabloTescobar26: KEKW
[0:29:07] PenguinoPewPew: Will you have teeth left at 40 Kappa

[0:29:32] PabloTescobar26: Anti player bias is such a fun and balanced mechanic Kappa
[0:29:33] kozbringerl: Stare
[0:30:03] Mannrik: these achievements arent made for fun they are for slaneesh cultists irl who take pleasure from pain
[0:30:07] siewcasmiercii: LETSGO we are so close
[0:30:16] GeminiRedheart: These rats are so stupiud KEKW
[0:30:20] JakkForst: walls best unit?
[0:30:21] Mike_420: True
[0:30:43] Rowboat_Gorillaman: Late game is not even enjoyable anymore in most of these games
[0:30:45] keprilol: @Koberinoo yes true, but harder difficulties dont make the game harder in terms of ai being competent, it just inflates what it has and it defeats the purpose of being challenging by just throwing stuff at you instead of outplaying you and that is what is a personal turnoff for me, but to each their own i guess
[0:31:15] sammyB88: @tommykaylive these new total war games suffer from that especially there’s very little tactics or strategy after the early turns
[0:31:35] Koberinoo: @keprilol as I said there are die hard fans who enjoy them and wants these kinds of achievemts they are not made for u or tommy
[0:31:41] sammyB88: @tommykaylive just level up your main army and it’ll just auto resolve crush everything

[0:33:03] peifra: @TommyKayLIVE you also need one settlement in desolation held by mummy mommy
[0:33:04] TheVolfas: @TommyKayLIVE Do you need crookback mountain to have full province for achievement?
[0:34:12] AstroKnight5: How does game request work?
[0:34:56] PabloTescobar26: AI doesn't get smarter, it just gets buffed to the point they're broken
[0:35:01] Dwalog: maybe skarband legendary, sure you have his achievement but i think he is easier than other?

[0:37:25] keprilol: @Koberinoo you say achievements are not for tommy or me, but i literally played the games since shogun, if im not a diehard fan then who is
[0:37:35] Dwalog: only one city left
[0:37:47] Koberinoo: @keprilol u can get same achievement on lower difficulty its his own fault

[0:52:19] slickhitta: @MindPrayer i know thats not what you are saying here, but its what people pushing the 'ukraine should give up agenda' say.
[0:52:23] Dwalog: they also want charkiw
[0:52:35] Rowboat_Gorillaman: Russkies themselves said like 15k I believe, so you can double or triple that for the real numbers

[0:53:03] noxcis_: they problaly dont publish the real numbers
[0:53:09] todd_mcgo: There is so much fake news online, we won't know definite losses until long after the war i think.
[0:53:15] iteryn: you have to look at OSINT sources, they tend to be the best and on the ground
[0:53:16] keprilol: take it with a grain of salt, if the losses are like that russia would lose all its military population in a year
[0:53:16] JohnTheTurtleMa: Wagner lost 50k dead and wounded  for Bahmut
[0:53:16] paradoxia411: imagine spending 30k lives for what?
[0:53:20] PenguinoPewPew: you wont get any true numbers, you cant use the numbers of russia/ukraine
[0:53:23] ramz9900: Yeah, conscript waves ..

[0:53:32] Mike_420: quick loot KEKW
[0:53:36] Rowboat_Gorillaman: Life is worthless in russia, thats just how it is
[0:53:38] nesrof_u: The problem about Russia they have infinite manpower
[0:53:41] siewcasmiercii: Classic Orcs
[0:53:42] bettenlieger: org rush from tommykay
[0:53:46] Witzz2: Probably true, atleast in some battles
[0:53:46] ramz9900: I know, I see the world in hoi4 now.. I can not help it
[0:53:48] jassafstuhldichein: it will take some years before we will know the real scope
[0:53:49] maxmullier: i read on the news that the Russians started to use old tanks since there are few modern tanks
[0:54:09] DonSteffa: souds like 0% war support from these old men
[0:54:09] nesrof_u: eddiehdDespair war…
[0:54:11] JohnTheTurtleMa: Its the ww2 Meat assult tactics all over

[0:54:44] noxcis_: we need more land lease
[0:54:45] DonSteffa: but if we go in, what about the nukes?
[0:54:54] Astou69: not the war of the west
[0:54:58] PenguinoPewPew: why didnt we help in yemen, syria, lybia, iraq, afghanistan etc?
[0:55:00] VboyChaos: west is always hypocrite
[0:55:02] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Astou69 ?
[0:55:08] noxcis_: there isn´t oil
[0:55:10] Dwalog: i am wishin the west would al least full go on making equipment and fully equip ukrain
[0:55:23] itsRynosuki: I actually applied to military this year due to this, if this happens again i want to be able to support more than what i currently can

[0:55:52] ramz9900: Helping too much in Israel, not enough in Ukraine lol

[0:56:04] kin_seward: thats a nasty drone
[0:56:12] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Astou69 I will not argue with an idiot
[0:56:15] richardnixonn: Predator missile inbound!
[0:56:28] kin_seward: like as much shit as we give them, you gotta admit - they can make some good shit sometimes
[0:56:33] Astou69: @Rowboat_Gorillaman yeah yeah serve in any military and you will see that nobody wants to die for ukraine
[0:56:42] Dwalog: @TommyKayLIVE have you read that denmark now gives urkaine their hole artillery equipment
[0:56:43] Astou69: @AIM_the_Bulldozer nice arg
[0:56:45] slickhitta: EZ  Clap
[0:56:57] iteryn: I hope the AI drone swarms that the UK is sending makes significant contributions on the ground
[0:57:00] nesrof_u: Military Industry must be having a blast with this war…
[0:57:07] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Astou69 at least my argument was true
[0:57:10] ramz9900: Same lol
[0:57:14] bettenlieger: putins russia is like italy in ww2
[0:57:21] Witzz2: Interesting to see the ukrainians producing some western equipment and frankesteining soviet shit with western technology

[0:58:49] nesrof_u: @johntheturtlema How are things in Russia since invasion?
[0:58:51] MindPrayer: @astou69 Tommy basically said so himself a few minutes ago
[0:58:57] gltamt: putins doing artillery only
[0:59:03] sebby1919: it's clear that no one wants to die for ukraine but western governments owe it to the ukranian government and their people to protect them. Why? Western leaders promised freedom and protection from Russia due to Ukraine giving up their nukes
[0:59:04] Rowboat_Gorillaman: Russia is an artillery army
[0:59:08] connornr13: HeyGuys
[0:59:10] JohnTheTurtleMa: @nesrof_u not much
[0:59:15] keprilol: imagine KEKW
[0:59:15] itsRynosuki: kinda scared what will happen once they break this stalemate though, feels like it will go quick
[0:59:20] kozbringerl: imagine being dependant on north korea lol
[0:59:21] JohnTheTurtleMa: I send the fire vid Tommy
[0:59:25] jassafstuhldichein: but north korea sending more shells then whole EU is so sad
[0:59:27] prolhty: OMEGADANCE EU
[0:59:31] siewcasmiercii: EU Classic
[0:59:34] johnsnus00: @jassafstuhldichein true..
[0:59:59] kin_seward: i find it interesting how small every nation's military industrial production is compared to the apparent needs for war
[1:00:01] totalgeekthe1st: the funny thing is, russian artillery could fire way more, but they have so few logistical units to actually support their artillery with the number of shells they would need to fire at full capacity
[1:00:05] kin_seward: you'd have thought it'd be a smaller gap
[1:00:05] Astou69: @MindPrayer said what, it's a fact, nobody want to die for this country, population are tired, and economy wont follow
[1:00:05] PhasedKitten: that’s crazy, thanks for sharing John stay safe
[1:00:24] pinkmeiers: eu should habe send more
[1:00:27] MindPrayer: Where was it @johntheturtlema
[1:00:27] siewcasmiercii: 9k NOWAY
[1:00:29] noxcis_: we have to send more!!!
[1:00:32] 90xbliqs: isnt EU a Economic alliance or is it a military alliance too?
[1:00:33] gltamt: gltamt gifted a Tier 1 sub to itsRynosuki! They have given 4 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:00:41] Shutacon: germany needs to wakeup bruh
[1:00:48] jassafstuhldichein: Germany/US completly outclassed by North Korea
[1:00:49] itsRynosuki: @gltamt oh thanks man! very much appreciated!
[1:00:55] listrong7: Germany focuses more on civ factories
[1:00:58] maxmullier: they passed on the senate, idk know how theyll pass the aid package on congress
[1:01:03] gltamt: @itsRynosuki your welcome
[1:01:15] chaosdds: two years waiting for shells
[1:01:19] johnsnus00: no tommy they use much more then 2k... https://en.defence-ua.com/industries/ukraine_uses_five_times_less_artillery_ammunition_than_russia_rusi-9125.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20RUSI%2C%20in,compared%20to%20russia's%205%2C000%20rounds.
[1:01:20] H4Hollow: bruh thats so far away
[1:01:22] jaki440: less individual moves and more united moves under the eu <3
[1:01:22] ramz9900: FDR, we are failing as the Arsenal of Democracy. We should be sending so much stuff they are drowning in supplies
[1:01:27] CaptainAlex1701: They are already planning deliveries for 2025? Cryzy
[1:01:35] AIM_the_Bulldozer: @Astou69 what person wants more people to go and fight and die in ukraine? just send them more weapons and aid, they would have a much easier time. In the case of the US almost all the money allocated for ukraine was spent in the US to produce new weapons while they sent old stuff to ukraine. This boosts the economy and benefits the US military
[1:01:43] AstroKnight5: North Korea can give 1 million shells but the entire West can give 300k? Thats worrying
[1:01:43] Nightbot: Command only authorised for Kaas
[1:01:56] jaki440: yes it is

[1:02:26] Dwalog: wating for the yes of the congress maybe?
[1:02:33] jassafstuhldichein: would crazy to think that people want this war to continue if you can invest
[1:02:46] darkcha0s_: artillery shells have razor thin margins, not that profitable
[1:02:52] AIM_the_Bulldozer: KEKW
[1:02:58] jaki440: it is
[1:03:09] bearcro123: Tommy just put "chart" after you google the name of the stock
[1:03:12] ramz9900: Yeah, you were saying all the money burned, how much money is made lol
[1:03:18] PabloTescobar26: over 4 years ago
[1:03:21] maxmullier: @dwalog yes but they said no to the border/aid package deal so idk how the aid package itself will pass
[1:03:30] jaki440: i prefer donating to the armed forces of ukraine
[1:03:33] AstroKnight5: Do it than, invest
[1:03:35] johnsnus00: check Lockheed stock lol
[1:03:45] kin_seward: they've been building more military factories
[1:03:49] johnsnus00: SAME!

[1:04:52] AstroKnight5: Watching this and drinking a cold coke is amazing
[1:04:52] flangothemod: the only thing keeping Russia alive and nato away are there nukes
[1:04:55] dnb3_Psych: just let poland loose and its done
[1:04:58] gltamt: their going total mob
[1:05:04] AIM_the_Bulldozer: if russia would not have nukes, they would be a speedbump
[1:05:05] Zyvenix: pepeLaugh russia soon has no civs left
[1:05:06] Jayjo86: nato will only struggle if usa leaves or russia uses nukes
[1:05:10] kin_seward: we'd be the same though, i dont think any NATO country has a better production situation
[1:05:18] Jayjo86: nato would only struggle if usa leaves or russia usses nukes
[1:05:19] Rowboat_Gorillaman: Next year they will activate the Vodkasturm
[1:05:22] Dwalog: after the "election" we will see if putin gos total war with mobilising
[1:05:30] kozbringerl: @kin_seward turkey and poland
[1:05:32] noxcis_: russia is very f*cked i guess
[1:05:33] jassafstuhldichein: thats what i dont get. like we all make fun of how bad they are but on the other hand everyone is like fearmongering ?
[1:05:35] Shutacon: trump needs to go down
[1:05:36] Koberinoo: u prepare for the future
[1:05:37] keprilol: the only real threat from russia is nukes
[1:05:41] mahomm14: The problem is that they are investing billions while EU is not
[1:05:47] J_B______: fearmongering about invasion is necessary to increse p
[1:06:04] jamezero324: If china and north korea joins then what now
[1:06:05] AIM_the_Bulldozer: The way you know russia is near collapse is when vodka factories start being converted to mils
[1:06:07] maxmullier: @tommykaylive I believe they are saying that because of trump saying he would leave nato and what he said recently
[1:06:07] kin_seward: @kozbringerl yea, but I mean like my own country, the UK. we literally would be out of the war so quickly lmao
[1:06:10] shuggyx: @TommyKayLIVE If you want to get real indepth info about his read listen to Elbridge Colby
[1:06:11] jassafstuhldichein: modern hans guck in die luft

[1:09:29] Sparxz_Live: entire german military selling equipment to ukraine on market
[1:09:43] 90xbliqs: Marder 1A1
[1:09:44] ramz9900: Trump does not want any deals to go through, he publicly said. He does not want to let the democrats look good. People dying.. politics still just playing games. It is annoying
