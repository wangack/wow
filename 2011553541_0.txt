[2:00:48] SalmonSnake: What is this case about? Been watching a while but I don't know what he did
[2:01:48] Nihiles1: This kid strangled another kid after grinding with the other kids girlfriend I think. I'm not 100% sure
[2:01:52] rdg_99: His mom is "Missing" and his house was "burglarized"
[2:02:03] Flecked: dude was using minor healing pots

[2:24:20] Nihiles1: Dylan Cigarrete
[2:24:31] NullSets: was cheesecake the wizard?
[2:24:48] rdg_99: How is he just sitting there, letting them say he killed his mom, when he shouldnt even know if she is dead or missing?

[2:30:34] ArduousBow: Then they're questioning them without PARENTS?!
[2:30:37] ArduousBow: This is WILD
[2:30:56] Radund01: Yeah def not friends.  I would give a hobo my compound without a second thought.  Also free crack

[2:49:36] ArduousBow: To him this is a victory, he gets to relive his action.
[2:49:44] uwuphoria: wtf am i listening to
[2:50:29] Nihiles1: Self defense to choke her out. And choke her again when she started moving
[2:50:52] ArduousBow: It's all about justification, he goes on to explain the actual case, that he read about how he knew he had to feel guilty ( so he hides the body ); claims self-defense, for a trauma defense.
[2:50:59] uwuphoria: well it was counter counter self defense cause he went to murder her so she fought back so he had to kill her for real
[2:50:59] ArduousBow: He played it out, rather well for an insane defense.
[2:51:47] Nihiles1: pls dont let him do necrophilia to his moms body. Pls
[2:51:54] Nihiles1: anything but that
