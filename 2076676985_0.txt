[3:49:24] Johnykarate: oh
[3:49:26] Vendrek: Wildstalker is okay...though they are placing Balance buffs into feral/Resto...sad
[3:49:49] rembrandt89: cause druid needed another root
[3:50:44] ashraf_ma: those are choice nods
[3:50:48] itsmeerebuss: im curious of what hunter sp looks like
[3:50:51] blunn0: 3/10
[3:50:52] Lara_TV_: There's a couple that have an ability, but yeah most are passive
[3:50:53] Vendrek: pretty much modifiers
[3:50:55] felstorms: for the most part, but there are some new abilities
[3:50:57] haendicap: basically extra skill tree
[3:50:57] Lara_TV_: Like the warrior one
[3:50:58] ashraf_ma: mostly passives
[3:50:59] ashraf_ma: yes
[3:51:00] volxine: kinda like borrowed talents
[3:51:02] ashraf_ma: not new buttons
[3:51:02] illEvan11_11: theyre not choice, i think you get all of them

[3:51:21] Zeneri: we definately need more binds, theres not enough spells on my dh to fill bars
[3:51:27] ashraf_ma: u get all of them , but some are choice nods
[3:51:28] luriosbael: you get all 11 nodes. choice nodes are still choice nodes
[3:51:31] felstorms: @illEvan11_11 the ones that are stacked on top of each other are choice ndoes
[3:51:40] ashraf_ma: Rogue , warlock & warrior are the best IMO
[3:51:42] rembrandt89: @Zeneri LOL
[3:51:43] thuglynx: pikabooW pikabooW
[3:52:03] luriosbael: @ashraf_ma i think colossus, and the 2 ret ones are the best
[3:52:11] hvk_rhapsody: Itd be more meaningful if they actually locked you into something but thatd never happen in modern WoW
[3:52:13] notoriousztv: the saylayn death knight tree is fucking broooooken
[3:52:14] illEvan11_11: oh okay i think they actually are choice nodes, somebody in vens stream said otherwise
[3:52:15] pix144: way too much math going on here
[3:52:18] capnzac: i think they change visual effect too
[3:52:23] hellfiremetal: depends on class are far as which get active vs passive abilities
[3:52:25] capnzac: they're supposed to make ya look like the class fantasy more or some shit idk
[3:52:27] notoriousztv: dks getting vampiric embrace and burst
[3:52:41] hellfiremetal: warlock gets a lot of things that proc off of current abilities

[3:53:19] notoriousztv: look at dk bro
[3:53:26] AxiomDK: Can anyone link the totem nameplate weakaura?
[3:53:32] ashraf_ma: you get to lean to another spec basically on top of ur main spec
[3:54:48] vanillashake0: what happened to main team 3s
[3:54:57] felstorms: baking offensives with defensives DH-style
[3:55:06] luriosbael: i dont like the idea of feint being a dps button
