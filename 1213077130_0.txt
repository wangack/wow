[0:54:26] TCC_Fury: Also Swifty, when you open WA on the left side when you click on one of your setting you can see little closed “eyes” and the one is open the one you working with. If you want to place them right next to each other click the closed eyes and you can see all of them and put them right next to each other :)

[0:58:22] ZiuXDK: The tremor also only have 50% to remove, dosent it?
[0:58:26] aerobald: 6 secs
[0:58:28] watching_streams_man: drop it earlier maybe
[0:58:30] slats20: Can you rp walk before a fear to avoid running away?
[0:58:35] Zyxo95: yes, instant pulse on drop. so it dispels your party members
[0:58:37] Devin_Almighty: you need to drop it sooner
[0:58:38] aerobald: rank 14 shaman here
[0:58:44] thegreat0phi: it does not pulse on drop in classic, in classic pre drop it first
[0:58:45] desmondmmoore: you gotta put it down preemptively

[0:58:56] superdeerps: drop and spec into 30 yards totems
[0:59:18] daddiiox: @Galdrena its okay, his busy. thank you tho
[0:59:19] thegreat0phi: 40 yards
[0:59:39] aerobald: ....
[0:59:42] thegreat0phi: i think... unless classic is diff
[0:59:43] slats20: its only 40 if you spec into it
[0:59:43] Big_Zum: 1 second before it will pull u out of fear within 4 seconds so not terrible either

[1:00:21] Hedge47th: and see when its grey
[1:00:22] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[1:00:24] JayBinski: spec does not increase range of tremor
[1:00:31] truksonwar: lightning bolt is 30 yards I think, just duel him
[1:00:40] Big_Zum: @swifty put agility totem down and walk away until u lose buff
[1:00:43] aerobald: it's 30 yard radius swift
[1:01:00] aerobald: so technically 15 yes from any side of the totem
[1:01:09] aerobald: RADIUS

[1:06:43] Habbe: u dont need to specify name after #showtooltip
[1:06:45] Gizimoo86: yea i use tooltip on macros
[1:06:45] aerobald: turn on beginner tooltips in settings seriously it gives more details that they remove when u turn it off because they expect a seasoned player to know these things
[1:07:12] ZiuXDK: @Swifty mate, you can just #showtooltip and don't put anything behind, it will take the spell being cast first. Meaning that if your have mouseover Healing Wave, it will show Healing wave.
[1:07:19] aerobald: settings lol
[1:07:23] aerobald: somewhere

[8:40:27] RealDupreGaming: Hey Swifty, been a long time
[8:40:30] Talason: did they nerf elemental mastery batching?
[8:40:40] itta_pupu27: Can you use addons from curseforge yet or do you need to manually install them?
[8:40:44] StreamlineTVx: @Swifty  i miss your old IRL vlogs:(
[8:40:45] residuez: ele is simply stronger, but enhance is more nuanced and fun imo
[8:41:09] Talason: it means you get 2 guaranteed crits instead of 1 when you pop your swifty as ele
[8:41:13] N3yl0: elemental mastery give you 100 % crit on next spell, but you can batch a cast with a shock to get 2 spell crits 100 %
[8:41:16] residuez: elemental mastery still grants you 2x crits if you chain L into eathshock
[8:41:20] smpope: hit p and go to your attack spell

[9:26:10] darkscroll: How’s the shaman open world pvp?
[9:26:30] CakeEmblem: I just had an epiphany, a wow server where once you hit 60 and clear x amount of pve/pvp content you can reincarnate your char as a level 1 with enhanced stats. Endgame content should have x resets only scales (like heroic or mythic and enhanced stats gear drops too)
[9:27:09] gomezyoda: Have a safe night Sasha!!
[9:27:16] ToastLamoan: Say, "Come at me bros - Shammy power!"

[9:53:31] conath2: zygor guide is only 10 dolar a month
[9:53:47] se_ardygon: 25 bucks for an addon is milking players.. For something most classic players knows by heart already.

[9:57:45] theghilliedaussie: @Swifty ***
[9:57:46] dinkie_ttv: same. ended up paying my bank 30$ to block charges from the gym
[9:58:12] unsqueezable: that sounds deliberate lol
[9:58:18] khazroi: wow subscription plans included?

[10:07:10] theghilliedaussie: you'd have to get a normie job then
[10:07:39] 80sHairMetalFan: I keep getting priced out way out of what I'm willing to pay.  It's nuts!
[10:07:48] bodylice: Start corporation. Corporation buys the house. You pay rent to the corporation. Its a business related expense to you, so you write it off since you are the streamer guy. Last step: get tax guy to approve this plan :O
[10:08:05] hopeaintopii: I got super lucky and bought my house literally a month before covid19 hit. Got it for 10k below asking price, now the price is 10k+ above the original price

[10:58:07] Vexiusx: It's cause people are playing hc
[10:58:11] forkrevenge: That's because it's only 40% increased EXP to quests and the majority of your exp is from mobs
