[2:38:53] Nico_vdM: Or you can clear all if you want
[2:38:54] SLOPEiZ: ye, clear that, and ur good for boss
[2:38:55] Kinghorn: I cleared it all
[2:38:56] chrslp: PogChamp

[2:38:59] Kinghorn: eweaseShrug
[2:39:01] Bezroth: mount will spanw in pool on your right

[2:39:07] ripprrooster: why you doing this solo??
[2:39:08] Nico_vdM: Focus on ambushers
[2:39:13] Nico_vdM: For the mount

[2:39:25] SLOPEiZ: @screwyrooey its for a secret mount
[2:39:28] Masqerader: this boss will be the toughest part of the whole thing, and it's still meh
[2:39:31] motorboatingpro: this is the tough one, last boss was very easy, imo
[2:39:41] ripprrooster: @slopeiz at thanks! cool!
[2:39:53] Nico_vdM: No I meant focus on ambushers for you, the mount thing is to answer the other question @Towelliee

[2:41:04] plumpus81: i would
[2:41:05] Dizmal: Whats @Towelliee doing solo?
[2:41:07] jerexify: I would clear, in case boss spawns stuff over there.
[2:41:08] magakigr: should be a little easier
[2:41:18] Ertra: @Dizmal getting the mount from Heroic Plaugefall
[2:41:21] Mecabeast: as long as you dont dip too low during her stun youre good
[2:41:22] Nico_vdM: btw the mount spawns in the slime near the first group of mobs in this area
[2:41:23] Dizmal: ah nice
[2:41:28] Dizmal: ty @Ertra
[2:41:34] Masqerader: id clear it all
[2:41:36] mewkittymon: Clear to be safe
[2:42:17] Nico_vdM: Its the stun that you usually dont get as tank, they overlap with the add spawns
[2:42:18] mrpresbaby: how'd you fix it?
[2:42:19] Sollice: Did he turn on RTX voice?
[2:42:20] gears_that_up: what is he trying to get lol a mount? thought no mount drops in this dungeon?
[2:42:21] Kinghorn: black magic
[2:42:26] Tunkwa: @Towelliee what mic did you get?
[2:42:27] Nehcrom: Yeah i demand keyboard sound!
[2:42:29] Mcfailadin: YEP keys
[2:42:29] Cuddlymanbear93: mr towelie, what thorgast wing is up?
[2:42:29] Mecabeast: i do
[2:42:31] Vaellder: I didn't mind the keyboard at all
[2:42:36] Sollice: RTX voice also reduced a lot of your echo
[2:42:38] langiqc: @gears_that_up  if you solo last 2 boss you get a secret mount
[2:42:44] jerexify: @gears_that_up Secret mount. Solo last two of PF on Heroic or higher.
[2:42:46] mrpresbaby: if only I could get a 30 series card too sadge
[2:42:49] SLOPEiZ: man, i miss old towlie, with the cool keyboard sounds Kappa
[2:42:55] Scoodles91: you dont really need it
[2:42:56] Nico_vdM: I didnt flask or drums
[2:42:58] Sollice: You dont need a 30 series for RTX cvoice
[2:43:01] Sollice: voice*
[2:43:04] OceanManCarter: I solo'd this at 214 on my prot pally yesterday without pots or anything, you'll crush it
[2:43:05] Nico_vdM: Just slapped on 2 oils and off I went
[2:43:05] iKONZ: voice sounds different though
[2:43:11] Kinghorn: I flasked but I was 207
[2:43:16] Nico_vdM: deathly

[2:43:29] Ertra: i think so
[2:43:31] Nico_vdM: The others will be red for you
[2:43:33] gears_that_up: wtf really
[2:43:34] HaloS23: is Auctionator still worth using?
[2:43:37] Masqerader: feroicty
[2:43:42] Kinghorn: if you dont want to die
[2:43:44] Scoodles91: you have to kill the adds
[2:43:50] Masqerader: yes deathly
[2:43:51] Ambersulfr: The mechanics will kill you if you don't.
[2:43:54] mrpresbaby: drums for last boss?
[2:43:54] Nico_vdM: Enjoy the stuns :)
[2:44:11] ShafinTwo: when are servers going down
[2:44:14] ShafinTwo: ?
[2:44:32] Armdel: @demoholic123 like 20 mins
[2:44:45] ShafinTwo: thanks
[2:45:37] Kinghorn: EZ Clap
[2:45:38] Ambersulfr: Towelliee has been tanking for over a decade, if you have difficulty with this it's not suprising.
[2:45:54] Cacos: I'm looking at towelliee's stats and see how scuffed my pala is. I have over 20% haste, and less than 10% vers, my crit rate is also high AF
[2:46:23] Bruzzi: just saw the gift sub from wuzhadin, thank you
[2:46:48] ANDYisMAD: When servers go down?
[2:46:52] TheUnknowing: Is what it is man, not always easy to get the ideal stats @Cacos
[2:46:54] Kinghorn: 20 minutes
[2:47:24] jerexify: And that was the hardest part.
[2:47:50] Kinghorn: yeah last boss is a joke
[2:47:57] Nico_vdM: @Towelliee after you kill the last boss you have to come back to the area where you killed first group of mobs in 3rd boss platform
[2:48:03] Ambersulfr: Rain
[2:48:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:48:05] Nico_vdM: You will see the mount in the slime
[2:48:06] motorboatingpro: your damage is so high, i'd just mow it all down
[2:48:09] Jarlan23: infected rain
[2:48:18] grimblymcgoo: honestly doesnt even matter, margrave is way easier than spider boss
[2:48:20] Ambersulfr: The rain is why I haven't tried on my shaman.
[2:48:25] Valzark: u dont need to clease it does no damage
[2:48:27] jerexify: Rain isn't an issue anyways. Blood DK and I didn't even notice it.
[2:48:45] Masqerader: once u kill the final boss, u come back upstairs to 3rd boss room and when u comeback up just /target curious and pet the slime it will be on ur left
[2:48:49] Arcanewise: dmg is joke, its gonna be ez
[2:48:53] Masqerader: @Towelliee this boss will do nothing to u
[2:49:01] Kinghorn: hah
[2:49:10] mcsaucey03: Do I
[2:49:24] Kinghorn: this was the only mount we didnt know how to get
[2:49:26] Ambersulfr: It's normal for people to start soloing shit for youtube vids when they get bored
[2:49:29] ceranac23: kill adds fast
[2:49:30] grimblymcgoo: They knew this mount was associated with a secret in the dungeon since the Beta.
[2:49:32] ceranac23: and u guchi
[2:49:33] Kinghorn: so 9/0 is officially over
[2:49:39] Nico_vdM: As long you can stay ahead with the add spawns, the boss herself is nothing
[2:49:41] mcsaucey03: Devine Toll is so satisfying when it hits.
[2:49:45] 71Raydrick410: catJAM Time to earn this mount!
[2:49:51] popfizz26: Whats the reason for doing this heroic by yourself?
[2:49:53] SLOPEiZ: @Towelliee people knew the mount came from the dungeon tho. because of mining etc
[2:49:54] chrslp: 2k too much hp :(
[2:49:56] skulldrag03: Have server reste yet?

[2:50:52] Sarcastard: just get adds to 50%
[2:50:53] WebsterLou: only need to solo last 2 bosses
[2:51:10] jerexify: Well, this is heroic, too.

[4:38:06] Sarcastard: when your naughty bits "acidentally " keep falling out every donation/sub.... there be a problem
[4:38:08] Sir_LongJohnJohnson: If your stream is just sitting there shaking your titties around in tiny bikini in a hot tub with no other actual content, then it‚Äôs also basically soft core porn. You literally see that exact same stuff on porn cam sites
[4:38:15] Novaht: now a days you have 13 years old you say they are "18" like no you aint you is 13
[4:38:21] crawcook: Twitch probably doesn't like it either, they just don't know what to do with it lol

[4:51:28] crawcook: It won't work in the long run
[4:51:36] hound0teon: just as long as were not still in the its fake stage
[4:51:37] Lycis: yea its absolute BS
[4:51:38] im_n0t_jezus: nobody lknows yet
[4:51:45] VyNKaSMyN_: they are going to be expelled from the current European League afaik KEKW
[4:51:49] MindKrush: cannot participate in any other leagues
[4:51:54] crawcook: Soccer doesn't work like NFL does .
[4:51:56] VyNKaSMyN_: so they want to basically make their own league
[4:52:01] CrusaderNero: for selected teams, they go away from Champions League and instead play in Super League
[4:52:12] soth_klf: They want to make their own league without being able to be relegated and stuff
[4:52:13] ElPolloBatman: if these teams go through with the superleague they'll most likely get kicked out of every uefa league, which is national leagues as well as cl and europa league
[4:52:13] MindKrush: Also the players may be not allowed to play for their Countries or in the WC
[4:52:19] im_n0t_jezus: PROBLEM is americans own most of those teams
[4:52:19] Moobot: Towelliee has not moved, he is renovating his streaming room over the next month or so. The stream will be scuffed, the audio will be different, but it will be worth it! Soon‚Ñ¢

[4:52:47] im_n0t_jezus: so AUEFA mad that others will get money now
[4:52:48] Cosmolus: The founding clubs decide who plays in the Super League.
[4:52:54] CrusaderNero: yes, if they get it what they want
[4:52:56] im_n0t_jezus: all thge top 13 teams will
[4:52:57] Maydie6066: so the world cup will be without  superstars like Ronaldo, messi
[4:53:00] SonofHorus82: Not if there's a salary cap they wont be.

[5:30:24] pavepawns: they said it would take 7 weeks cause the campaign takes 7 weeks
[5:30:39] pavepawns: but it was clarified to be the reward from the 1st campaign mission
[5:30:41] pavepawns: so 2 weeks
[5:31:20] rocthenite: which i say is avage for people to unlock path finders
[5:31:43] happybooger: originally it was said that flying would be unlocked at the complete of the covenant campaign which is going to take 7 weeks, thats where the disconnect was
[5:31:55] Sarcastard: So.. everyone go Engineering
[5:31:56] wise1k: probably a techincal limitation, "the inbetween" is a pretty loading screen

[6:46:50] TheGaoSora: I bet he just got sick of the leakers
[6:47:25] mavericks312: look at kojima
[6:47:34] CADZtv: 19 years is along time
[6:47:52] Cielos: If you're a creative person, and the company no longer allows you to express yourself in this way, it can become suffocating. I think that's what happened with Metzen.
[6:48:28] amsa92: @Cielos agreed
[6:48:29] Colt_Engineer: idk how the for profit workforce is but when you work 20 years in a government job you're eligible for retirement, and I'd hit the button and work some other place
[6:48:40] Rastailian: no king rules forever, my son
[6:48:55] amsa92: i miss Metzen
[6:49:05] kokochris: It is a huge factor. For both people staying or leaving
[6:49:24] neverbornlucky: Towelliee on netflixs a new series coming out April 23rd  Shadow and Bones I believe. Saw a preview it looks interesting for a netflixs series
[6:49:29] Unciatim: Yea... Metzen was a physical/emot/psycho decision.... plus... family...
[6:49:32] luckfore: sad day :(
[6:49:34] crawcook: I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted a totally new challenge and those are probably outside of Blizzard.
[6:49:50] L1ghthoof: we havent seen tom in years lol
[6:50:02] givmeafrekinname: MISSED A POWER
[6:50:05] givmeafrekinname: oops caps
[6:50:10] kokochris: I have 17 years in software eng.  I can tell you, alot of people stay because of their close co-workers.  A lot of them leave when the group leaves.  Its very common and normal.
[6:50:38] luckfore: i hope they all go to Dreamhaven and make some sick mmo
[6:51:04] amsa92: @kokochris the environment between workers is like everything
[6:51:04] smashwow: we'll get an RTS well before a MMO from DreamHeaven
[6:51:16] kokochris: @amsa92 yup, it really is.
[6:51:25] Wcvechten: I'd kill for a good new RTS tbh
[6:51:32] crawcook: @kokochris True, I also think that. I wouldn't be suprised if we heard him joining Dreamhaven, a lot of those veterans still want to work together.

[6:52:40] adrian_fell: but doesnt it feel like "the writing is on the wall" in regards to Blizzards future
[6:52:48] mavericks312: the only one to take down blizzard will be blizzard\
[6:52:48] crawcook: They probably need a faster success before they can make an mmo.
[6:53:10] TheCliffyShow: People are so doom and gloom.
[6:53:13] kokochris: nah Blizzard isn't dying,  its going through change.  That change can be a good thing.

[6:55:02] crawcook: *wouldn't
[6:55:18] smashwow: currently they've got close to 80 positions open. it's a little concerning when that's about a third of their team
[6:55:24] kokochris: Most dev's ( not all ) want to do something new.  We can get a little bored of the same thing.  We want to design, create, architect, code and bring new products to life.

[6:56:28] kokochris: na OW2 will be successful.  I wouldnt worry
[6:56:43] TheCliffyShow: Shadowlands was the biggest selling PC game ever = WoW is dying.
[6:56:49] crawcook: @smashwow I also consider that a concern, but at the same time it might be just your standard problem of lack of tech workers in general that all industries face.
[6:56:54] Arbszy: PAPA JEFF BibleThump

[7:01:26] dutchie76: yea just saw that @NiLLx_
[7:01:30] Lycis: Blizz just copied FFXIV endless dungeons, what they do best, copying other mmo features
[7:02:04] TheCliffyShow: @Lycis To be fair. Other MMOs spent years trying to copy Blizzard.
[7:02:16] Lycis: Of course
[7:02:55] Lycis: Its great to see that Blizz tries to improve other features of MMOs
[7:03:08] Lycis: not thats a bad thing

[7:04:26] GamerKillance: Ad resay plz
[7:04:28] NILLme: i cant imagine OW without him

[7:04:35] Thoreya: bc something would be realllllly wrong
[7:04:52] kokochris: @Thoreya yup that would be rough
[7:05:03] Tigerklaue: jeff started with wc3 and left after wotlk for titan/overwatch

[7:06:32] crawcook: I still think Torghast could have been better, with a better reward system, more variety in challenges, more cosmetics.
[7:06:53] crawcook: It's never going to be Hades, but they went the easy way.
[7:07:23] Lycis: yea either left it simple like FFXIV 500 floors of increasing difficult
[7:07:47] Lycis: or not make it better in variety
[7:07:59] Lycis: i mean better
[7:08:44] crawcook: I would switch in a heart beat :D
[7:08:48] GamerKillance: Weren't people saying that about NCsoft with people leaving their team? People leaving is easily worth being concerned about with the track record of people leaving companies like that
[7:09:26] dutchie76: whens 9.1 ya think rob?
[7:09:28] tonyr23: Jeff is leaving blizzard
[7:09:47] dutchie76: yea IGN has the article
[7:09:56] dutchie76: 2022
[7:10:12] Lycis: So he isn't behind the idea of overwatch 2
[7:10:15] Lycis: yea

[7:11:01] crawcook: Yeah when it comes to innovation I would guess Blizzard is on the boring side, how long can you work on a new Overwatch hero or map before you have enough and want to move to a project like the RIOT mmo.

[7:12:21] GamerKillance: Lol
[7:12:26] dalaraz: making assumptionssigh
[7:12:29] crawcook: Probably just means OW2 is so delayed it's not worth waiting Kappa
[7:12:29] dutchie76: holy shet @TylerMcN12 100 years
[7:12:30] dinomiyte: lol, people dont know wtf they talkin about lol... always talkin shit and dont know shit
[7:12:49] TylerMcN12: haha its crazy how long i have been subbed
[7:12:49] GamerKillance: Its just easier to say Bloizzard is dying or its a sinking ship
[7:12:57] Lycis: @zivs bc he doesn't like the direction of OW2
[7:12:58] RavenARPG: I personally believe that Blizzard marriage with Activision in the long run is not worthwhile. Yes, money wise at the moment for sure is great, but in the long run.not really and if D4 fails in sales...Adios amigos.

[7:13:25] mizerboy: So is this where to come for the "Blizzard is dying" party?  :)
[7:13:30] adrian_fell: if he wanted to leave blizzard on good terms he probably wouldnt leave in the middle of production of a major release but please keep going on with that copium
[7:13:31] dalaraz: i enjoy it when people make facts out of assumptions
[7:13:36] xideontv: Blizzard  is sinking bad
[7:13:55] Lycis: Yea the reason would be interesting
[7:14:02] Glozki: cant wait for a belular video on this LUL
[7:14:13] SonofHorus82: @randomgoodthing or he had already planned this and was waiting until his predecessor was prepared to take over to leave. Stop talking about things you dont understands.
[7:14:36] YardRage: dead game, dead company. confirmed. Kappa
[7:14:37] Lycis: Why would he leave when OW2 was doing good
[7:14:40] dinomiyte: lol, their it is again... "blizzard is sinking bad" lmao.. cracks me up
[7:14:42] xXSiebzehnXx: Don‚Äôt you jinx us @towelliee LUL
[7:14:55] TheUnknowing: Of course none of us know how it works lol
[7:14:57] Lycis: LUL
[7:14:59] xideontv: as a corporate you dont let go the creator of a major IP
[7:15:01] adrian_fell: @SonofHorus82 no then he would have waited until OW2 was released since they would have known that this would look bad
[7:15:01] Zivs: Well to be fair, it's happening every month, people who have been there for 15 years leaving. It feels bad :(
[7:15:07] Zettabyte: Thanks for the memories Blizzard, RIP REEEEE Kappa
[7:15:11] dinomiyte: people were saying that when nighcraller left
[7:15:13] shale93: people think that people should stay in one company for 40+ years lol
[7:15:15] TheGaoSora: LUL
[7:15:39] SonofHorus82: Save the Ree and the doom for an Asmon stream. Damn people are dumb.
[7:15:43] crawcook: They are just in an interesting spot, they make tons of money, but at the same time there is pressure to ship a new product
[7:15:57] dalaraz: why would one be happy bout something when he can moan about it ? its 2021

[7:15:59] Zivs: It's the fact that they stayed that long, and now are dropping like flies that makes it feel bad
[7:16:01] shmasherd: A creative company with no turnover is a stale company.
[7:16:05] adrian_fell: Chris metzen leaving makes sense, and im glad for him but you cant deny that there was an underlying reason for Jeff leaving like this IN THE MIDDLE OF A MAJOR PROJECT
[7:16:09] RavenARPG: exaggerating like"everything its over" is for sure not realistic, but also say something like "oh jeff left? oh well not big deal" its for sure a big thing, also considering is not an isolated case, this is just another big left in a sequence of top tier managers at blizzard
[7:16:16] robertjordan83: @Towelliee blizz is turning into bioware post the doctors leaving
[7:16:20] Lycis: I mean its bad timing with no statement of Jeff

[7:17:18] xideontv: Activion-Blizzard CEO is a greedy person that only cares about his bonuses. I wouldn't be surprised if people are leaving because of that

[7:17:26] cranjismcbasketball069: @towelliee That's what people used to say about Metzen back in the day
[7:17:31] 24sevn: I wonder if he is going to go over to Dreamhaven with Morheim
[7:17:39] robertjordan83: @Towelliee honestly wow could use some new blood/ideas/leadership. impossible not to get stale with the same poeple leading
[7:17:41] SonofHorus82: @randomgoodthing it isnt? TBC and 9.1 arent major releases? Shouldnt you be in school today kiddo?
[7:17:42] Lycis: WoW sinking since decades Kappa
[7:17:51] VictorAvalanche: i thought they were done putting money in Overwatch anyway
[7:17:55] Glozki: The amount of ppl that dont understand business is astounding
[7:17:57] cineris_3: all CEOs are overpaid
[7:18:07] uawildcat04: @Towelliee is JEff kaplan gonna join dreamhaven you think?
[7:18:08] dutchie76: Help us thank Jeff Kaplan for being the Mercy to our Genji. Thank you for always daring to see the world as it could be.  Also, help us welcome Aaron Keller as Overwatch's new Game Director. We can't wait to continue fighting for the future with you.
[7:18:17] xideontv: check silicon valleys companies in 2020. lots of them took pay cuts because of covid19
[7:18:24] cineris_3: just a reality
[7:18:25] adrian_fell: @SonofHorus82 Overwatch 2 =/= 9.1 but good luck bullying people
[7:18:35] GombiG1: wow is dying for 15 years and blizzard is dying even longer, yet somehow they are still around :D
[7:18:37] deadevan: They should have rotated to newer, younger people ages ago. Game couldve adapted to new generations instead of slowly dying
[7:18:38] Lycis: LUL
[7:18:57] neverbornlucky: Towelliee imagine a CEO working for free just because they love the game wink wink
[7:19:01] dutchie76: Keller also noted that development of Overwatch 2 is "continuing at a good pace," and that Blizzard will begin sharing more frequent updates on the game's status soon.
[7:19:04] Shrenko: Towelliee with the new mic WutFace PogChamp
[7:19:11] 91Niki: and no LFR Kappa

[7:20:09] cranjismcbasketball069: Jeff could retire now more than likely if he really wanted to
[7:20:10] Zettabyte: Kaplan Interactive :D
[7:20:16] Thoreya: hes prob signing with dreamhaven as we speak
[7:20:23] Lycis: KI GlitchCat
[7:20:41] adrian_fell: would be cool if he joined up with Riot and Ghostcrawler on the mmo project
[7:20:46] tposingsnorlax: Time to do layer 8 of torghast on my 162 ilvl vdh
[7:21:22] Lycis: yea would be great veteran devs joining for the big new mmo on the horizon
[7:21:26] JavLive: Are we expecting any PTR updates today? or nah?
[7:21:39] Kaype92: So at this point does Blizzard even own any part of itself as a company anymore?
[7:21:57] Kaype92: This is very ugly news for Blizzard
[7:22:03] pavepawns: i wonder what he is gonna go do now
[7:22:06] Zivs: Im happy for him, I'll just miss seeing him at blizzcon and stuff
[7:22:06] PokerFaceMoose: its good to move forward in your life and career
[7:22:18] adrian_fell: its good for Jeff for sure
[7:22:28] adrian_fell: not so good for Overwatch 2

[7:28:16] CrunkyBrewster: No i mean I thought he left the company

[7:28:30] Broomba: @towelliee -- what time will ony come back?
[7:28:40] dinomiyte: owwwww
[7:28:42] Mr_Pennywise_: ouch#

[7:29:19] MetallicusGaming: we can hear you
[7:29:22] r0b928: Pardon my ignorance but what is the point of that?
[7:29:25] Mr_Pennywise_: your fine
[7:29:41] Shrenko: Shrenko subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[7:29:53] vjmartin5: take the injection, easier on the liver
[7:30:22] CrunkyBrewster: yeah if you look at the early early alphas of wow it was very EQish
[7:30:27] Shrenko: new EU policies had to log into my bank to confirm payment for Prime gaming now @Towelliee
[7:30:55] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah, if you‚Äôre gonna do oral test take something to keep liver enzymes right
[7:30:56] CrunkyBrewster: EQ
[7:30:58] CrunkyBrewster: yu[
[7:31:00] CrunkyBrewster: yup
[7:31:15] crawcook: that sounds horrible lol
[7:31:21] neverbornlucky: remember utlimate online
[7:31:34] SonofHorus82: part of me wants to do that. Just grind out and only do class quests.
[7:31:36] kokochris: I started playing MMO's with Asherons Call and EQ.  WoW brought the theme parkness to MMO's and it worked really well
[7:31:40] CrunkyBrewster: thats how EQ was in the beginning. There were very little in "Quests" in Everquest
[7:32:15] Democritus33: @Towelliee but its false to judge EQ with todays eyes.
[7:32:35] crawcook: I like lore so quests are what makes me want to explore the world.

[7:32:47] huemaahn: I grinded mobs from 1-40 during TBC because I didn‚Äôt know any better
[7:32:50] kokochris: @Democritus33 Tow is saying during the design of WoW (pre vanilla release) they figured this was a better MMO experience.
[7:32:55] CrunkyBrewster: the quests in EQ you had to look it up online, to find the NPC that started the quest, and you had to put in chat the right words to initiate the dialog for it.
[7:32:57] crawcook: If I just want to kill things I go play an fps lol
[7:33:16] luckfore: any new build today?
[7:33:30] Democritus33: @kokochris i know, it was just a completation for other ppl in chat
[7:33:46] kokochris: @Democritus33 oh sorry, I thought u mean what tow was saying
[7:34:44] kokochris: I spent many hours in Asherons Call walking around from town to town trying to find quests or things to do. It was fun for what it was, but it turned a lot of people off of MMO's at the time.  WoW nailed it by having really well defined quest hubs
[7:34:47] pigzip: If wow went the EQ way would have made professions lvl‚Äôing a little easier.
[7:35:17] neverbornlucky: v28 just made oculus quest 2 a much better vr headset. airlink lets stream pc vr wireless now for free

[7:41:28] MightyGaming: so im back
[7:41:47] CrunkyBrewster: Shit i worked for Walmart for 8+ years. that was almost every month at my store
[7:42:16] Necrosack: Montana ---> Young
[7:42:18] pavepawns: @CrunkuTV imagine urself working twice the amount at walmart :o
[7:42:30] pavepawns: thats some scary stuff

[7:42:49] robertjordan83: @Towelliee what is chilton doing?
[7:42:56] pavepawns: ye imagine if ya did is what i said
[7:42:58] dinomiyte: fiiiiiiive golden ringssssssss!!!!!
[7:43:33] MightyGaming: i think you dont need it, there other ways to boost your numbers by just diet changing and physical activity. think about it your body produces testosterone naturally and yes it gonna decrease as you get older. but if you stay active as you get older your body will keep on producing it because your body is demanding it.
[7:45:30] Broomba: does it matter why he left?
[7:45:36] Garrujak: If I'm Jeff, all these years of dealing with people meme'ing me as the overwatch killer would likely drive me to go elsewhere
[7:45:44] SonofHorus82: Probably also a mountain of NDAs with his signature all over them too.
[7:45:51] MightyGaming: but once you introduce the trt in your body. your body will rely on it and will stop producing it which will make you stay on trt forever
[7:46:02] Jesperoni: 750
[7:46:06] MightyGaming: athletes have done it and now they need trt for the rest of there life
[7:46:20] ArcaneSyntax: people read way too much into this shit.
[7:46:23] Nanaki_24: jeff kaplan left blizzard D: byebye overwatch xD
[7:46:26] NewWorldReign: Did you read the spoilers about the Runecarver?
[7:46:40] MightyGaming: so i would not take trt first i would fix your diet and be active everyday to force your body to change dont rely on trt
[7:46:41] Tyrou: if you wanna go straight to 225 you need another 700 or so
[7:46:46] x2infinity: Imagine if Ion leaves D:
[7:46:52] MightyGaming: your body knows what its needs
[7:46:58] pavepawns: or maybe CONSPIRACY THEORY TIME he is really a lizard man that has finally been allowed to return to his kin underground and is heading back there super fast to become overlord of his people and start galactic takeover... or maybe he just wanted to do something else
[7:47:02] pavepawns: 50/50
[7:47:02] Necrosack: @Towelliee been overweight thru youth, gynecomastia, low T and depression. I finally got in gear, got surgery, T replacement, diet change and gym. now im in the best shape of my life... and i still play games.  anything is possible.
[7:47:02] Garrujak: you vape no Nic right?
[7:47:03] x2infinity: Tho Idk how bad Ion leaving would even be
[7:47:05] Nanaki_24: @x2infinity hahaha

[7:47:51] buffn99: @Towelliee If you're talking about testosterone, did you ever have an mri done to see if you have a tumor in your pituitary gland? Mine is low and they checked me for one
[7:47:55] MightyGaming: if your number where low at 18-25 years old then i would worry but we dont know you base line
[7:48:02] d3momhunt3r1988: oh damn , so with Jeff leaving that overwatch 2 project won't see the end of the tunnel in quite a while.
[7:48:08] adrian_fell: i feel like Jeremy was being eased into a more public role aka future Ion
[7:48:09] ArcaneSyntax: i actually think Ion is one of the better game director's for wow.

[8:23:28] pixxelina: @nokster yup
[8:24:02] luckfore: Twilight Devestation was fun as fuck
[8:24:19] MrTerkyMan: It feels bigger than it is cause we've come up with the game hearing the same names the whole time but at some point, people that have been on the same project for 15+ years need to move on

[8:24:43] thatguynamedjans: @Towelliee  Did I miss something? Conduit energy?
[8:25:18] Rossii77: you should be able to regenerate or buy more of it
[8:25:21] Denitor79: you didn't get sash there? that shit is so fun to play with
[8:25:52] RoboMaximillion: the energy used to change conduits at the soul bind table @datguynamedjans
[8:26:25] thatguynamedjans: @Towelliee  Lmao, I slotted the BiS conduits and never touched them so I completely forgot about that lol. Now that Im thinking about it, it does seem completely unnecessary and absurd. @RoboMaximillion
[8:26:45] RoboMaximillion: yeah it's dumb
[8:27:25] ShadyWizWolf: Nah keep her there. She'll be fine.
[8:27:34] RoboMaximillion: it's annoying since I like both frost and unholy
[8:27:59] NewWorldReign: Do you think Jaina forgives the Horde for destroying her city and killing her husband etc?
[8:28:23] Maydie6066: Conduits imo suffer massively from crap synergy between the soulbind abilities and the conduit slots (i.e a good soulbind for your class/spec having 3 tenacity conduits and 1 potency)

[8:28:48] swordart_19: I play ret main and have conduits sets never changed does not stopped me doing any m+ raiding or pvp.
