[6:04:32] bigbongsmoker: for a weapon anyway
[6:04:32] dracullus: CDPR promote their games on GOG but it's never exclusive
[6:04:41] MrTimelordz: Do we know yet what the D4 mount will be when we gift subs?

[6:06:05] fred_birkhoff: yeah ...
[6:06:11] bigbongsmoker: just hope that wepaon carries you until you get a quest weapon @Greastbunny
[6:06:11] Gremmel: They had a bunch of their accounts stolen so some might have bought your GOG account and been using it
[6:06:17] Nokterian: back in 1995 that was a lot you know @Towelliee
