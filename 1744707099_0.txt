[3:24:48] JGussey: Realm list is up
[3:26:12] firehawk73: ez 3 chest
[3:26:28] Yagr6: @Towelliee kinda disappointed in the KSM mount, blizz dropped the ball there! Could have been a dragon skin for this dragon expansion
[3:26:29] its____rooster: @Yagr6 in the wow lore. books, written by a new black dragon scientist named Adamanthia, contain correspondence with Neltharion. In the entries, it is revealed Adamanthia had removed the black dragonflight essence from the Dracthyr, this is why there is no tank spec

[3:28:34] cryonic805: subcreation mplus site is great for copying talents
[3:28:39] tempestmemes: the biggest difference for dh tanks is in class tree not spec tree for keys
[3:28:46] stabzmcgeee: subcreation has a list of builds
[3:28:50] reyvin40: they said they couldn't dispel magic and I know nothing about healers.  I've since looked it up and know they do
[3:28:55] rosina_scarlett: isn't it chest?
[3:28:58] rosina_scarlett: bc dathea chest
[3:29:00] JudicialGamer: for all palllys its legs
[3:29:11] LloydInSpace04: @thanatostf What do you mean?
[3:29:20] Ximora_and_Capy: @reyvin40 :( some cant dispel certain things sure but all healers have something lol
[3:29:22] xHukk: I love when I go to raiderio to look up M+ builds.  And I click on someone..  and they are loaded into their Raid specs..  :O  Gotta be careful and watch for that or you will get GOT.
[3:29:38] belliam99: When is the server coming back up
[3:30:01] Ximora_and_Capy: Yes
[3:30:04] rosina_scarlett: yes
[3:30:05] zkomamuraz: never lol
[3:30:05] Yagr6: yep
[3:30:09] thewolfmans: yes
[3:30:11] biirrd: yes
[3:30:15] EthicalHermit: Alt's do
[3:30:15] tempestmemes: @thanatostf the biggest variation in build is usually sigil diversity if needed or not +/- darkness cd and such , the biggest spec tree difference is taking soul carver in low keys and elysian over fodder for aggro
[3:30:17] BlueBlurPrime: have to farm charge each week
[3:30:18] Ximora_and_Capy: lol
[3:30:25] WundertueteGER: KEKW
[3:30:25] Tyr7: nope u need to collect every week and will stack upto 6 max
[3:30:27] markedrogue_: you do they judst dont show
[3:30:27] kimmo_gaming: i thin there is, but it always says 1
[3:30:33] rollcalling: they gave my 62 lock all 5 sparks
[3:30:39] markedrogue_: It'll always show as 1
[3:30:42] hammack52: yeah if you are an alt on the same account you would just gett the number of charges you have earned
[3:30:46] im_capy: Gotcha game confirmed Kappa
[3:30:53] biirrd: my alt ding 70 one hour after im complated the charge quest for the week.. and did not get the charge =(
[3:30:56] snake_like: wait what? it's accountwide so as long as you do the quest your account gets a charge, up to a max of 6
[3:31:02] llNoTToXiCll: the revival  catalyst is a really great idea for gear reminds me of stat reforge
[3:31:02] TheFiddlerDiddler: If you earn on one character, you earn it on all alts for the week too
[3:31:04] Yagr6: im curious whats going to happen with professions going forward into the next patch
[3:31:04] kimmo_gaming: make a belt
[3:31:05] snake_like: so an alt could hit 70 with 6 charges
[3:31:09] Trobbels: Shield
[3:31:09] Muggshott: There is a visual bug with the Revival Catalyst to always display 1 charge available.
[3:31:16] goldenharpbilly: riiiings
[3:31:17] Brogdan: Frostfire belt for sure
[3:31:17] hammack52: but if you are on a different account or saw on the EU and normal play on NA you would have to earn then for both sepperetly
[3:31:20] Bigbharash: shield
[3:31:20] mor4din: legs or belt
[3:31:22] Tupacthuglyf: @snake_like yes
[3:31:28] zeke_fort7337: are you on EU or are the NA servers up?
[3:31:34] Mecabeast: I think what towelliee is talking about is say you skip a week or 2 come back and do the quest will you have 1 charge or a charge for each week you skipped
[3:31:39] zkomamuraz: eu
[3:31:43] im_capy: belt imo
[3:31:58] rollcalling: go pants unless you have rings. the rings are what make the belt bis

[3:32:19] Yagr6: that would be nice
[3:32:19] Bigbharash: thats how it should work with alts
[3:32:23] Tupacthuglyf: Maybe it was in SL
[3:32:24] Inthezonewow: How it should be
[3:32:29] zoovthepally: can you repeat the quest?
[3:32:29] rosina_scarlett: if you don't have the rings the pants ar ebetter then the belt
[3:32:36] reggiepowa: craft some ring
[3:32:52] Tupacthuglyf: Honestly should just have a vendor with all the gear on it.
[3:32:53] snake_like: kind of wish the max was near infinite like SL. I liked going on alts and being able to get crazy transmog unlocks at the end of season 4
[3:32:53] AlphasaurusRexx: @Tupacthuglyf they did that season 4 slands. gave every character like 30 charges

[6:50:29] Masqerader: yes
[6:50:33] Malarick: save the chests until higher levels
[6:50:40] Masqerader: u get keystones from completing a regular rift
[6:50:40] CeruleanStar: load up a new char real quick
[6:50:43] Malarick: nope thats the rifts
[6:50:44] Masqerader: u can't do gr till max level
[6:50:48] nichromegames: new season out?
[6:50:49] neverbornlucky: Towelliee run rifts and collect the currency to buy weapons
[6:50:49] Gremaldy: You doing this solo or group?
[6:50:59] PossibleFail: Depends how min / max you wantr to be about it @Towelliee . Optimal way is Necro level to 18, then kill a boss for diamonds, then sacrifice those diamonds to the altar to make all gear lose its level requirement, then roll the actual class you want.
[6:51:04] Nokterian: You have two rifts a normal one and greater rift that uses a rift key
[6:51:11] Malarick: max level rifts reward stones that can open greater rifts
[6:51:13] Broomba: whats the current max level of D3?
[6:51:20] neverbornlucky: if you have a challenge rift save it for season open then get the currency and use it to exchange for weapons to lvl faster with gear
[6:51:20] Nokterian: season ended
[6:51:21] jdubz26: u didnt save
[6:51:23] Masqerader: shift click them its faster
[6:51:26] Nokterian: it goes back to base game
[6:51:27] jeflag: shift + left click to add 10 points at once
[6:51:27] DykeBallz95: ctl click does 50 points
[6:51:28] snake_like: crazy to think how old d3 is. feels like it just came out a few years ago despite how much I've played it.
[6:51:30] jjfox92: holding shift will put 10 points at a time
[6:51:47] neverbornlucky: that is the vender you buy from
[6:51:54] hadahui: control did 50 at the time?
[6:52:02] shortshelflife: holding ctrl will do 50 at a time
[6:52:02] CeruleanStar: youd o like bosses or something for normal rift ? then you get a GR key from that ?
[6:52:09] Nokterian: U should see the Wizard Meteor Build that is my favourite
[6:52:11] DykeBallz95: yes
[6:52:22] DykeBallz95: ctl does 50
[6:52:29] hadahui: Seasonal gear might change your build
[6:52:38] shortshelflife: also you have to assign each column, @Towelliee - it was 60 points per column not 60 total
[6:52:44] CeruleanStar: ... we should make a 4x PLD group all with that same build lol :D
[6:52:45] Masqerader: i prefer thorns you're pretty unkillable, its a tanky spec and u smash
[6:52:57] Nokterian: dont forget to get to put stuff in the cube
[6:53:05] neverbornlucky: If you want to find out more Raxxanterax a diablo3 robot. He only plays diablo3 and does it like 24 hours a day it feels like
[6:53:18] dokor: @Towelliee for the season starter you probably want to go fist of heaven build
