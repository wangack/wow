[0:54:31] Drascho27: no you buy flash powder from a vendor
[0:54:38] drthanos911: you can pickpocket all you need
[0:54:47] Drascho27: no
[0:54:53] rookie286: you only would need swifthistle for energy pots
[0:54:57] buffmonkey123: we are all newbs when it comes to hc
[0:54:58] Drascho27: you can buy the vanish powder from a vendor
[0:55:05] caffeinerushhh: you need herb to pick the fadeleaf and your poison skill grinds up fadeleaf into blinding powder

[0:57:11] Robchew: I checked, it's true. Rare though
[0:57:21] shawnquesty: Swifty, stop dying
[0:57:31] Robchew: Maybe do herbalism, farm a lot of fadeleaf, store in bank, and replace profession
[0:57:33] Grouwdi: Hardmode should not allow Addons too :P
[0:57:44] Enitzu: Herb alch is still good in hc
[0:57:49] driski: i would like checkpoints on certain lvls on the oficial servers

[0:58:28] rookie286: too many people trying to gatekeep HC and make everyone follow rules they dont like
[0:58:48] Hyelander_: Hard mode should only allow DSL internet, 15 inch tube monitors and computers with 2004 Pentium processor
[0:58:51] BigDruid_: cant you get in a dead server and get r14 the transfer to a full server after getting ur title and gear?XD

[0:59:16] Snowman_Sir: I can't help you. But I'll cheer you on cohhCheer
[0:59:23] grimwrath1: Can u get enchants from higher lvl players in hc mode??
[0:59:37] caffeinerushhh: not even the difficulty, but grouping because there are 20 people that want to kill the mob
[0:59:47] Jepamaan: just lvl higher and come back
[0:59:57] jhonywalker82: True
[1:00:08] xmedpakx: just make mobs tagable
[1:00:10] Grouwdi: @caffeinerushhh yeah. HardMode is just: you die, it's over. You still play as a normal player.
[1:00:15] xmedpakx: no need to group
[1:00:16] drthanos911: just let tagging for some mobs would make it easyer
[1:00:27] StreamElements: Redeem Points at point store https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[1:00:39] Drascho27: @Grouwdi No, that's not the rules.
[1:00:39] Ernanz: HC is silly anyways
[1:00:40] caffeinerushhh: at hogger last night, there were actually 20 people fighting over the tag lol
[1:00:58] Hyelander_: It is silly to not allow grouping in a multiplayer game that is build around playing with others
[1:01:15] xmedpakx: or 20 get it in one try by letting it be tagable
[1:01:36] xmedpakx: no need to group
[1:01:37] rustyjeep: HC rules werent scale-able.   not designed to support full server of HC toons.
[1:02:00] Drascho27: if you don't like hardcore don't play instead of changing the rules
[1:02:00] lindblad: i like the hard rules, thats why its called hardcore. Too many people want "hardcore" with normal rules, dungeongrinding, buying all gear from ah and so on, then there is really no point
[1:02:22] drthanos911: just for some mobs not all mobs
[1:02:33] quenzar: My first time through the game was in Wrath and NOBODY was helping me do those lowbie group quests
[1:02:48] quenzar: You just have to wait until you out level it or just skip
[1:02:50] caffeinerushhh: disabling trade until 60 would be interesting

[5:26:33] IncinerateGaming: there is an add on
[5:26:53] Galdrena: they are on a server called Bloodsail Buccaners with an addon called Hardcore @TrioDeFo
[5:27:04] Galdrena: i don't know what the server named for EU is
[5:27:09] Galdrena: name*
[5:27:27] eltonazevedobounty: @Swifty  you need to charge colosusm smash then thunderclap to put rend on them then bladestorm then WW sweeping strikes 1overpower 1 cleave 1 overpower 1 cleave
[5:27:28] Lordmonkus: good god arms looks good
[5:27:39] killvaine05: the EU server is hydraxian waterlords i believe
[5:27:42] eltonazevedobounty: but it changes after u have 4 tier pieces
[5:27:50] jxakari: @Swifty aslong as youre spamming aoe abilities with 2 or more enemies youll pull high dps
[5:28:13] eltonazevedobounty: u need to priotize the mortal strike instead cleave

[5:28:58] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store

[11:50:36] BloodSick_PT: bombs went off
[11:51:13] Anonyme117QC: I am confused ? is he raiding for a specific item that would help him in pvp ?
[11:51:27] UncleOnion88: The omni token

[11:52:15] The_Sanctified: wow
[11:52:16] Anonyme117QC: no its 1 EVER
[11:52:16] Teagens: So I'm thinking about changing the name of my Discord. I'm doing some rebranding and honestly, I'm liking the sound of The Jolly Dragon, a tavern themed Discord.
[11:52:21] Anonyme117QC: its a one time deal
[11:52:26] UncleOnion88: @Swifty Do you know what add on you use that changes your dragon riding ui?
[11:52:28] Talason: want me to come in swif
[11:52:32] LegendNumbaOne: Still a chance to get it on last boss drop

[11:52:55] Pallyofhell: swifty!
[11:52:55] Talason: SWIFTY
[11:52:58] Talason: they pulled

[11:53:22] LegendNumbaOne: @Cybernytez Not free free no, but there is a chance for last boss to drop omnitoken anyway
[11:53:25] Talason: teagens trolling
[11:53:32] EliBourne: nice countdown
[11:53:38] BloodSick_PT: WutFace
[11:53:51] Anonyme117QC: swifty would you ever consider getting a full pve set and pumping some keys and raid ? would be nice to see you in action :P
[11:54:59] Anonyme117QC: true, you always figure out some cool stuff I wonder how well you could pump in arm :D
[11:55:49] jxakari: see i prefer mythic+ content, Higher keys are much harder then normal/heroic raiding and rewards are far frequent
[11:56:05] TactileCurve: what a time for your headset to start dying
[11:56:07] Anonyme117QC: True
[11:56:42] Anonyme117QC: out of clearing the raid twice in both diffiiculty  heroic/normal I received 1 piece of loot
[11:56:52] Anonyme117QC: that is 32 boss for 1 loot
[11:57:21] Pallyofhell: thats because some silly dev thought bringing group loot back for heroic and normal was a good idea
[11:57:39] Anonyme117QC: yep I hate it
[11:58:05] Teagens: Oh. Oh wow. That explains why Sarkareth sounded so familiar. He's voiced by Taliesin Jaffe from Critical Role
[11:58:07] Anonyme117QC: and then you always have the low gears peep in raid needing on everything even if its not a bis for them. its depressing

[12:02:38] Talason: swift you doing heroic raid after this?
[12:02:46] Talason: for the HORDE
[12:04:59] Pallyofhell: locks are only useful to summon and give cookies
[12:05:30] Talason: locks are the highest dps atm
[12:05:32] Spart4nm4n: lol found another funny clip. https://youtu.be/VAVLOHbqWd4?t=92 @Swifty
[12:05:34] coinbearer: Swifttyyyyy, how you liking the newest patch so far?
[12:06:13] Talason: they are giving healers bonus honor soon
[12:06:28] Talason: bonus conquest maybe
[12:06:31] coinbearer: talkin about the rated solo mode?
[12:06:55] MikeSpoonz: The struggle is real in solo
[12:06:58] coinbearer: ahhh gotcha, well thats a bummer.
[12:07:08] MikeSpoonz: Sometimes I help some folks out when I see them make mistake
[12:07:12] Cybernytez: problem is also the dampening ramps up mega fast in shuffle so healers do nothing really after 1 min
[12:07:12] twintorbo9: i literally started doing m+ instead of solo q cuz of the que man
[12:07:16] jxakari: so solo shuffle is just healers quing?
[12:07:26] twintorbo9: got 2400 on my lock but the ques are like 1hr
[12:07:31] therapy4pain: Solo shuffle: 1v1 2v2, 3v3 w healer
[12:07:37] twintorbo9: m+ is so much more fun rn xD
[12:07:40] argorlant2: Is the queue up for that group?
[12:07:55] MikeSpoonz: That would be fun
[12:08:09] Talason: look at all the feasts?

[12:26:40] aboozed: Still here swiftly lol
[12:26:40] EvoCyberNation: The distance to cover due to mechanics is insane. I think they made the AoE abilities of the boss too separate. You're literally running from one side of the platform to the other.
[12:26:40] Gamingkillerbot: thier is i think
[12:27:22] Gamingkillerbot: im still shock 2016 i followed
[12:27:27] drummiez: harder than Ulduar?

[12:32:03] Rockstaaar80: :)
[12:32:20] Pallyofhell: Kappa is the best way to express sarcasm in chat

[12:33:03] Rockstaaar80: I'll be better next time, promise
[12:33:03] GenXGamerDad: how many pulls so far?
[12:33:18] Pallyofhell: idk how many pulls
[12:33:37] noxxysucks: why are they struggeling ? never done this raid
[12:34:07] AllenzoTV: how many pulls? a lot
[12:34:10] Vanguarded: Are you excited for Blizzon @Swifty
[12:34:19] AllenzoTV: atleast like 12
[12:34:27] Pallyofhell: just a lot of dmg going through out the fight @noxxysucks
[12:34:41] noxxysucks: okay okay
[12:35:32] Pallyofhell: this raid is pretty well tuned
[12:35:36] noxxysucks: it's been a while since i saw swifty so focused LUL
[12:36:06] BloodSick_PT: world first swifty lets gooo
[12:36:20] noxxysucks: If only Fury warrior had grievious wounds

[12:38:39] AllenzoTV: is prediction over? maybe start another one cause they lost there
[12:38:49] Tengal: Isnt time for Swifty duel vanilla videos ?
[12:38:56] The_Sanctified: multiple mechanics
[12:38:59] StreamElements: Viewers and Subscribers generate points! You can redeem them at store for on screen effects! https://streamelements.com/swifty/store
[12:39:19] Pallyofhell: the boss isnt that hard
[12:39:20] AllenzoTV: give ppl more time to vote , maybe more ppl will get in on it
[12:39:33] Rockstaaar80: hard is good as it seems to be tuned properly at least.
[12:39:55] The_Sanctified: sometimes the timers of the mechanics will land on the same time if dps isn't fast enough
[12:39:59] Pallyofhell: its pretty well tuned by the mechanics arent hard to understand
[12:40:02] The_Sanctified: things can get pretty nasty
[12:40:16] wagyu_88: THIS IS NORMAL????

[12:40:46] Teagens: *slooooow sip* Also helps when you have a tank who knows their mechanics
[12:40:48] Rockstaaar80: This isn't so hard as it seems more learn the mechanics that people are dying to.
[12:40:50] Teagens: Just sayin
[12:40:58] wagyu_88: i thought this was heroic
[12:41:07] Pallyofhell: normal seems hard because ppl think they should steamroll it while being under the ilvl of the raid LUL
[12:41:09] JattixTV: @Teagens lmao
[12:41:22] Rockstaaar80: @Teagens that helps
[12:41:44] Intrus18: Swifty what screen do you have again? LG 45" OLED?
[12:41:44] doodshteve: i just got this cleared on n last night n it got easier as ppl left its so exponentially hard with more ppl i dont get it
[12:42:16] Pallyofhell: more ppl = more chances of someone messing up
[12:42:29] Rockstaaar80: whats this raid size? 19 or 20?
[12:42:44] LazyPaladin2: I woke up after 8 hours sleep, and Swifty still online xD dedication
