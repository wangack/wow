[1:23:30] btbamfan3: @shroud that p server you were talking about doesnt have dungeon caps when leveling
[1:23:48] qbabattoir: I would be ok if they increased drop rate of loot
[1:23:52] omnibrooks: unlock dungeon spamming but keep a max lvl limit
[1:23:57] Pr1m0x21: @btbamfan3 turtle wow?
[1:23:58] MimikzTV: everyone would level in dungeons instead of questing

[1:24:09] Alisonder: Can you do dungeons with 5 players? Or only your duo?
[1:24:25] puwkakukuwka: track pls
[1:24:27] DuncXD: @Alisonder with 5 players that are HC players aswell
[1:24:28] CBear0414: @omnibrooks Ye this is what I was talking to my brother about. Dont have a run limit, but make WC like, 16-22 only. So its risky but you can still try to get your items

[1:27:29] 7Berzerk: thats kind of true. Would be something new
[1:27:32] cryptori: same tbh Im not sure they would but a very small chance they could since thats their new motto with retail
[1:27:33] jiggyspice: Agreed
[1:27:41] SPACESHIP88: I agree!
[1:27:45] DuncXD: It would make it a lot easier to find high level dungeons which is nice

[1:28:08] DPTDave: balance wouldn't even matter if theyt did that then right?
[1:28:14] hi_im_clipzy: Do you feel mousepads make a lot of diff in fps games? If so any you recommend
[1:28:17] Masteve: @shroud As pvp is not a thing on hardcore it would make sense for cross faction stuff IMO
[1:28:29] btbamfan3: what do you expect? its blizz
[1:28:32] Waytoowhat: true
[1:28:39] DuncXD: Atleast the acknowledged it
[1:28:41] aSeaBacon: Literally the only thing we learned was there will be duel to the death
[1:28:50] aSeaBacon: everything else we already knew
[1:29:03] sylarlich: can you revive on HC?
[1:29:14] Masteve: lol
[1:29:15] DuncXD: @sylarlich yes but you're no longer considered HC
[1:29:17] coneheadnor: no bgs either @shroud ?
[1:29:18] Bobb_EH: i thought the whole thing was a jebait so the fact they said anything shocked me lol
[1:29:30] Alisonder: Even if your class has a self rez?
[1:29:39] hi_im_clipzy: Do you feel mousepads make a lot of diff in fps games? If so any you recommend
[1:29:40] DuncXD: @Alisonder correct
[1:29:52] Taz7558: agreed
[1:29:56] verm518: bg's would be cool
[1:29:58] qbabattoir: yea
[1:30:02] Lumbdan: @sylarlich perma death bro hench the hardcore lol
[1:30:05] jiggyspice: Yeah BG's with no death=delete would be awesome
[1:30:08] st1tchd: HC can use BGs right now but we can't equip honor gear
[1:30:08] Ayjayyy: a bg would be a literal deathmatch lol that would be interesting to watch
[1:30:10] Brevitas: people would spam for gear though
[1:30:10] jiggyspice: no idea why they restrict BG's
[1:30:11] coneheadnor: yeah def
[1:30:12] taylorsdank: taking away respawning is taking away a core part of the game
[1:30:13] EyyRa: ranking gear would be madatory
[1:30:14] sylarlich: lame, healers revive useless
[1:30:15] CBear0414: You will most likely be able to BG, @shroud BG's didnt get rid of Soul of Iron in SoM, so I doubt it would kill you on hardcore server
[1:30:23] Taz7558: I see no downside into letting people do bgs still
[1:30:25] Fadamaka: yeah but do you die if die in BG?
[1:30:31] DuncXD: @Fadamaka yes
[1:30:32] 18B_ACTUAL: Some group did it, the whole team deleted their toons
[1:30:32] sikwidit808: @hi_im_clipzy artisan mousepads suppose to be the best right now I use qck xxxl great for price if you got money go artisan
[1:30:32] coneheadnor: miss my highwarlord rogue
[1:30:34] qbabattoir: no factions in bgs either
[1:30:34] btbamfan3: who really cares about classic pvp anyways shits broken
[1:30:37] st1tchd: @Fadamaka rules say it's okay to die in BG, just cant use the gear
[1:30:39] SykesHK: bgs to blow off steam
[1:30:45] Icedoq: yea gotta get that 10% mount discount
[1:30:47] freddiebeast: yeah but if they get rank 14 gear after months and die, laughs on them
[1:30:50] Gridlock777: @taylurok I think a nice compromise would be no spirit release.
[1:30:51] turtle543: abi tr hali ne olacak
[1:30:52] StarlightNebula_: The point of hc is to get you out in the dangerous and immersive world. People would just spam BGs and remove the entire point of the challenge.
[1:31:09] qbabattoir: Kreygasm o ya
[1:31:10] SykesHK: yeah exactly aha
[1:31:11] grac3dguru: BG but perma death still applies XD
[1:31:18] SPACESHIP88: I think everyone will end up using the HC addon on the HC official server
[1:31:20] Masteve: I just wana explode some peoples.
[1:31:24] CBear0414: @StarlightNebula_ BG's dont give experience in vanilla?
[1:31:26] coneheadnor: why highwarlord was a though grind tho
[1:31:26] st1tchd: @StarlightNebula_ Then they get 10 levels higher and can't do shit because their gear didn't keep up
[1:31:27] funthebear: are they gonna release official HC server?
[1:31:38] IpToothless: Hard times rooPog
[1:31:42] IpToothless: catJAM

[1:38:52] DuncXD: i did it at 34 and felt fine
[1:38:52] 7Berzerk: 29 probably
[1:38:59] king_tedward: I hate when people say Jaina and Alexstrasza are hotter than Chromie. Will Jaina or Alexstrasza stay with you after you're finished with them? No. Can you fit them in your pocket and use them whenever you want? No. Would they make out with you in public? No, lol, didn't think so.
[1:39:02] EC_Zold: 31 for hardcore
[1:39:04] SPACESHIP88: RFK is like 32 right?
[1:39:05] Mountainman47: maybe im wrong lol
[1:39:06] Ghostring: Chat can you do this IRL PotFriend
[1:39:08] leftyschreff: 31 was cozy

[1:39:38] itszethwish: Hey Shroud sunfToad
[1:39:46] Johnny2Gats: 33% chance for it to drop
[1:39:54] leftyschreff: Its so rewarding if you get it though
[1:39:59] obs1d1an1: !mouse
[1:40:00] Fossabot: @obs1d1an1 He's using the Logitech G303 Shroud Edition Wireless- With a Logitech G840 XL Gaming Mousepad shroud Edition - His mouse and mousepad are back in stock! Get it while you still can!
[1:40:03] Monumension: its good for multiple characters keeps the dungeons fresh
[1:40:17] Conflikto: I miss the old pubg domination days but this is pretty cool too
[1:40:21] qbabattoir: Yea
[1:40:23] kikibro: They have to make multiple runs for a dungeon it will make it so much better. Still a limit but not for sure not 1 per character
[1:40:29] dingo_dongo38: I did RFK lastnight on my Warr, and the Helm dropped instead of Corpesmaker. but I forgot to ask the group to clear left side so I could kill the mob for my Warrior quest so gg
[1:40:29] whyvaltertaken: shroud quit val?
[1:40:30] DuncXD: At the same time if yoiu spam a dungeon and get BiS gear you'll be able to cruise for like 5+ levels
[1:40:36] Exkane_: whats doing right now is working
[1:40:45] Damomentt: the creators of hc are pretty into immersion maybe that was a part of it but i can see why some do not likek it
[1:40:50] seukas: yeah thats true
[1:40:51] cryptori: real and true take
[1:40:52] yaldzz: when is hardcore?
[1:40:56] notafemboysituation: boosting version POG hc af
[1:40:58] tomgrel: perfect hardcore
[1:40:59] kikibro: I don't want the ability to spam a dungeon but 2 or 3 chances to get a big piece of loot sounds good to me
[1:41:01] itz_ezioo: sen win first map
[1:41:08] thotcoco: or like a daily lockout
[1:41:12] tomgrel: perfect hardcore is normal but no deaths
[1:41:15] tomgrel: thats it
[1:41:19] Boosticuff: people like the difficulty of ssf and dungeon limits but it's tough to put those rules on everyone and expect them to like it
[1:41:28] MartyOneMansParty: I think the perfect hardcore is if blizzard makes many options at character creation to tailor it to the persons needs
[1:41:29] grayfoxzz: Sadge
[1:41:30] Xtaro: I think perfect hardcore should mean full penetration
[1:41:33] LennyTheOldMan: 1 Houer cooldown dugeon when u lev up
[1:41:34] ShinyHunterSin: only thing they need to change is being able to do dungeons at 100 percent nerfed xp after first run and allow grouping for elit quests
[1:41:42] JalaTheGreat: @shroud do you think 3 of the same dungeon max a week would be a good middle ground for HC?
[1:41:44] exestic: song ????
[1:41:50] 01653347213: shroudDab
[1:42:07] qbabattoir: will blizzard deliver Hmm
[1:42:08] AimRobot: hardcore on bosses that mark you for death and you cant avoid :P
[1:42:10] Ferpectpanda: would just turn in to people dying at it's peak in raids
[1:42:11] SoullessNAY: difference is they have community insight, because hardcore has been going on a while
[1:42:22] notafemboysituation: not going to be classic plus that's for sure
[1:42:26] dingo_dongo38: Steelsnap?
[1:42:26] Conflikto: So this isn‚Äôt official?
[1:42:27] maximilian_gg: many people will just still use the addon, which is fine. and: way less griefing because the griefers will die die as well. looking forward to it.
[1:42:27] ZgRDaglu: yine baharlar gelecek
[1:42:30] sebroxer: HC raids coming too ?
[1:42:32] TentacleMeat: watching wow on twitch vs resubbing wow
[1:42:41] DuncXD: Can we get a gear check?
[1:42:44] Maniac___Gaming: Asmon thinks dungeons should be able to be spammed but at a 90% reduced xp gain to offset boosting through the levels
[1:43:00] pagaspastft: Sen win
[1:43:06] TentacleMeat: !server
[1:43:06] Fossabot: @TentacleMeat, The DayZ server has been taken offline while Grey Man 2.0 is being worked on in the background. Keep an eye out for more!
[1:43:12] neugassh: gear means way more if you cant spam dungeons
[1:43:14] TentacleMeat: !wow
[1:43:21] ScotchyBoy: I like that idea
[1:43:21] cryptori: thats a very interesting idea i like the thought of that
[1:43:24] Boosticuff: Less xp after first run sounds interesting
[1:43:25] Noraii: 90% reduce xp on mobs but 300% increased xp for quest reward
[1:43:25] kikibro: That is actually a great idea
[1:43:33] alakazam__man: Asmon plays this game too much lol
[1:43:37] tomgrel: could just reduce xp each time you do it
[1:43:40] Lumbdan: lol thats not that genius just makes sense haha, plenty of games implement that
[1:43:41] Bazzzel: thats great
[1:43:45] MartyOneMansParty: @Maniac___Gaming Cant they just have different hardcore settings? Why do all hardcore character have to abide by the same rules?
[1:43:47] bluff1n: that would be sweet
[1:43:52] ShawnMarv: he although said to boost quest exp by 300% so everyone want to do atleast every dungeon one time
[1:43:57] kurgerbingx: Cudiiiii
[1:43:57] DenWallace: lol
[1:43:58] Bazzzel: true sadly
[1:43:59] Lerbrekk: what about healers?
[1:44:01] Pawnsauce: LUL
[1:44:05] nox_Co: makes too much sense for blizzard to do it
[1:44:11] Bakar_khan: Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches Peaches
[1:44:15] DenWallace: shroud blizzard are not capable of doing anything very smart
[1:44:21] maximilian_gg: yeah he's a smart guy.
[1:44:22] morattusingle7: is this game free to play?
[1:44:23] qbabattoir: Yep
[1:44:25] kaschk18: GIGACHAD
[1:44:26] sawjet: He says the same thing about you
[1:44:27] ManaDeIRey: Lmao
[1:44:28] imozrabbit: Then they will have a dungeon exp boost in store
[1:44:29] SoullessNAY: we love asmon
[1:44:31] earskin57: Your dieing dude
[1:44:33] mattgtr22: H you ooo
[1:44:35] earskin57: Shoot
[1:44:39] rimonabant: Or you remove xp gains from all dungeon mobs and then buff the quest reward to be equal to a full clear xp wise
[1:44:46] 7Berzerk: I'd want u to play it tbh
[1:44:47] XFXMorpheus: confirmed
[1:44:49] JalaTheGreat: @morattusingle7 nope you pay a subscription to it every month, 3 months, 6 or a year
[1:44:52] leftyschreff: Hes a gamer
[1:44:54] XFXMorpheus: early access pog
[1:44:59] earskin57: And your bold
[1:45:04] neugassh: he has 2k hours in new world he has pretty shitty eyes
[1:45:07] qbabattoir: He‚Äôs gonna be honest
[1:45:26] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[1:45:29] Bazzzel: but asmon is a real gamer and thats not the metric they care about
[1:45:34] maximilian_gg: i just hope people still care about HC by the time blizzards version comes out. i will play then.
[1:45:36] Kalashnikorv: doodle can see on his map where they spawn, they only spawn on two spots.
[1:45:41] Corvln: no its not
[1:45:56] Laufst: @shroud is new world worth getting into as a new player?
[1:45:57] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[1:46:18] straightupmotorcycles: new world battle pass is a annoying grind
[1:46:21] neugassh: nw is absolute trash
[1:46:31] straightupmotorcycles: feeels like a chore
[1:46:31] dyslexsix: steelsnap?
[1:46:36] JalaTheGreat: @shroud watch once you abandon the quest he pops up
[1:46:45] noobmaster4587: Hey shroud. When is your next premiere valorant match??
[1:46:45] Juggy__: 5 bars in 40mins
[1:46:46] DeleteThisAccountAlready: ‚Ä¶
[1:46:54] Exkane_: sumPls
[1:46:57] nerve_93: Is this game fun and what do you achieve?
[1:46:59] Perseco: i would trust Asmon's game feedback, but not his food feedback... dude cooks his steaks well done regardless of the cut  lol
[1:47:00] SageMeisterr: i hope blizzard can make wow f2p experience better, they are missing out on a lot of ppl
[1:47:16] StarlightNebula_: What are they looking for, steelsnap?
[1:47:19] dlcmbrunnimate: thats ll they are going to do
[1:47:32] Maniac___Gaming: Maybe increase difficulty of a dungeon x the amount of times you complete it? So spamming it would put your group at a higher risk of failing. Would keep most people at doing it a couple vs doing nothing BUT dungeons?
[1:47:35] becauzzzz: wanna cream my ass?
[1:47:41] mrkonrad89: 6 years later
[1:47:41] Tobiiask: @becauzzzz yes
[1:47:52] noobmaster4587: Hey shroud. When is your next premiere valorant match??
[1:47:53] btbamfan3: meant for u to grind exp

[1:48:16] meepothecat: Sorry guys, is this Classic or Normal WoW?
[1:48:18] becauzzzz: SHREEEEEEEEEEEWDDDDDDDDDDDD
[1:48:23] Kalashnikorv: @dyslexsix they are not
[1:48:25] neugassh: with trading its way less risky...you just keep your stuff on an alt character
[1:48:31] noobmaster4587: Hey shroud. When is your next premiere valorant match??
[1:48:57] DenWallace: trading is fucking dumb
[1:49:02] organicktubejuice: Shroud what class are you mailing for D4?
[1:49:07] organicktubejuice: Maining
[1:49:16] lomgonecold: AH be nice  :p
[1:49:18] EroX455: offical hc when?
[1:49:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Blizzard isn't going to ban bubble-hearthing
[1:49:28] BobbyCarez: what they should do is make it so you cant trade anything. But make it so you can learn all proffessions
[1:49:28] SykesHK: yeah agreed
[1:49:29] dlcmbrunnimate: there will be trading the AH and multiple dungeon runs
[1:49:36] becauzzzz: !premier
[1:49:36] Fox56: self found just makes a lot more sense for hardcore
[1:49:37] tobigtomove: Trading will bring bots and gold farmers.
[1:49:39] Cvoken: @shroud i bet ppl will just stick to the addon anyway
[1:49:43] Yasi1337: I saw someone who nearly died as the loot master could you imagine how pissed people would be LUL @shroud
[1:49:49] noobmaster4587: Hey shroud. When is your next premiere valorant match??
[1:49:55] neugassh: and you can just send all the best gear to your alt
[1:50:02] Rypu: ppl dont care about 60, they care about journey to 60
[1:50:34] noobmaster4587: Hey shroud. When is your next premiere valorant match??
[1:50:49] vinexryan: @Rypu Wrong game dude
[1:50:49] becauzzzz: Christian Ronald
[1:50:53] ScenicC_: RIP Kunfe
[1:50:54] thotcoco: rough wa yto go
[1:50:58] SeanDidSomething: I care about being lvl 60, screw the journey
[1:50:59] DeleteThisAccountAlready: Lmao
[1:50:59] ScenicC_: He got too comfy
[1:51:02] Tom__404: how different is classic lvling vs retail (not HC)
[1:51:04] qbabattoir: ppl def care about HC raiding at 60
[1:51:09] q8Perilous: U will play season2 ? The new raid
[1:51:11] 7Berzerk: if you die to an elevator.. you probably shouldnt play HC
[1:51:12] mrkonrad89: elevator bugg wasent that a thing before?
[1:51:14] Alvendo: @Rypu What journey? 3 mages warri and healer spamming dungeons? mage grind on hyper spot? kekw
[1:51:21] becauzzzz: my precum smells like pousey
[1:51:22] bael_ttv: how do you have motivation to play hc with official servers coming in like a month now?
[1:51:24] neugassh: the 0.1% will raid in hc
[1:51:26] DuncXD: I died with my trio to the undercity elevator at level 29, my friends were pissed.
[1:51:36] Skubo11: i like journey
[1:51:37] ScenicC_: I think the journey is cool but im in it for the endgame for sure
[1:51:46] becauzzzz: roblox 4k
[1:51:48] whatsupkg: journey
[1:51:51] SageMeisterr: imagine wasting your time, just to die in a raid and reset it all
[1:51:53] StarlightNebula_: @TomasPog Veeeery different. Leveling is like 90% of the game in classic, in retails it's like a rush to endgame.
[1:52:02] bchamp93: if only end game content was hard in classic lol
[1:52:06] qbabattoir: catJAM
[1:52:06] taywright23: !addons
[1:52:06] Fossabot: @taywright23 Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[1:52:08] Adollo: !add on
[1:52:11] MatiXxaru: The journey weed's out the player's which I like for endgame.
[1:52:13] qbabattoir: holy jammer
[1:52:17] Tom__404: @TomasPog makes sense, i felt like lvling in retail was really easy, is it harder in classic?
[1:52:24] Perseco: i imagine emotions would run higher with raiding deaths in hc
[1:52:42] ScenicC_: @Perseco Yeah theres some drama in HC elite for sure
[1:52:57] AdsAreBadz: @Perseco  gloriThink
[1:53:02] kikibro: Anyone got a good guestimate on the release date of official servers? I dont wanna level now if its in a month
[1:53:12] ScenicC_: @Perseco I think 2 people recently committed suicide because one of their friends died in a raid and the guild was upset because those 2 took resources
[1:53:19] neugassh: @kikibro august
[1:53:32] qbabattoir: @kikibro get those practice runs in GIGACHAD
[1:53:52] TheBextest: HC looks so fun but ive never played classic wow before :(
[1:54:07] batmern_: probably end of summer
[1:54:08] kobywanna: he don't give a flyin puck
[1:54:08] Exeend: sadge u closed thegrey man servers:(
[1:54:09] ScenicC_: My guess is like august for HC
[1:54:09] meepothecat: is this classic WoW or Retail?
[1:54:12] Yozki: try 1.5 years lol
[1:54:15] llokitotumoko: true
[1:54:16] akers95: said end of summer
[1:54:17] BlastedNips: @TheBextest Don't do it. You'll just die over and over.
[1:54:20] Musclebus: they love fall releases
[1:54:22] Odezq: @kikibro understand you, i have same feeling its like time waste atm. only to practise but not worth the time tbh
[1:54:24] mrkonrad89: Blizzard makes misstakes
[1:54:24] jerckysminion: most likely september
[1:54:27] Authori: trying to speed run leveling in wow classic is so much more fun than speed running other games imo, cant stand trying to speed run POE ACTS 1-10
[1:54:28] ThatIsSoCrazy: september 5th at 3 pm est
[1:54:33] Yasi1337: Blizzard do make mistakes tho LUL
[1:54:35] Odezq: @kikibro coz these servers will be dead af soon
[1:54:37] ScenicC_: My birthday is august 23 and that would be a very Pog birthday present
[1:54:37] becauzzzz: !mic
[1:54:37] Fossabot: @becauzzzz Mike uses the Blue Mouse microphone amzn.com/dp/B000RLF7KA

[1:54:41] neugassh: they said summer
[1:54:44] barbxxl: info for official hc ?

[2:19:33] StarlightNebula_: @asj1410 You can appeal your deaths to bugs or random stuff like that
[2:19:37] ThemisMike: are you having fun?
[2:19:43] 7Berzerk: I died twice from DC and thats why I stopped playing.
[2:19:44] ZomBearzTTV: Diablow
[2:19:45] Levinbane: Hard-core in mmorpgs like this in this scale is also a little unheard of.
[2:19:46] lourenco321: @shroud how does a teen get into wow given the membership cost?
[2:19:46] DenWallace: bean is just dumb
[2:19:46] HarryBlopper: appeals are kinda rare tho arent they? @shroud
[2:19:50] v2Occy: dead is deaD, GOOD
[2:19:56] DenWallace: it's painful to listen to someone so dumb talk
[2:19:57] lourenco321: How does a teen get into wow given the membership cost? @shroud
[2:20:00] osirion1: it will kill it for most people
[2:20:01] Levinbane: It's pretty cool
[2:20:03] jasonabchooper: @shroud why not just make your chracter drop 10 levels per death?
[2:20:05] wassaah: or you contact blizzard and get an anwers in 30 days, its fine
[2:20:05] racketpunch: Appealing death is why this version of HC blows.  Ain‚Äôt none of that in Diablo
[2:20:09] reverseplatypus: will people still use the addon on official?
[2:20:11] SpYdota2: how many charcaters did you lose ?
[2:20:12] StarlightNebula_: Yeah there is no way official HC is gonna be remotely close to the community-driven one
[2:20:15] itsLeanza: what are you eating
[2:20:15] v2Occy: You dont get appeals for Diablo ir any other ARPG youve also spen 100+ hours on
[2:20:15] DeputyMJ: sadly how osrs hardcore works too. if you dc you are sol

[2:20:29] HarryBlopper: D:
[2:20:30] depressdmonke: @lourenco321 don't get into wow and socialize, you'll be thankful in the long run lol

[2:20:34] ZarnZeal: Appeals are garbo, agreed
[2:20:35] CoboTheGreat: lol yea
[2:20:39] racketpunch: Who cares how long it takes?  Wtf
[2:20:40] coneheadnor: @jipsplade only 1 hc server I think
[2:20:41] mrkonrad89: years of playtime
[2:20:42] swagcon: what are you eating
[2:20:45] AwFeel: @shroud what if the trade off for no appeals was 20% increased exp from quests only
[2:20:47] DeluxiZ: but with official hc it could make alot more impact if you reach 60 and get on a leaderboard etc.
[2:20:48] bbaaiilleeyy1: diablo is like 100x wow rates
[2:20:49] 1chillpill: ?????
[2:20:51] Muramasa_911: not diablo 2
[2:20:51] sunlitebro: TRUE
[2:20:53] HarryBlopper: @v2Occy this is at least 150+ hours to reach 60
[2:20:54] 64BitGunslinger: But the Apple is not an Orange!
[2:20:54] brryye101: why cant people justunderstand wow is fun yet this makes it more fun
[2:20:58] christian_0p: DC's are part of games tbh, part of the risk
[2:20:58] lourenco321: @shroud Is there any way to play the game without the membership?
[2:20:59] grimswell: If Blizz doesnt add some QoL and make professions and some other stuff soloable, then they shouldnt even bother imo. The community add on is probably better in that case
[2:21:01] NoApologies: are you serious? LUL
[2:21:01] StarlightNebula_: People hate using their brains before speaking LULW
[2:21:04] ZarnZeal: You lose gear in diablo too...

[2:21:45] HarryBlopper: @v2Occy bro some players in wow has 1000+ days /played on some of their characters
[2:21:46] itszethwish: Is Diablo the best console RPG?
[2:21:46] dzendastark: How do you know there is no appeal system
[2:21:46] coneheadnor: maybe full server porblems?
[2:21:46] Tamaroc: there shouldnt be one
[2:21:47] Levinbane: Diablo hard-core is more about losing gear, not levels
[2:21:51] T0mmle: how about accept your fait
[2:21:55] racketpunch: You continue Diablo and gear up in HC. You don‚Äôt stop at max level.
[2:22:01] v2Occy: @HarryBlopper Because they keep appealing stupid shit lol
[2:22:01] jasonabchooper: @shroud can you use token  to level to 60 like expansion?
[2:22:03] saosin0: i got dc'ed today twice underwater with mob on face thank god for ssd
[2:22:05] asj1410: What about if you die in bg?

[2:22:15] tabrexs: MmmHmm
[2:22:22] straightupmotorcycles: he has a min,
[2:22:22] StarlightNebula_: @racketpunch You literally don't in wow either? People do HC raids.

[4:11:37] sifer007: Everquest was even slower than wow

[4:13:50] craftyonyou: thoughts on New Worlds future?
[4:13:51] Kwaakku: is there hardcore pvp servers?
[4:13:51] sagecity__: adding a cross-wow (or even cross-game) achievments/rewards for achieving for example lvl 60 in HC wow, would boost HC popularity even more
[4:13:52] wassaah: the even said in the announcement that they still want the rules and everything to be community
[4:13:55] Oztington: when the sun sets down its pretty
[4:13:57] JJJnray1: rather vast and empty than no room to move and explore
[4:13:59] wassaah: so addon will 100% stay

[4:54:32] Misterbaits: alliance zones are tighter
[4:54:32] novak_back: rogues are very gear dependent
[4:54:32] mavus: maybe horde because of less competition
[4:54:33] zuboco: Gnome mage for sure
[4:54:37] deadvesu: Horde cause of Barrens
[4:54:37] dankoliciouz: Horde rogue cause of passive heal for troll

[4:54:53] neugassh: female dwarf rogue for sure
[4:54:54] Tactics_lol: I think alliance is slightly faster, but very even. Gnome mage is the fastest in general
[4:54:54] mandurilxl: fastest
[4:54:56] qbabattoir: skill > gear
[4:54:58] htcyofi: Guys fighting is only 33% of leveling. What levels fast is shortening travel distances making hunter the #1 solo class to 60. 2nd is Druid then Rogue.

[5:05:09] uberr1: are you playing more CS 2 when it is officially releasing?
[5:05:14] zuboco: @Zomgpanties aoe stun is even better
[5:05:24] TheWindfish7: the issue is advertising nfts in a game means 2 things, the game itself is garbage and nfts are a scam in their current implementations
[5:05:31] Pr1m0x21: Exited for turtlewow ?
[5:05:37] elhijolamatii: ey @shroud do you have any type of list for addons?
[5:05:50] Visionate: Do you get a flaming tounge,with flametounge totem?
[5:05:55] Express_v1: @shroud how did you come up with ur char name?
[5:06:01] novak_back: AI NPCs
[5:06:03] TheWindfish7: ai has been a buzzword for years
[5:06:06] novak_back: the hardest part with AI is quality control
[5:06:09] BlastedNips: I just want an AI shroud to talk shit to me every time I'm making a bad decision.
[5:06:15] Tactics_lol: Imagine how big an MMO could be with AI
[5:06:18] pollygram666: Your god damn right its fair
[5:06:19] uberr1: Humans never utilize correctly :D
[5:06:21] Protomateria: AI is going to change the world
[5:06:21] Smoogol: the voiceover addon is proof of its potential
[5:06:27] Shadowxzxzx: people who hate ai r dumb
[5:06:29] at1c: AI has practical usability
[5:06:30] Blynx: AI in RPGs could be insane.
[5:06:30] TopSavy: we trying to replace our kind with AI KEKW
[5:06:30] pollygram666: Make more machines
[5:06:30] BPK3: I feel like it was a buzz world but is now becoming more
[5:06:32] uberr1: or the guys who are reigning over us at least
[5:06:35] novak_back: the most immediate thing youll see from AI is AI voice generated speach which is already impressive.
[5:06:42] yuhhcky: AI is only big atm to those outside of tech business..
[5:06:42] Express_v1: @shroud how did you come up with ur char name?
[5:06:46] imozrabbit: make ai into our heads then no need to worry
[5:06:52] TimurDEforce: I never played this game what do you guys should i try it or nope?
[5:07:00] novak_back: personally the AI voice addon for wow while scuff is pretty huge quality of life improvement, the classic wow quest are great
[5:07:02] VassagoTheGrey: @BugAndAhalf nope
[5:07:04] grimswell: Well all jsut walk in to the living room and ask Alexa to generate us a movie or game that no other human will ever see/play
[5:07:08] Smoogol: @XD_Crooks so 99.9% of people
[5:07:11] 4kuji: AI is a tool that has to be used by someone who knows how to use it. as any other tool but if used correctly it advances developent rapidly.i strongly believe that AI soon will be a big part of every game. Because with AI games will half development time.
[5:07:13] uberr1: shroudy are you playing more CS 2 again when its officially releasing?
[5:07:16] TimurDEforce: @VassagoTheGrey sorry to ask but WhY?
[5:07:31] VassagoTheGrey: @BugAndAhalf cause youll end up like my wife playing it for 15~ yrs
[5:07:32] pollygram666: A I will be our bitch
[5:07:33] rato_de_esgoto88: Jobs go from repetitive tasks anyone can do to being qualified non repetitive jobs that take years for populations to train and adapt. At some point all repetitive tasks will go away, and cant expect the 40+ guy to be competitive in the market.
[5:07:33] zuboco: @BugAndAhalf WoW is a great game but i aware u can even forget your real life ;)
[5:07:47] lnterSolar: Clueless
[5:07:47] TimurDEforce: @BugAndAhalf LMAO OK
[5:07:57] TheWindfish7: the issue with ai and automation always comes down to we don't have UBI for when a majority of the population is automated out of jobs
[5:07:57] Sudnim: yay more half assed games
[5:08:04] pollygram666: Ok I'm an idiot
[5:08:06] aralin_mandolin: AI is going to make everything even more generic ;(
[5:08:08] uberr1: ofc AI can do almost every script etc
[5:08:15] saeedbod88: WOW when are they gonna make it free shit
[5:08:15] Smoogol: bobby is ready for AI
[5:08:19] Boblhead: @hardhat86wwwww there already is XD
[5:08:20] LopesGame323: Salve
[5:08:25] Shadowxzxzx: getting closer to cyberpunk world Kreygasm
[5:08:27] VassagoTheGrey: @BugAndAhalf im only here for the drops incase i do wanna play one day with her lol
[5:08:27] yuhhcky: @smoogol AI is farther along then these streamers even speak of. Especially in the defense industry
[5:08:36] uberr1: i will fight against those AIs
[5:08:39] rato_de_esgoto88: @aralin_mandolin another shit take from someone who has never used art AI.
[5:08:45] sir_double_d: is this hardcore?
[5:08:45] Fezzzzzzzzzzz: What about that wow addon that makes all NPCs have VA
[5:08:47] Ph4seShift: Right now it will just make code that no one at the studio can understand or debug.  More buggy games.  We're at least 10 years from using AI for that
[5:08:49] Phalliphisius: oof
[5:08:51] pollygram666: Seen Terminator?
[5:08:55] fallb4me: wow
[5:08:58] GokayGecir: !sens

[5:09:05] dr_coomgoblin: What happen to grey man server
[5:09:05] TimurDEforce: I think AI is going to be the amazing anti cheat overwatch kind of thing man imagin...
[5:09:06] 4kuji: my point was not that every game will feel same because they all use it. my point was more that because its a tool not a one solution fix. it will be dependant on the person using ai for it to come out as a great product.
[5:09:07] dr_coomgoblin: ?!
[5:09:08] uberr1: @sir_double_d does this look hardcore to you

[5:09:16] dr_coomgoblin: ??!
[5:09:19] Protomateria: @Ph4seShift wdym? programmers are already using AI to make their jobs easier

[5:09:36] dr_coomgoblin: How come it‚Äôs down?
[5:09:42] mandurilxl: lol
[5:09:44] StarlightNebula_: @Ph4seShift That's only thinking in the avenue of chatgpt, but think of things like the AI voices addon in wow, AI character portraits generation, AI concept art generation etc

[5:10:29] ergoja: @Protomateria its useless for any complex programming problems because it's not trained on internal code. but soon companies should be training it on their own code.
[5:10:34] akdmkZTV: ele is bisss
[5:10:36] Wuuz1: manaproblems is worst
[5:11:00] Widehouse: Is duo faster than solo ?
[5:11:03] StarlightNebula_: @Ph4seShift You clearly are not a programmer lol You don't copy paste the code an ai helper vomits at you, you use it as a framework or base from which to build your own code
[5:11:04] sheferino: 40 ish no ?
[5:11:09] Protomateria: @sango3five yeah thats fair
[5:11:15] mastermindx421: im thinking resto
[5:11:16] imnotwestie: send it with CL
[5:11:16] VassagoTheGrey: does a polar bear shit in the zoo
[5:11:25] toomers_: fuck that
[5:11:27] novak_back: the really bottleneck with AI right now is hardware once we get that next cpu boost AI will take off. think semi conductor -> CPU -> quantum CPU i assume?
[5:11:28] OreyoGaming: @shroud will your game have controller support? and will rebind all controls?
[5:11:30] mastermindx421: keep warr up, its good. but doesnt beat warr priest lvling
[5:11:34] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[5:11:35] Widehouse: is duo leveling faster ?
[5:11:40] rato_de_esgoto88: @StarlightNebula_ for now buddy, but dont cope for too long find a diff job
[5:11:42] burnedfroggy: shroud you smell like milk
[5:11:48] akdmkZTV: idk about leveling but ele shams in classic pump at 60
[5:11:54] mandurilxl: having NR is nice but not else
[5:11:55] hate_xyz: Susge
[5:12:03] StarlightNebula_: Let's be clear on one thing: We're all sitting in twitch chat watching gameplay of like a 20 year old game, we know NOTHING about this topic KEKW
[5:12:05] Smoogol: Susge why no NFTs
[5:12:06] Ph4seShift: @Ph4seShift Incorrect on both counts.
[5:12:12] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[5:12:14] novak_back: the hardest/longest part of game development is figuring out what you're actually making

[5:12:21] okkenprawn: Susge sure
[5:12:22] OreyoGaming: ok ty
[5:12:22] lnterSolar: yea
[5:12:23] BillyTang: Would you like to voice act in the game @shroud
[5:12:25] novak_back: games are an art
[5:12:25] dewragtv: is shroud involved with the official hardcore ?
[5:12:32] mrcrspy: is this classic?
[5:12:36] way_back: Social Media has made people to close minded
[5:12:38] akdmkZTV: @11emsi ziqoG
[5:12:39] YakuzaArt_: Yes you say the game is nearly done and they think that means a weak from when you say it
[5:12:42] Phalliphisius: if u die in shroud's game u die in real life

[5:19:01] bigvig8: Feeling better today?
[5:19:05] StarlightNebula_: It depends on your goal. If you have a clear path/route you're taking, you just go again; otherwise take the time to learn before jumping in fresh.

[5:20:17] StarlightNebula_: @tiolexor HC is not rp, it means if they die they delete their characters; so the main point of the gameplay is to level in a dangerous world with only 1 life.

[6:26:19] bengalbroys: @dnosu its automated because you posted a link
[6:26:27] novak_back: the buff storage item was very positively received in classic wow and they scraped it for SOM
[6:26:28] sanyassan: it spawns a bunch

[6:27:01] ReubenSandwich: i thought they should replace world buffs with a repeatable turnin drop from neff and ony for a flask or elixer
[6:27:07] theGraye: make world buffs class specific
[6:27:09] Boblhead: @11emsi ya, but priv servers literally have like 100 v 100 an theres likes 0 lag XD

[6:27:47] harrisonford204: get rid of world buffs add heroism maybe?
[6:27:48] grimswell: I think the world buff is just another aspect of minmaxing that ppl would replace it with some other minmaxxy thing
[6:27:49] slaydx: World buffs give you something to do, once you're past MC in gearing, game kinda dies, World Buff PvP and then WB routes keep things to do in the game.

[7:16:04] novak_back: the thing about HC official is even if the hype dies down, as long as there is a core group of players the game will go on infinitely
[7:16:11] xxdockingdavexx: does the quest guide stop at 30?
[7:16:16] freshlovendrew: you guys are like twins

[7:18:06] erok01: whats max level for sfk?
[7:18:12] gil910: @novak1802 well, theres always griefing, plus in raids you can die to stuff out of your control, maybe not MC but AQ40 foir sure
[7:18:19] benionicash: !res
[7:18:19] Fossabot: @benionicash He plays at 2560 x 1440

[7:18:51] PandaATV: nothing is out of your control in those raids
[7:18:54] vision42g: atlas quest addon shows all quests for every dungeon

[7:20:01] Phnoey: damn
[7:20:04] gil910: @novak1802 now imagine a big part of players thinking the same, 70% never even making it to 60, servers dying and merging (as always), I'm very skeptical about this launch tbh
[7:20:37] gundinatorr: whats the addon for the spellbook?
[7:20:38] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[7:20:39] haackster: dont need recall lol
[7:20:47] BillyTang: holy
[7:20:50] novak_back: i think launch will be nuts, and they dont need many servers.. it will die down eventually but as long as there is a core group of people the game can go on forever
[7:20:51] hate_xyz: no shot he survived
[7:20:53] RunicTitan: flagged too wtf
[7:20:56] phreshh: Hes trying to get you to heal him
[7:20:58] phreshh: Because hes healed
[7:20:58] gil910: what most people enjoyed about classic was either the min-maxing, or the casual gaming, none of both will be possible in the same way on HC
[7:21:09] ArmaniSalsa: wow
[7:21:10] igorra_: Imagine shaman gets one use of ankh for lore purposes
[7:21:11] novak_back: blizzard always does too many servers and then they die out and people are forced to pay $25 to transfer which blizzard profits from
[7:21:13] zbatindabutt: The quest you picked up is grey
[7:21:15] Aculus: this ost tho

[7:33:10] Pinkytz88: NODDERS
[7:33:12] rebornzim: some people like to suffer
[7:33:18] vHettwer: HC you can go at your own pace, retail is just everyday farming and no downtime
[7:33:21] novak_back: a lot of quality of life features in retail were due to plummeting player count
[7:33:21] vision42g: yea but at some point it also gets super ez doin the same shit over and over
[7:33:23] gil910: retail to me is proof that it's not easy making challenging content fun
[7:33:29] davicous1: que for a dungeon takes away the community interaction
[7:33:29] sagmaxx: sozial play - you can leave all group and look for a new group
[7:33:31] talli123: retail snooze

[7:33:50] xPapaPls: in the next patch you don't even need to visit mount trainer to train riding @shroud
[7:33:50] Spade711: were masacists
[7:33:51] ovey0: imGlitch
[7:33:52] TheDeathbinder: what i don't like is the bullshit mission tables and AP point grinding

[7:33:53] WaysOP: things just feel more impactful in classic
[7:33:53] Ez_Fn_Pz: walk of shame back to ur lvl

[7:33:54] woodsycka: YEAH WOW souls edition
[7:33:56] acidravelamp: pre mainstream mmo life
[7:33:56] talikars: "pain" "suffering" all these words just mean community :P
[7:34:00] Mando1TV: You have to suffer -David Goggins
[7:34:01] Cloud1k: gives you time to talk to the team to learn what you did good
[7:34:03] Slid_1: the massive runs back to the raid.
[7:34:03] SordMasta: transmog is the best
[7:34:08] Kemist: It breaks immersion. Which some people just don't care about
[7:34:13] novak_back: so true
[7:34:16] LCTR_: dungeon finder is a killer to the experience tho, same with flying mounts - it's easier but you lose the heart of the experience
[7:34:16] Biddy_: tmog is the only reason i play retail
[7:34:17] ArmaniSalsa: @MandoTGR Callous your mouse
[7:34:18] diegodg0: the harder it is, the funnier. what is the fun on a game you finish during one day?
[7:34:18] xelaoso: Wish it was like eso transmog
[7:34:18] gil910: transmog ruined the game so much
[7:34:19] flirtle: very good take
[7:34:22] Cuttytrout: its like wearing achieves tho
[7:34:26] novak_back: you see someone and groan cause its going to interupt your gameplay
[7:34:26] Eluneminati: Seeing Unbreakable with Hand of Rag you mean?
[7:34:26] n0vember: retail is like action rpg
[7:34:27] Aluru1: retail is a speedy game, made for new generation where everything is fast.. classic you just sit there waiting for you 3.2aspd weapon to swig and get happy when it crits
[7:34:30] Cloud1k: yup
[7:34:30] ZEHOGANY: I agree
[7:34:30] Aubue: there're pros and cons
[7:34:34] zathonian94: or a shaman in a purple dress
[7:34:34] qbabattoir: Real gear Pog
[7:34:39] vHettwer: @xPapaPls Shit, really? Thats bad, man. Those were the memorable moments I keep from my first days in wow
[7:34:41] knowpanties: the only bad part about retail is forced dailies, and LFR and LFG that killed the community. in wrath most people transitioned to just doing LFR and LFG
[7:34:42] SuperDuckiez: ive seen people have tmog competitions
[7:34:45] Pinkytz88: seeing someone in full r14 and knowing he put his life on hold to get that KEKW
[7:34:48] novak_back: quality of life but also reactive features. blizzard used to be a proactive company
[7:34:53] handgestured: The reason they love transmog is the reason items have lost their meaning, besides numbers for stats
[7:34:53] Ez_Fn_Pz: it just takes something away....
[7:34:57] bluehppo: shroud, play pubg again please
[7:34:57] HotChocolate_: @Aluru1 hapy crib noizes
[7:34:58] Daidrel: I have to kinda disagree, transmog is good in both, hence why newer content you have to actually unlock to transmog
[7:34:58] javaxtv: I love my mage tower transmogs, feels so good to get it xD
[7:34:59] TheeGoldenHour: @shroud you have to earn the item before you can transmog its look
[7:35:03] Bombshelly_: Also the hard raids compared to classic ones
[7:35:04] Cwarush: I remember standing in aww at the priests wearing t6 in Shatt in original TBC
[7:35:07] Caspertoo: MOUSE?
[7:35:08] novak_back: giving players what they want is one thing but understanding why they want those things instead is better
[7:35:08] elimud: classic wow is seriously lightning in a bottle
[7:35:11] SordMasta: transmog and barber is great because its an rpg in the end of all. not a "gossip about passer-bys simulator" :P
[7:35:13] sant0s____: !addons
[7:35:13] Fossabot: @sant0s____ Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[7:35:17] Fortearmure: I personnaly hate retail now, cause i have to play with my interface all the time !
[7:35:21] desh_yo: i hate skins and trnsmogs, just takes the value of achieving something
[7:35:22] woodsycka: its not as punishing retail
[7:35:23] DeleteThisAccountAlready: shroudDab
[7:35:24] zs3000: Transmog is good for the game
[7:35:24] NaManDatAintMe: its not earning it if you walk into a legacy raid and 1 shot everything
[7:35:25] themostfowl: what i love about classic-wrath is how much more rooted you are in the world
[7:35:29] Jimbagg: Agreed, not a fan of the teleporting and transmog as a classic player
[7:35:33] k24fur: @shroud  hay i just  dont like how if im lvling with my bf and doing every quest we hit a point where every mob stayed lvl 30 and we where one slotting every thing at lvl 40 since nohting seems to be hugher lvl got super boring
[7:35:33] merkwurk: absolutely facts!
[7:35:34] vision42g: m+ for classic?
[7:35:36] jovial_bard: I would agree if the gear didn't make you look like a tin can clown
[7:35:43] b_vern: their progression should show
[7:35:43] Ez_Fn_Pz: you should see a weapon and knows its effects, not have to inspect to see the real weapon
[7:35:45] talikars: Tmog is good for a single player game
[7:35:46] dragoniitezz: I like classic because it gave me a chance to start at a level playing field with everyone instead of 15 years behind
[7:35:46] vHettwer: I mean there should be a toggle Xmog on/off, for your char and everyone's
[7:35:47] knowpanties: retails not harder, it's moir difficult in some ways, burt raid mechanis and boss mechanis in general are way easier in retail
[7:35:49] handgestured: literally fake version xD
[7:35:49] mikehawkk45: there isnt gear that has a wow factor anymore though
[7:35:49] Chaosmourne: @NaManDatAintMe its literally what theyre doing in classic rn KEKW
[7:35:49] igorra_: For you
[7:35:51] DAUCUS_: Too bad all the best gear in vanilla is all mismatching >_>
[7:35:54] Daidrel: But you have to earn the item to get it, and some gear looks cooler than others lol it also tells you the item they wield
[7:35:56] shoonerz: I'd love to have an option to just turn Transmog off so it always shows the players gear as is.
[7:35:56] HeirOfNothingInParticular: @NaManDatAintMe that's a good way to put it imo
[7:35:59] Aluru1: classic is just chill, simple, very easy, and very slow
[7:36:01] eso_ren: pantheon is
[7:36:03] kornjacks: @shroud like batch in TBC you would see a guy in full T6 and be like damn that guy is insane
[7:36:06] desh_yo: its like buying a nuke skin from the store in cod
[7:36:13] Cloud1k: New world
[7:36:14] Omnomvex: maybe a toggle on and off option to show real gear?
[7:36:16] zixxixx: i remember pre-tmog walking into ironforge and seeing a paladin in full tier 2 and just wanting to be that guy
[7:36:18] Aluru1: sometimes less is more
[7:36:19] hermlog: Seeing someone in OSRS with sweaty gear is hype
[7:36:19] „Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑÂêçÂâç: are you really that impressed by loot in any MMO still at this point? LUL just being honest
[7:36:21] woodsycka: well FFXIV is all about fashion
[7:36:22] Pinkytz88: same NODDERS
[7:36:26] nospleen187: lol you almost never walk, just jump none stop. Why is that?
[7:36:26] novak_back: games like Eve, runescape etc. where you can lose the gear I think is the key otherwise it gets stale. people get their BIs and quit
[7:36:28] SordMasta: no-transmog is very gamey and unimmersive. transmog makes you think of why and whats the story behind the char.
[7:36:33] xelaoso: I like tmog but i see your point 100%
[7:36:38] HeirOfNothingInParticular: BiS is it's own set, you can still collect full tier1/2/3 and rock it in town, think of people equipping teebu's etc
[7:36:39] mikehawkk45: everyone would just look the exact same these days though
[7:36:39] flashnickgg: NOTED
[7:36:40] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[7:36:44] PBRbiter: i like that you can go kill old content to try and find something for your tmog
[7:36:52] Graye00420: i like tmog but i see what youre saying
[7:36:54] p1mack: Yea I loved when you got that fire piece of gear you‚Äôd been wanting and know not many have
[7:36:55] Dakkon330: Any information on HC oficial server , mean trading and auction hause will be off?  like now on addon ? Or we dont know yet ?
[7:36:59] davicous1: i only cared about tmog for getting all the gear with my max level char in all the previous gen raids
[7:37:00] ZEHOGANY: fr it sucks
[7:37:00] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[7:37:05] RunicTitan: Just make new gear not tmog-able
[7:37:07] GTokie: especially when blizzard reuses the same skins for like 10 years with dif colors
[7:37:07] RunicTitan: idk
[7:37:09] novak_back: retail wow is about collecting cosmetics like transmogs and mounts. thats the end game. every content update your gear progress is reset
[7:37:16] pat_awesome: i mean its just tmog, its not life or death
[7:37:20] StarlightNebula_: @Dakkon330 No info at all, only it's coming soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
[7:37:24] Fossabot: Socials: https://twitter.com/Shroud - https://www.youtube.com/shroud - https://www.reddit.com/r/Shroud/ - http://www.instagram.com/shroud
[7:37:31] desh_yo: u just look at a dude and dont care about their armour cuz it can be a skin or a tmog so whatever
[7:37:31] Sam_Dust: it becomes a wardrobe collection
[7:37:35] xkitoTV: it has its pros and cons
[7:37:35] monkeslol: 40-45
[7:37:41] druglord256: sorreyPoint sorreyGod mistwa2Hype mistwa2Fire2
[7:37:41] „Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑÂêçÂâç: loot stopped being "cool" when you realize it gets replaced every expac anyway
[7:37:41] Arpolo2: walking into feralas monkaS
[7:37:42] oneneoeun: 43-44 wolves
[7:37:43] JakloomGaming770: why are we running through feralas?
[7:37:43] Pthumeriann: respectfully disagree, ppl love hc for the community not the pain. it‚Äôs a true MMO bottom to top
[7:37:44] handgestured: Majority doesnt know what they want, they just want it easy
[7:37:45] woodsycka: legendary and epic items shouldnt be transmogable and the best in slot
[7:37:52] Danny__L: best zone in the game here
[7:37:53] KillnDestroy: Most gear is just cookie cutter looking anymore in retail. If you didn't have tmog everyone would look like dogshit
[7:37:56] Graye00420: @shroud  in retail if you didnt have tmog everyone would just look the same
[7:38:01] davicous1: community classic was way better than retail imo
[7:38:02] KirkTheCaptain: stuck in-between... i love the idea of on look being able to see someones achievements
[7:38:02] KDawgin: are there no mounts in classic?
[7:38:03] desh_yo: imagine tmog ur prius into a lambo
[7:38:06] Leggahots: shroud why no instant ghost wolf?
[7:38:06] HeirOfNothingInParticular: @Pthumeriann true MMO with no trading for 99% of the players? idk
[7:38:08] KirkTheCaptain: but also i wanna look how i wanna look lolk
[7:38:08] Haishish: both
[7:38:09] merkwurk: other classes can wear different class looks 2 in retail.. that took the point of the actual Class gear looks
[7:38:12] MrWafer29: clueless
[7:38:14] EzMoney1234: why are those 2 mutually exclusive?
[7:38:16] EzMoney1234: can't it be both?
[7:38:16] v2Occy: the pain makes the community
[7:38:22] Ez_Fn_Pz: u dont do this for community, its basicly solo
[7:38:22] SpungoWungo: both
[7:38:23] novak_back: if it wasnt for the fact that the addon will say my death and my last message i probably wouldnt bother with HC ngl
[7:38:27] mattynuts: @KDawgin mounts at level 40 (60% speed) and 60 (100% speed) in vanilla/classic wow
[7:38:31] qbabattoir: monkaS
[7:38:31] EzMoney1234: i love when ppl say shit like that as if it's only 1 of those
[7:38:32] mjtown: its definitely for the pain
[7:38:33] StarlightNebula_: Death monkaW
[7:38:34] Dakkon330: @Lumicox yea i know that will be delete after death but its oficial info too ? no ah no trade system ? or blizzard make some compromiss
[7:38:37] KDawgin: @KDawgin ty
[7:38:44] hate_xyz: peepoRun
[7:38:48] woodsycka: dont you dare due there
[7:39:02] SordMasta: the slowness and the punishment creates the community. in retail people barely talk any more. because they dont have to
[7:39:13] Hannibal1101: anyone else think Dragonflight is an actual good xpac? WoW has sucked especially bad since WoD but I lvl to max then quit. Dragonflight has me sticking around
[7:39:13] king_tedward: @SordMasta there is no community in HC
[7:39:15] OssewTV: its a recipe drop
[7:39:20] Aluru1: i like tmog to use my raid set from previous patch/expansion into the next until i start getting the new parts
[7:39:22] DeleteThisAccountAlready: How long are you going to keep that character
[7:39:22] baudet94: rare af recipe
[7:39:22] acidravelamp: its a recipe drop in barrens
[7:39:22] caffeinefreedietcocacola: the recipe drops in barrens
[7:39:24] shoonerz: the recipe is a drop.
[7:39:33] Arpolo2: @Leggahots instant ghost wolf isnt a thing in classic, the talents is 2 points to make it a 1 sec cast
[7:39:36] Biddy_: @shroud did you see the big vrising update?
[7:39:40] SnowFlakeRyan: farming a world drop lmao
[7:39:41] bigdogdrew1: GL
[7:39:44] baudet94: @shroud its a legit world drop from mobs ion the teens
[7:39:46] haackster: raqndom drop in barrens
[7:39:46] OssewTV: its a "world drop"
[7:39:52] kumsukn: !addons
[7:39:52] Fossabot: @kumsukn Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[7:39:53] kumbayaa666: i got that recipe lvl 7
[7:39:53] Leggahots: @Leggahots aah yes
[7:39:58] bigdogdrew1: barrens world drop
[7:40:00] MrWafer29: if HC is so cool than do it on retail
[7:40:01] haackster: cn drop in chests too
[7:40:06] mattynuts: @shroud When offical HC comes out, what's the policy going to be if someone griefs you while leveling? Say a rogue vanishes mobs on you or something.
[7:40:11] SpungoWungo: @Hannibal1101 Im leveling through it for the first time right now the zones are way more chill than shadowlands so far
[7:40:13] acidravelamp: the drop % is skewed, its not too uncommon jsut farming in barrens
[7:40:14] Thurrak: check the AH?
[7:40:14] ZEHOGANY: I hate when people f up the auction house by undercutting like %60 of the market price its wack
[7:40:18] Goulakis: Is this skadoodle ???
[7:40:24] OssewTV: if u get a speed pot recipe drop on official HC u would make bank lol
[7:40:25] baudet94: @mattynuts you get gud shouldve seen the rogue coming
[7:40:27] shoonerz: @MrWafer29 Retail leveling would take 10 hours.
[7:40:30] QuTips_: its a world drop in low level zones
[7:40:36] TeaCamp: can you hearth in HC?
[7:40:40] QuTips_: yup
[7:40:42] Goulakis: Bnans
[7:40:44] MrWafer29: @MrWafer29 if you dont die
[7:40:45] mattynuts: @baudet94 nice
[7:40:52] Aluru1: @MrWafer29 around 7 if i`m not mistaken
[7:40:52] novak_back: official hc is going to be one very interesting experiment
[7:40:54] Killik21: @shroud I love you
[7:40:55] RunicTitan: @TeaCamp No bubble hearth is the only rule afaik
[7:40:55] Arpolo2: @TeaCamp yes just not bubble hearth
[7:40:58] Dakkon330: @Lumicox ok so trade will be live... and auction house ? :)... or we dont have oficial info of these things
[7:41:00] sickayou: its just random RNG, 5 characters later, onlyseen it on my first
[7:41:00] Leggahots: @Leggahots still not bad if u have to run fast
[7:41:01] OssewTV: @TeaCamp yea no bubble hearthing
[7:41:05] TeaCamp: thx all
[7:41:13] TheeGoldenHour: whats bubble hearth
[7:41:14] Fortearmure: haha
[7:41:15] Pthumeriann: it just sucks that the effect of HC is what makes the world feel less empty as you level
[7:41:20] kushheadcam: have no knowledge of World of Warcraft but yall are entertaining me while im at work
[7:41:20] Goulakis: 60 today?
[7:41:20] DadBodHotRod: good grinding xp Pog
[7:41:27] Fortearmure: But i hate retail for all the addon corumption and shit
[7:41:28] v2Occy: thats an AH item
[7:41:32] Goulakis: Retail no?
[7:41:35] Danny__L: it's a great potion tho, amazing for pvp
[7:41:40] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[7:41:40] CBear0414: @lumicox that‚Äôs not true. We have no details.
[7:41:47] GTokie: i tried farming that in wotlk was a mistake
[7:41:48] mattynuts: @Pthumeriann but when you do run into another player. It's respectable
[7:41:50] ExtraCinica: @Danny__L pvp in hc KEKW
[7:41:54] Arpolo2: @xGoldenHour paladin spell Divine Shield makes u immune to dmg for 10 secs, then using ur hearthstone
[7:41:56] Dakkon330: @Lumicox ok ,, but trading char to char is still on , live... ok so people can trading items, golds everything without auction
[7:41:57] Goulakis: Where the f I am
[7:41:57] RunicTitan: I had 2 deviate recipes drop on my mage before hitting 20
[7:41:58] baudet94: @shroud you just have to farm it out if you want it, probably take you 2-3 hours both grinding which is a small portion of your overall time played
[7:42:01] novak_back: i think deviate delight is more valuable on ally cause the demand is higher. gnomes and dwarves love it
[7:42:08] Hannibal1101: @SpungoWungo HIGHLY recommend getting the dragon lvl'd up as you go. I waited until 70 and once I had it upgraded I realized how bad I handicapped myself
[7:42:09] verLo_: I had to farm Crusader enchant back when classic first released
[7:42:13] Goulakis: !age
[7:42:13] Fossabot: @Goulakis He's 28 :)
[7:42:16] Danny__L: @Extracinica i know just saying, in the regular game it makes sense for it to be a hard recipe to get
[7:42:18] BizarreNature: whats the addon telling u step by step?
[7:42:21] VanDomand: when i played on alliance wrath classic release those recipes were going for 1k g each on my server
[7:42:23] novak_back: its a horde only drop same with elixir of giants growth i think
[7:42:29] SpaceVoyage: @BizarreNature restedxp
[7:42:32] novak_back: i mean ally can get it but horde zones
[7:42:34] Goulakis: !bnans
[7:42:34] Fossabot: @Goulakis, bnans is Hannah, shroud's girlfriend. She streams at twitch.tv/bnans
[7:42:34] haackster: i found mine in chest in WC
[7:42:40] JJJnray1: swiftness recipe is hard to get
[7:42:45] Xarcakes: whats that questing addon right above your webcam called?
[7:42:46] Zeshhly: Engiee dummies reallly good 2
[7:42:47] BizarreNature: @BizarreNature ty
[7:42:47] acidravelamp: warstomp resists easy
[7:42:50] Zeshhly: saved me many times
[7:42:50] HeirOfNothingInParticular: are we talking about deviate delight recipe? last time i had one was before tbc launch sold it for like 120g lol
[7:42:51] SpungoWungo: @Hannibal1101 maybe thats what I will do right now I have barely done that
[7:42:53] Aluru1: i got deviate delight on my dead one and swiftness in my non alch lol
[7:42:55] ZEHOGANY: any raw gold exploits in dragon flight? I feel like im only making gold off bags rn
[7:42:55] Pthumeriann: @mattynuts yea that‚Äôs my point. all of the people are at the bottom rather than retail where everyone is at the top, empty worlds
[7:43:00] Gremmel: I think I've always gotten the swiftness recipe from fishing the supplies hotspots
[7:43:05] saluu95: is this tbc or wrath?
[7:43:14] novak_back: is swiftness that great? i feel like if it saves you a regular potion probably would too
[7:43:15] Thurrak: are you able to buy stuff on the AH on HC?
[7:43:18] RunicTitan: Farm the kolkar keys for the kolkar chests, easy to find recipes
[7:43:23] mattynuts: @shroud that's smart to play a character with the ability reincarnation. Surely that's allowed in HC
[7:43:27] Houstonqtx: @saluu95 Classic Era
[7:43:30] Hannibal1101: @SpungoWungo it doesn't take a lot of time, but drastically improves getting around
[7:43:31] Dakkon330: @Lumicox ah i see... must be on groupe of same dungeon, cant trading with other world person who was not with me on dungeon
[7:43:38] reeshatron: Every one of these notifications is a ruined afternoon
[7:43:41] one_adam_12: Go booty bay to get ur fishing book
[7:43:44] king_tedward: @Pthumeriann true theres big bottlenecks on some areas and people quitting at 60 because they've completed it in their eyes prob adds to it
[7:43:45] SpungoWungo: @Hannibal1101 gotcha thanks
[7:43:45] saluu95: @saluu95 fucking sick
[7:43:53] novak_back: what if it was a 30 day cooldown
[7:44:00] xPapaPls: Clueless surely
[7:44:01] jStapesx: what is that questing addon you have called?
[7:44:02] trollbaby13: ya havent even trained soulstone
[7:44:03] novak_back: LUL
[7:44:04] Xanderbayne: Shroud there is a way to clean up your herbalism nodes to take ones in a bunch and then count as one node. it will really clear up your map
[7:44:05] RunicTitan: @shroud Farm kolkar keys for their chests, might be better for farming recipes.
[7:44:06] theguyinthehoodie420: anyone know of a good server to play normal classic on?
[7:44:17] Stealinheals: dungeon
[7:44:20] Tabski__: shamans should get a single-use reincarnate
[7:44:21] bballaustin: rfk
[7:44:21] MrHustlemanTv: Hey bro I started streaming because of you. The day we ran into each other at the coffee shop. You gave me motivation bro!
[7:44:21] Shalestorm: dungeon yea
[7:44:21] novak_back: i feel like reinc and soulstone are great parts of their respective classes but no idea how to balance that in hardcore
[7:44:24] FreeVeeThree: ... so what do you get for getting to max?
[7:44:25] Rosindogg: Yes rfk
[7:44:29] davicous1: haha blue leaf tubers.. you need all the items for it
[7:44:29] MikeyMarc: @shroud kalkar chest for swiftness recipe. trust bro
[7:44:34] Fortearmure: Did you do a dungeon yet ?
[7:44:37] TheHubbub: how was sfk?
[7:44:38] thirdpartyp: @Tabski__
[7:44:39] king_tedward: @theguyinthehoodie420 all the pvp servers are linked so any works on classic era
[7:44:39] bballaustin: rfk is mid 20s
[7:44:43] Shalestorm: You just uh dont have them lmao
[7:44:44] mattynuts: @Mrhustlemantv That's inspiring. Good luck bro.
[7:44:45] chrisburhans: @jStapesx RestedXP
[7:44:51] woodsycka: just deactivate it
[7:44:51] thirdpartyp: @Tabski__  what do you mean? how would that be fair
[7:44:52] Kemist: They should allow Goblin Jumper Cable rez only EZ
[7:44:52] TheGodOfCobras: Last boss of RFK is lvl 33
[7:44:52] novak_back: one time ever
[7:45:00] Shalestorm: Nah just remove them lol
[7:45:03] MrHustlemanTv: Do you remember the day we ran into each other at the scooters coffee shop around a year ago. Well I finally started streaming because of you
[7:45:06] novak_back: yeah its so hard to figure out how to make them work
[7:45:13] TheHubbub: make it a dice roll 1 time
[7:45:13] FreeVeeThree: @lumicox sounds awesome ü§£
[7:45:14] OssewTV: nah remove em or make em like a shield wall maybe idk
[7:45:15] Arpolo2: make SS and ank a passive that heals when at like 10% hp for a small heal or something
[7:45:15] N3O_Monkey: is that rested xp?
[7:45:22] KevinNahmsayin: spends time fixing missing quests
[7:45:23] novak_back: most i can think of is when you dieit procs instant and heals you
[7:45:26] KevinNahmsayin: misses quests
[7:45:29] king_tedward: I hate when people say Jaina and Alexstrasza are hotter than Chromie. Will Jaina or Alexstrasza stay with you after you're finished with them? No. Can you fit them in your pocket and use them whenever you want? No. Would they make out with you in public? No, lol, didn't think so.
[7:45:32] MrWafer29: hot take
[7:45:34] QuTips_: there's no class quest that requires you to use soul stone right?
[7:45:37] selchie3: I think the simple answer is just remove ankh/soulstone. or maybe change them to something different?
[7:45:37] snedges: I hate when people say Jaina and Alexstrasza are hotter than Chromie. Will Jaina or Alexstrasza stay with you after you're finished with them? No. Can you fit them in your pocket and use them whenever you want? No. Would they make out with you in public? No, lol, didn't think so.
[7:45:37] jonnicle: ctrl z
[7:45:45] Fortearmure: lol
[7:45:52] tak0g0dz: Aware Scooter Incident
[7:45:54] gojiburr: damn
[7:45:59] chaotixwolfe: chaotixwolfe subscribed with Prime. 
[7:46:03] Fortearmure: Lol rip
[7:46:04] hirath1: how many characters do you have for hc rn
[7:46:06] gojiburr: thats gotta be devastating
[7:46:06] Fr0nti3r: sounds like a bot advertisement lol
[7:46:07] Galexiis: Is he playing on Blizzard server or a private one?
[7:46:08] novak_back: say rank 1 if you take a deadly blow, instead it brings you back to 100hp. that might be fair assuming agro doesnt drop
[7:46:09] rochem: How's hc going
[7:46:11] vHettwer: I hate when people say Jaina and Alexstrasza are hotter than Chromie. Will Jaina or Alexstrasza stay with you after you're finished with them? No. Can you fit them in your pocket and use them whenever you want? No. Would they make out with you in public? No, lol, didn't think so.
[7:46:12] MrWafer29: @Hirath1 12
[7:46:13] mattynuts: @shroud what talents are you leveling with?
[7:46:18] zackplayinggames: Can hunters feign death in HC?
[7:46:20] Evilnside: triprunners Pog
[7:46:24] RevansMask: for you it was the greatest moment of your life for me it was a tuesday  _ M.Bison
[7:46:26] novak_back: cheat death
[7:46:30] mattynuts: @zackplayinggames of course they can lol.
[7:46:30] BigZeezer: Do you remember the day we ran into each other at scoobers coffee shop? I started streaming because of you.
[7:46:31] Karnage_105: make it a cheat death ya
[7:46:33] novak_back: maybe even heal
[7:46:39] wakeandbacon95: cool sham
[7:46:40] wolf79x: Like prot pala cheat death
[7:46:40] boyhasheart: good idea
[7:46:41] Arpolo2: just make it a small heal at low hp%
[7:46:42] SpungoWungo: ya that could work
[7:46:42] novak_back: the key is it activates isntantly and doesnt work as a agro reset
[7:46:45] mattynuts: Feign death isn't as OP as it sounds if it get's resisted
[7:46:46] MrWafer29: @zackplayinggames yikes!
[7:46:48] mattynuts: which happens
[7:46:48] Shalestorm: Just remove it XD its not that deep

[7:46:54] davicous1: cheat death
[7:46:56] X424: Their*
[7:46:56] No_Skill_Scrub: nah theyll just let you die and not change anything
[7:46:58] dazann: acts lika cheat death talent or something
[7:47:03] TheeGoldenHour: @shroud how is Official HC going to have appels like the addon has i feel like without the appeals it wouldnt be worth it
[7:47:07] RunicTitan: Feign death? :p
[7:47:07] novak_back: yeah its sort of like the rogue talent
[7:47:07] woodsycka: Better just take it off
[7:47:08] Shalestorm: why not just remove it. Warlock is already the strongest class in hardcore lol
[7:47:10] theGraye: as long as you can't leave combat
[7:47:14] novak_back: i feel like its integral to the class in some ways
[7:47:19] 4rson: official HC is gonna be fun
[7:47:20] Fortearmure: I want appeals !
[7:47:21] novak_back: oh yeah bubble hearth thats another debate
[7:47:23] BigZeezer: this is the wow community.
[7:47:28] soClutchItHurts: DC
[7:47:29] Fortearmure: Appeals are important for the game !
[7:47:30] Shalestorm: REMINDER THAT BUBBLE HEARTH IS 50+ COMBO.
[7:47:31] TheDeathbinder: Blizzard handling stuff like shit as usual
[7:47:34] BigZeezer: 100%
[7:47:35] davicous1: lag off.. for a long fall
[7:47:38] RunicTitan: All I want is SSF. Idgaf about death = delete tbh
[7:47:38] soClutchItHurts: Spyro simulator
[7:47:39] novak_back: remember when blizzard did the work of solving that for us. thats the company we want back
[7:47:39] TheRonWeedsley: Bubble hearth isn't allowed right?
[7:47:41] BigZeezer: it do be what it do be
[7:47:45] WootWoot: Shit happens, same stuff happens in OSRS @shroud
[7:47:47] Haishish: what about griefers
[7:47:49] Slid_1: death by elevator
[7:47:51] selchie3: No way blizzard will do death appeals, so it's gonna be rough
[7:47:51] xithus: no appeals, hell yeah
[7:47:51] jordan2d2: People die in crazy ways Kappa
[7:47:51] TheHubbub: hearth on cd after bubble
[7:47:53] martacus423: go agane
[7:47:55] Fortearmure: We need appeals ! It's important
[7:47:57] Aluru1: classic wow players get upset for anything KEKW
[7:47:58] ZEHOGANY: wyd with flight stones in DF
[7:48:01] Danny__L: they can make so that you can't actually cast hearth when bubbled
[7:48:04] soClutchItHurts: 60 or nuttin
[7:48:06] Biddy_: @shroud did you see the big vrising update? Û†ÄÄ
[7:48:07] OssewTV: @RunicTitan u can play SSF just dont expect others to do
[7:48:09] mattynuts: @shroud Imagine they hire game masters for HC servers.
[7:48:11] No_Skill_Scrub: I mean go read the diablo 2 manual part about HC chars. They basically say "we wont do anything no matter what, you chose HC too bad"
[7:48:11] Itsameaspagaro: so what happens if you fall off the flight tower
[7:48:11] manny_geee: they should have a warning before playing
[7:48:12] gojiburr: monkaW
[7:48:17] jook: sounds fun
[7:48:17] knowpanties: the one people are already having a big deal with is, no res at all even to griefers
[7:48:17] QuTips_: yeah hearth apparently will be put on CD the moment you use bubble
[7:48:19] NoandThen: they prolly will gms
[7:48:21] v2Occy: but they can die
[7:48:21] 4rson: It's going to be so much fun
[7:48:24] soClutchItHurts: who can stay on the longest
[7:48:24] TheEnstraynomic: Blizzard even says that they will never resurrect dead characters in hardcore diablo wither
[7:48:25] swordkingguts: if they dont make it SSF im not even bothering lol
[7:48:26] davicous1: you can jump off flight tower and live
[7:48:26] iwasbandnowimnot: PepeLaugh
[7:48:27] Arpolo2: wont ppl just stick to this addon and reg servers then?
[7:48:28] Haishish: sould hand out bands to griefers
[7:48:28] z_ke: the griefers can die too though - its not safe for them
[7:48:28] novak_back: blizzard if you are reading this message, just hire a few GMs to float around in ghost mode. swimming around moderating thats all we ask. we'll even pay for it
[7:48:31] toomers_: taht can still get banned
[7:48:31] k46ooM: what happens when u die ?
[7:48:31] Rockyside1: at least griefers can die too
[7:48:32] mavus: Hopefully Blizzard still bans a bunch
[7:48:33] SpungoWungo: have they comfirmed no appeals
[7:48:35] GhostfaceQ: PepeLaugh
[7:48:37] Globalkillerr: nah theyll 100% have appeals
[7:48:41] RunicTitan: @RunicTitan wdym, SSF is hardcore right now. Why would that be a problem :p I cant do it because non hc = no grps at all ever.
[7:48:45] dcraftjr: @z_ke not if they bubble hearth and mass pull
[7:48:45] novak_back: if blizzar dis tough on banning griefing people wont do it
[7:48:45] kahrazy: GMs in 2023 blizzard? y'all sure are confident
[7:48:45] ethnometh: Honestly brother i feel like that just makes it all the less attractive.
[7:48:46] Ausden: @z_ke a lvl60 kiting lvl40 elites are 100% safe
[7:48:48] Steeveee: can you transfer 60s from unofficial servers?
[7:48:50] k46ooM: @Lumicox damn
[7:48:50] thedabbernaut: ressurection will be a paid service
[7:48:52] nauraog: Yes its so nice to have when you need it
[7:48:53] TheSparkyDog: Leave it to players to grief their own game that they want people to play, inevitably making them quit... lol.
[7:48:55] Shalestorm: and in more creeative ways too - like forgetting to heal in dung. fearing mobs into other packs. spamming curse of reck on ppls mobs. all of which cant really be reportable like scatter feign . can play coy and say they were just mistakes or thought they were helping :P
[7:48:59] OssewTV: @swordkingguts its not gunna be SSF ... wow is an mmo and they already said its up to the player on how they wanna play HC.
[7:49:00] SPLOINGUS_KHAN: zed
[7:49:05] Leggahots: shroud astral recall saves u a bag slot!
[7:49:05] b_vern: there will not be appeals and it will not be SSF. bare minimum effort here is what to expect
[7:49:05] novak_back: but we need real Gms, not AI automated report algorithms. we need the GM that would literally spawn on me and RP to fix my issue KEKW
[7:49:05] saluu95: healer or dps build?
[7:49:11] Xtaro: if you play with a duo/trio you're really only as strong as your weakest or dumbest player
[7:49:14] SpungoWungo: they could also ban those accounts on retail and classic
[7:49:20] KamikazeKitty: If you dc irl and die you dont get an appeal. It's HC, 1 life no matter what
[7:49:25] NoMoreSadness: @Globalkillerr did u watch the official reveal?
[7:49:31] Booowii: D:
[7:49:36] milkyvai: no appeal system , maybe they just will ban ppl , so u create new account @shroud
[7:49:37] NoandThen: they have ppl that look at reports can have some look at appeals
[7:49:37] Protomateria: lol
[7:49:38] poopo_6: are ppl gonna be playing hardcore after like 2 months tho?
[7:49:41] davicous1: different cd
[7:49:41] Shalestorm: People will still ujse addon on official and have guilds for it too
[7:49:45] homeskillet20: i wish they make hardcore servers for retail too
[7:49:46] novak_back: @Lumicox im worried only people who grief streamers will get banned
[7:49:52] OssewTV: if u want SSF / appeals stay on bloodsail ... and use the HC addon

[7:51:05] RunicTitan: I want SSF lite; so trading crafted items is ok but not dropped items. (and crafting ingredients is fine)
[7:51:06] latenightsuckmeright: bloodsail will die and they addon will live on
[7:51:12] novak_back: classic wow is one of those games with so many quriks it really needs that delicate touch in the form of in game moderation

[7:52:26] king_tedward: the addon is the reason for HC
[7:52:28] Raeliff: didnt it start with the iron man challenge ?
[7:52:34] Shalestorm: @Lawblades NODDERS
[7:52:35] king_tedward: all the money from the addon went towards the project im p sure
[7:52:37] OssewTV: HC has been out before tbc classic launch
[7:52:46] davicous1: i feel like mages are super reluctant to just aoe mobs in a raid or party lol
[7:52:52] skawa__: Its because MMorpgs back in the days all had perma death or heavy penaltys on death like loosing gear and sstuff

[7:56:54] juniperhighway: just go so sfk?
[7:56:58] GlykosRower: @icatelan there are. There are no official HC servers (yet). All of this is community driven and self imposed rules that are tracked with an add-on. if you died other HC people know and won't play with you

[8:00:57] novak_back: im so excited. im so ready to no life hardcore official but i am skeptical
[8:00:58] legndz_tv: gonna be a mess
[8:01:00] Meg_uh: feels like itll be to late
[8:01:01] veiloflonelystars: the addon does it better, lets be honest
[8:01:04] Honeycrispie: blizzard will do it wrong, for sure.
[8:01:05] Vanguards_CR: @shroud I LOVE YOU, SAY IT BACK
[8:01:06] Scheemin: Is it confirmed ??? Official HC!
[8:01:07] KillnDestroy: @drakethegreat3 Rested XP, it's a paid service addon
[8:01:08] king_tedward: too many gray areas on rules
[8:01:09] Winky: LOL i promise i cant answer, but i think itll be good enough, and open to feedback
[8:01:10] slodisgood: I have a feeling it's barebones and people gonna keep using the addon.
[8:01:12] Smoogol: hype will be over by then
[8:01:13] woodsycka: well if they hear the community its a win right
[8:01:18] novak_back: i think the only rule there will be is dead cant rez
[8:01:19] trizket: you think they will add in seasons into classic HC ?
[8:01:19] niceundiesftw: what dont you have high hopes about it?
[8:01:22] smcoffey: People bitch because Blizzard doesn't listen, then when Blizzard listens people still bitch LUL
[8:01:35] novak_back: soulstone reincarnate yueah honestl idk PTR will tell us alot
[8:01:36] 4rson: i dont care if HC sucks it'll be so much fun at first and pure chaos
[8:01:36] zaxal_: if its the addon people want than people will just use the addon on HC officials
[8:01:40] joukspt: what about hardcore mode on diablo 4 are u going to try it?
[8:01:45] MCMXCVI___: trusting blizzard LUL
[8:01:50] novak_back: the HC addon will turn into ironman
[8:01:56] Galoots_: it will be to easy aswell
[8:01:57] caravainilla: The addon rules are better than the basic HC rules blizzard has on official.
[8:01:58] trizket: Thats the classic experience already LUL
[8:01:59] niceundiesftw: i mean that sounds pretty fun
[8:02:00] Honeycrispie: because blizzard always launches scuffed content and then fixes it later.
[8:02:01] jloof94: but at least griefers will be hardcore too
[8:02:03] veiloflonelystars: i dont think the griefing will be bad cause they can die too, its more that boosting and certain things will kill the classic experience
[8:02:05] z_ke: griefers only have 1 life too. it won't be as bad. no way
[8:02:07] WizardWhoHasMoreMPthanHP: Gotta level to grief at least
[8:02:07] Velxir: Its hard to have faith in blizzard to do things right now-a-days
[8:02:07] Winky: i have an answer on griefing for sure
[8:02:08] danielyost: hard to grief when theyre hardcore too
[8:02:15] myfans4141: wow is lawless
[8:02:15] novak_back: its gonna be so exciting
[8:02:18] king_tedward: griefing is a part of the game
[8:02:21] qbabattoir: give HC their own servers
[8:02:22] RunicTitan: @smcoffey Asking for a strawberry but getting a fart =/= listening
[8:02:24] novak_back: imagine you're getting griefer and they die tho
[8:02:24] trizket: Become a pro griefer
[8:02:25] b_vern: you can grief at 20
[8:02:33] buzz_lighthole: ngl griefers make it more exciting
[8:02:34] woodsycka: yeah
[8:02:36] qbabattoir: true‚Ä¶
[8:02:37] Treir44: @shroud asmon and soda were getting greifed hella hard
[8:02:41] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[8:02:46] woodsycka: raid griefing
[8:02:46] caravainilla: the fact is that hunters are the best griefers and they're the easiest or one of the easiest to get to 60 so...
[8:02:47] novak_back: well theres level 1s that were griefing but on HC they would have to start from the starter. no corpse running
[8:02:50] suitlol: i like that you call it griefing but really its just a part of the game
[8:02:54] Winky: id only be worried about deep, deep level 60 griefs tbh
[8:02:55] SudsMcGriddle: could make things interesting, people start putting bounties on griefers for opposing faction to take them out
[8:02:57] Smoogol: they confirmed that the minimum level to grief is 15
[8:02:59] bryy_tv: !addons
[8:02:59] Fossabot: @bryy_tv Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[8:03:03] novak_back: its going to an interesting experiment for sure
[8:03:07] zymper_xd: sad life griefers
[8:03:07] jiggyspice: Turning off PvP or have a dialoge box to confirm turning PvP on. And making it so players cannot kill quest NPC's and scatter shot makes a mob despawn if it has no other enemies in the threat pool
[8:03:08] Winky: like full on inside job griefing
[8:03:09] TheeGoldenHour: 40 kills man 40
[8:03:12] veiloflonelystars: its crazy wow well the classic graphics in this engine held up, well stylized
[8:03:13] lemorte37: I wonder if bands of anti-griefers will form. Since the griefers will die for good
[8:03:13] novak_back: but thats the blizzard we should be embracing, the indy blizzard that experimented
[8:03:15] Alvaldis: The worst part is that when blizzard runs it people will find any way they can to cheat
[8:03:19] Honeycrispie: ur fucked yea
[8:03:21] Kazzorax: !house
[8:03:26] caravainilla: YEP
[8:03:30] imCurt1s: o7
[8:03:33] trizket: dont get got then
[8:03:36] joukspt: are u going to try diablo 4 @shroud ?
[8:03:38] king_tedward: you can grief with a level 1 if you know how
[8:03:40] QuTips_: @Smoogol who is they??
[8:03:42] novak_back: 90% of mainstream will drop off but they might stay subscribed and come back from time to time which is a win for blizz right
[8:03:44] veiloflonelystars: same
[8:03:44] StageName: monitoring it will be so hard
[8:03:46] rullock: !addon
[8:03:46] wonderwaffle407: They'll change mob tagging
[8:03:46] Fossabot: @rullock Here's a list of his WoW addons - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggySparklingDogeJebaited-lehmYUO3a1pHMIbT
[8:03:50] veiloflonelystars: 100%
[8:03:52] gort_industries: FetalJuice - what a name
[8:03:54] novak_back: if they want to keep the susbcription count up they will follow the money
[8:03:54] Jaskaran158: Reputation/Honor for pvp killed 2019 classic
[8:04:03] qfitzzz: World bounty on griefers or people with HKs?
[8:04:06] Smoogol: @Smoogol the ones that DO understand sarcasm
[8:04:06] rob4499: @shroud you should play monster hunter
[8:04:07] myfans4141: griefed, wat you say about youth unemployment
[8:04:07] GlykosRower: Nah play with the add-on in NEW servers.
[8:04:10] legndz_tv: Want a new classic season
[8:04:13] jloof94: yea, i understand the skepticism
[8:04:14] woodsycka: make like a season of mastery
[8:04:16] osoi____: shroud dont worry because ur cute
[8:04:18] zaxal_: the addon would likely get swapped to the new servers
[8:04:19] Winky: i agree with it, i do think blizzard is open to hearing feedback on it, this is a passion project for them so thats reassuring at least
[8:04:23] teggles: for them to slide in and make official servers for something the community already created is kind of sleezy to begin with
[8:04:26] Squee311: i dont think the guys who decided the griuefs are going to not be on the offical servers tho
[8:04:27] king_tedward: Classic + with HC optional server when?
[8:04:28] novak_back: i am all too woried they will in fact do it to keep the sub count up but not for the love of the game like its 2004
[8:04:29] b_vern: there will 100% be streamer bounties LUL
[8:04:33] rubytempest: I know quite a few people who started playing wow for the first time ever or in a very long time just for hc, so maybe enough new blood to support it?
[8:04:38] evanos21: Yo Shrowdy, how you get the icons so pretty?
[8:04:42] woodsycka: oh on the contrary they hear
[8:04:42] makket: Addon= Ssf   hc clasic =Real game
[8:04:44] wonderwaffle407: It's already the shadowlands engine , they can tweak things like griefing probably
[8:04:47] Fossil211: is shroud still with hannah?
[8:04:48] buodild: ptr is gonna be a really big deal for those servers
[8:04:49] smcoffey: there hasn't even been a ptr yet people wont know what changes they will make until then...
[8:04:50] StageName: good point but will it work?
[8:04:50] novak_back: blizzard wants to succeed, microsoft wants blizzard to succeed
[8:04:51] woodsycka: they just dont give a fuck
[8:05:01] veiloflonelystars: @rubytempest hc classic is very welcoming to new players, easy to learn game compared to retail bloated
[8:05:02] ohhdots22: They just need to add warmode and reduce leashinhg
[8:05:03] Squee311: @teggles they want the official servers... at least majority of them that made and have played the HC mode
[8:05:06] ohhdots22: ez
[8:05:06] BR1NGTHERAIN: Clueless
[8:05:09] evanos21: @shroud Yo Shrowdy, how you get the icons so pretty?
[8:05:15] veiloflonelystars: 30-60 day ban fixes alot of griefers
[8:05:25] king_tedward: If you're allowed to do multiple dungeons boosting and RMT will pop off
[8:05:27] Winky: yea, the bans have already started,  they are really standing up for the community right now and i hope they stick to it
[8:05:28] novak_back: what was his name? agni? the rogue that inspired the south park episode? the guy that sat between westfall and evelyn forest? thats classic wow
[8:05:32] BigZeezer: wishful thinking. we had griefs with world bosses forever. nothing ever came to it.
[8:05:35] psychictoad_: are griefers still rampant right now?
[8:05:36] Jaskaran158: Windfury is so good just gotta get lucky
[8:05:42] niceundiesftw: griefing is part of the game though
[8:05:43] qfitzzz: World bounty on players with HKs/ griefers? @shroud
[8:05:46] bazooka_mazooka: hi
[8:05:47] mandurilxl: calls it bad then 2x proccs
[8:05:48] Honeycrispie: its fun though
[8:05:49] RealHoid: It's pog if you have a blue wep
[8:05:50] mandurilxl: xD
[8:05:51] king_tedward: @Winky yeah stand with the money kek
[8:05:53] KevinNahmsayin: how close like 2k?
[8:05:54] veiloflonelystars: only good for shocks
[8:05:54] RunicTitan: Lol yeah I quit the shaman at 30 because I was disappointed
[8:05:56] DrFat00sh: go 1 handers big pog
[8:06:01] evanos21: Yo Shrowdy, how you get the icons so pretty?
[8:06:01] davidsilvarado: "griefing is part of the game" found the griefer KEKW
[8:06:02] NanaCanPlay: how far into 29 is he?
[8:06:03] Nubkips: 40 is pog
[8:06:09] Winky: @king_tedward i wish i got paid LOL
[8:06:15] Magris: shammys cant dw in classic. that started in TBC
[8:06:26] OnlineSometimes: is there gonna be a way to get your character back when official hardcore drops if you die to a disconnect
[8:06:31] trizket: smh
[8:06:31] Fossabot: Subscribe to my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/shroud
[8:06:35] Jaskaran158: HAving Stormstrike at 40 also helps with some more auto chances
[8:06:39] jiggyspice: Turning off PvP or have a dialoge box to confirm turning PvP on. And making it so players cannot kill quest NPC's and scatter shot makes a mob despawn if it has no other enemies in the threat pool. Solves 90% of grief methods
[8:06:41] digitalpanhandlr: i do see the official hardcore battle to the death, will definitely spur on cash tournaments
[8:06:41] RealHoid: WF is really all about the weapon, the other enhancements are more flat increases
[8:06:56] trizket: LUL
[8:06:57] Aluru1: rockbitter is the best dps enh weapon isnt it?
[8:07:02] Fossabot: Subscribe to my second YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmteEZzq7A2qVtXPMeYhAHg/videos
[8:07:06] veiloflonelystars: griefing in pvp server is something, in hardcore its just low life loser behaviour
[8:07:07] novak_back: they might do a separate layer for people who died but honestly if you die in HC no ones gonna be doin normal content
[8:07:14] fijimann: LUL
[8:07:15] Omnixdc: Can you dual wild to make it better?
[8:07:16] GG1Flip: hey can anyone help me is this straight classic or is it wrath of the lich king classic
[8:07:19] Velxir: as shaman do you even bother with dropping the lil totems?
[8:07:19] HercLF: herclfDogboi
[8:07:31] blackop457: !DUO
[8:07:31] Fossabot: @blackop457, He's playing with Tyler "skadoodle"
[8:07:33] king_tedward: depends on the wf proc
[8:07:34] RunicTitan: @RealHoid It's still kind of the same as rockbiter but with the addition of the proc to hit several times.
[8:07:35] fijimann: @gg1flip straight classic
[8:07:38] TheMcBoom: flametongue with a dagger is just so solid
[8:07:40] novak_back: @GG1Flip straight classic son
[8:07:42] davidsilvarado: shamans in general are doodoo in classic ngl
[8:07:44] Winky: i dont think itll be as big of an issue as it is on bloodsail, and if it is blizz is handing out bans left and right atm, lets hope they stick to it
[8:07:52] Squee311: doesnt enh want wf cast on their weapon and then like agilty or is that just TBC?
[8:07:55] widddy: i just wish they open a small section of appeals in the current ticket system, mandate a video and whatever else
[8:07:55] GG1Flip: @fijimann is that what everyone is playing?
[8:08:00] davidsilvarado: for pvp at least
[8:08:04] GlykosRower: @novak1802  no they won't do different layers. They confirmed you want be able to ressurect

[8:08:58] bloodborne60fpsplz: I really regret buying tears of the kingdom, I swear gamers are most most cognitively impaired people of all time, the game runs at like 20 fps and call it a masterpiece, I don't get it
[8:09:07] Brodoswagings: The wf totem will be pretty good for you guys tho
[8:09:10] KeepoChameleon: Isnt pvp part of the challenge? im confused, how to you differentiate between and greifer and a pvp'er

[8:17:53] novak_back: i just hope dungeon boosting isnt a thing and itll be fine
[8:17:53] Pthumeriann: yes. SSF is boring
[8:17:55] Ronin33: i dont get the one dungeon limit
[8:17:56] ClubRetroTalks: turtle wow hardcore is better I think.
[8:17:57] saluu95: @fijimann stranglethorn vale must be brutal as fuck
[8:17:59] soClutchItHurts: dungeon
[8:17:59] gort_industries: commit
[8:18:00] way_back: Hardcore andys want so many rules for the offical servers its crazy, like how are people gonna tell me how I should play?
[8:18:00] DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea: The griefing, falling off flight paths and other bug deaths that can't be appealed will be too bad for me to play
[8:18:07] MO_MURDER25: momurdLetsgo momurdLetsgo momurdLetsgo momurdLetsgo
[8:18:08] Brewsy_: There's definitely going to be at least 2 modes playing alongside each other. Solo self found and free trade/grouping
[8:18:17] gort_industries: but that hunter lmao
[8:18:27] novak_back: theres so much potential
[8:18:28] gravytrain_sd: they should just put a daily lockout on dungeons while leveling
[8:18:28] saluu95: sfk my favvvvv
[8:18:29] boxxxxxxxxxxx: !title
[8:18:30] capitan_3steban: The /Mak'gora will be interesting. The duel to the death
[8:18:31] way_back: @DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea bro that happens like 1 /10000 times, if you dont play just because that that is wild lol
[8:18:31] Fossabot: Check out Mike's Instagram account - http://www.instagram.com/shroud :D
[8:18:36] GhazzyTV: SFK is a fun dungeon though
[8:18:36] boxxxxxxxxxxx: did they release news on official soon?
[8:18:37] Squee311: sfk give a massive ring from a quest
[8:18:41] Squee311: the str stam one
[8:18:41] saluu95: DUDE BUTCHERS CLEAVERRRRR SFK IS MY FAV
[8:18:43] Aauburn_: majority of people already agree with the current hardcore rules, just make it the same but official
[8:18:45] poopo_6: official hc will be on classic ye?
[8:19:00] capitan_3steban: Stay the funk AWAY from gnomeregan in HC. lol
[8:19:02] way_back: @Aauburn_ Majority of people actually dislike the new ruleset.
[8:19:02] Fossabot: Join the Shroudcord Discord, now open for everyone! discord.gg/shroud
[8:19:03] Rebos: Dungeons as long as u have the quest are good xp the 1 time
[8:19:10] NanaCanPlay: sfk is one of the coolest dungeons tho for content
[8:19:11] HotChocolate_: maybe they will  have a toggle on the official server
[8:19:14] GlykosRower: @boxxxxxxxxxxx yes. Confirmed in "late summer"
[8:19:18] fourseti1234: thats what makes the 1 life hard lol
[8:19:28] novak_back: hardcore is so much better  concept than a season of mastery concepts
[8:19:32] Winky: there is a decent middle ground to be found
[8:19:34] soupbase: aoe dungeons def sours things
[8:19:38] BoodyTV: @shroud trading/ah will be fine because if people die, those items are GONE
[8:19:38] bco71: what if you could only do dungeons once?
[8:19:38] stoik_l: i would prefer SoM2
[8:19:38] qbabattoir: mildcore wow
[8:19:40] iwillbepeyton: @shroud no auction house tho right?
[8:19:41] Winky: weve talked about it for like 4-5 months
[8:19:43] DeleteThisAccountAlready: I just want to run around with someone and killing mobs
[8:19:43] DudeNurseMan: so its only hardcore-ish ?
[8:19:43] ryegamess: f
[8:19:45] auggielole: the rules help prevent botting and gold selling
[8:19:46] mladens: !death
[8:19:47] Stealinheals: true
[8:19:48] DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea: @way_back it actually happens consistently falling off flight paths, bugged fall damages, phasing through elevators are all common in classic
[8:19:48] fourseti1234: k
[8:19:52] novak_back: for the mainstream audience, the addon rules are very hard. but just death = dead thats good enough for many people
[8:19:55] Soulfright: cant lag out
[8:20:03] BoodyTV: BASED
[8:20:08] neovim: Yo.. anyone see the fortnite star wars update ?
[8:20:10] king_tedward: HC is for people who get camped in STV by undead rogues
[8:20:12] way_back: @DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea then why are there thousands of lvl 60s on bloodsail right now that didnt have those issues?
[8:20:13] cmp3pino: truth
[8:20:13] woodsycka: I think if you can trade consumables but not gear would be fun
[8:20:13] Rebos: Spellcleave is hard? lol its mindless
[8:20:15] capitan_3steban: My HC goal will be once I get max level - I'm done. I'm not raiding, etc. lol I'm too old
[8:20:17] knowpanties: dungeon spamming doesnt make sense inregard to the rules, i think th idea is like real life, oncve something dead it can't come back
[8:20:17] GhazzyTV: Dungeon spam is ResidentSleeper no matter how effective it is, not being able to die makes dungeon spamming giga risky haha
[8:20:23] HotChocolate_: with ZERO deaths? good luck
[8:20:29] ShinyHunterSin: i died first dunegeon because group panicked
[8:20:29] Pthumeriann: ssf is not hardcore. it‚Äôs just an extra rule
[8:20:32] Bitterra: eh tons of people hit server first 60 in a few days with 0 deaths because they've been doing it on private servers for a decade now
[8:20:36] GhazzyTV: LuL
[8:20:37] jviray__: sound slike regular wow already..
[8:20:40] Stealinheals: i hope they put a 24hr lock on dungeons tho
[8:20:40] woodsycka: DRAMA
[8:20:40] novak_back: if 100k people decide they want to spend $15 a month to play hardcore for years thats money blizzard cant refuse
[8:20:41] hate_xyz: whole groups will wipe LUL
[8:20:41] aveyus: true and real
[8:20:42] DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea: @way_back plenty it has happened to and it got appealed, stop coping.
[8:20:43] saluu95: lol imagine healer oom or hunter fucks up a pull
[8:20:45] slodisgood: Esfand. KEKW
[8:20:45] TheSparkyDog: Tank disconnects from power outage seqKEK
[8:20:45] battleoverride856: friendships will be ended
[8:20:48] Winky: based
[8:20:49] fijimann: @saluu95 ya that place is brutal LUL I‚Äôve died at 18 and 19 so far, both to dumb mistakes lol
[8:20:54] soClutchItHurts: aware
[8:20:56] DudeNurseMan: so its right back to classic lol
[8:20:56] TakeThatBack: I would be more scared of trolls, like someone pulling and dcing on purpose or something lol
[8:20:59] woodsycka: POE HC with other people is fun
[8:21:00] novak_back: the only reason the addon rules exist is because the servers arent 100% hardcore, theres software characters that influence it
[8:21:01] way_back: @DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea Ive watched countless streamers grind to 60 with no appeals lmao
[8:21:07] auggielole: i like how current hardcore innately discourages gold buying and botting
[8:21:08] KevinNahmsayin: ironman in wow LUL
[8:21:09] Omnomvex: its a mmo after all
[8:21:10] Rebos: Then its just classic with 1 life? not the same mode.
[8:21:18] TheSparkyDog: @TakeThatBack That will happen. No way I would group with randoms lol
[8:21:18] novak_back: if the servers are 100% hardcore, than the rules arent really needed as much
[8:21:20] saluu95: @fijimann i cant imagine losing a 50-100 hours chara casue somone fucked up a pull
[8:21:22] hey_rooo: death 1v1s should allow victor to loot non bop items n gold
[8:21:23] Sefrog: what about BGs? should those deaths not count? BHs are hella fun
[8:21:24] DrSmellyfingerPhDiarrhea: @way_back good 4 u plenty I've seen it happen to
[8:21:24] Winky: a lot of ppl will use the addon on official as well
[8:21:26] Taydolf_Swiftler1889: What if it was like what they did in runescape, it's hardcore but in a group
[8:21:36] king_tedward: just splits the community and makes everyone burned out before vanilla fresh comes and gg
[8:21:37] FrierenHC: will official HC be ironman chat?
[8:21:37] novak_back: its gonna be exciting
[8:21:37] eza1337: i play hardcore but i am allowed to die , its my own rule @shroud
[8:21:40] woodsycka: just put a button for ssf like poe
[8:21:41] slodisgood: @Winky I think most will.
[8:21:48] novak_back: you can farm devilsaur for years
[8:21:49] ClubRetroTalks: you can party but only above or low level than you in hardcore turtle wow
[8:21:56] ClubRetroTalks: 5 levels
[8:21:56] knowpanties: i like taking away the 1 dungeon run rule though, because i hate rng
[8:22:01] Winky: we used to allow trading and bank alts back in the day
[8:22:02] RunicTitan: Idk, I feel like if some people can do X, you feel bad not doing the same. It's a disadvantage to limit yourself.
[8:22:05] DadBodHotRod: the loot sink will be nice for economy
[8:22:05] KinobiiBlack: is that water behind him?
[8:22:07] Winky: it was fine tbh
[8:22:11] novak_back: think of dungeons and dragons, DND is hardcore right? you get one life
[8:22:12] imm00rtalx: @shroud shouldnt be seperated, dont divide the game more than it alrdy is. If someone doesnt like it the way blizzard does it, theyre free to not play
[8:22:18] SparklyRug: you can still play by your own rules
[8:22:19] novak_back: hardcore is the ultimate fantasy game
[8:22:21] boogie303: this is retail not classic right?
[8:22:21] SparklyRug: no one is stopping you
[8:22:28] Insanespyda: i think allowing multiple dungeon runs to complete the quest and then prevent people from running it after that is fine
[8:22:32] intimewatch: you are still de best streamer greetz from belgium !
[8:22:32] daPsyche: thought on the duel til death mechanic
[8:22:41] Winky: ultimately we didnt stop trading and mail and bank alts etc because of the spirit of the challenge, we stopped it because it was impossible to track
[8:22:42] capitan_3steban: Jumpin' in Orgrim - truly the Vanilla xp.
[8:22:50] novak_back: imagine seeing a player walking around in gear you crafted on a character that died weeks ago
[8:22:51] FrierenHC: will boosintg be in HC?
[8:22:53] Winky: half the rules only exist because we needed something trackable for verification
[8:22:55] Smoogol: Aware
[8:22:59] way_back: People that want to play with a bunch of rules why dont they just do that? Blizzard isnt stopping you from pplaying a melee hunter
[8:23:00] 4rson: positive attitude is 99% of hardcore fun
[8:23:04] capitan_3steban: No boosting. lol what would be the point. lol
[8:23:08] hate_xyz: they will probably have achievements too like the mod has
[8:23:15] capitan_3steban: But it's blizz,. so we'll see
[8:23:17] BoodyTV: true and real
[8:23:19] jloof94: the one rule i want to see carry over is running a dungeon only once
[8:23:20] BoodyTV: based take ty shroud
[8:23:21] novak_back: itll be niche for sure, but if even 100k players decice they want to do stay subscribed, its 1.5m a month in revenue blizz cant say no
[8:23:22] digitalpanhandlr: dont think there will be griefing on hardcore official with that battle to the death /mokgora or whatever...
[8:23:22] elnovi: CAPTAIN

[8:23:29] lemorte37: Thats what I like about you man. Not stubbornly stuck on an idea. Love to see it
[8:23:30] BoodyTV: if boosters die, they die
[8:23:30] king_tedward: ive spoken to a few boosters on era and they all said boosting is easily doable on HC
[8:23:30] Trogbad: rune of the guard captain
[8:23:31] saluu95: i got that trinket that was fucking being farmed to shit...
[8:23:34] Honeycrispie: Yea there's far too many silly rules w/ hc addon currently. excited to have some of that go away.
[8:23:36] TheSparkyDog: But you can do that on non-hardcore too. I dont understand why that is a draw lol
[8:23:37] knowpanties: im gunna boost
[8:23:41] boogie303: its so weird how empty orgrimmar is in retail, when you remember it from Burning Crusade times, and it made your PC crash because it was so crowded
[8:23:43] studshift: daily lockout would be ideal imo
[8:23:45] DrCrusherOohLaLa: stocks boosting services
[8:23:47] siegreh: I thought you could still boost in wotlk?
[8:23:55] bottis96: Will people that have a 60 already move to another server and start over?
[8:23:55] Rebos: Cant wait to sell hardcore boosts
[8:23:56] ClubRetroTalks: turtle wow already doing what blizzard gonna do with hardcore, you also get reward if you reach 60 and become immortal.
[8:23:57] 4rson: im gonna buy the blizzard $70 hardcore character boost it's an 800% value
[8:24:11] way_back: @boogie303 Org isnt the main city anymore dude lol
[8:24:12] novak_back: if blizzard is tough on griefers and tough on bots, itll be good.
[8:24:13] capitan_3steban: all the whale HC boosters - WoW will make a fortune. LUL
[8:24:16] Winky: lemme know if you ever wanna get on voice and talk about this stuff, theres a ton of potential

[8:24:41] R0CKETMVN: all devs do that and it makes me sick. COD, EFT, WoW all of em LUL
[8:24:44] Dunk305: boosters ruin the entire point of half of the game
[8:24:45] XshadowturkeyX: just add Dun geon finder at that poitn instead of bringign bossing back
[8:24:46] xithus: wotlk has been exhausting with how its been treated
[8:24:48] king_tedward: you cant stop boosting
[8:24:49] Winky: gordan is a god
[8:24:51] RAGINGELEMENTAL: I miss boosting the time commitment to play another class is way too much
[8:24:53] king_tedward: theres too many ways to do it
[8:24:56] atherling: gordon ramsey? Pog
[8:24:57] j0kezon: be a leader
[8:24:58] Winky: you couldve rolled through, we had tons of homies there
[8:24:59] GlykosRower: @clubretrotalks becoming immortal at 60 sounds lame. What's the point of going 60 HC if you can't try end game shit as hardcore ?

[8:25:25] lbaboon: o7
[8:25:29] SpaceCowboy0811: I think the more you show your face repping wow the better it is for the game

[8:30:33] legulasrs: you can afk a lot of things in osrs tho
[8:30:37] backstabbandit: @sno_static tons of new ones every day
[8:30:39] Ban_ned: true alot of it is afkable
[8:30:42] veiloflonelystars: @novak1802 hc hits that spot pretty well, love it. i also like retail but thats more of a pure gameplay game on high endp ve
[8:30:42] saluu95: not the quests nor boss grinds
[8:30:43] Ban_ned: if you choose that method
[8:30:45] Bakardee: Bakardee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[8:31:01] braisertv: @shroud Have you looked at the new game Called Ethyrial : Echoes of Yore
[8:31:01] saluu95: @saluu95 yeah but needs to be really expensive
[8:31:06] Scrazeloppe: to grind it out
[8:31:07] DemureGuy: Yeppp
[8:31:09] Winky: people love games that you tap a screen until your hands break
[8:31:10] BoodyTV: @shroud my friend plays mmos and osrs on side monitor
[8:31:13] Honeycrispie: indeed
[8:31:13] wJayto: afk in osrs is weird. cus its not exactly afk, its like click every few minutes or less
[8:31:14] zymper_xd: feels like a chore
[8:31:15] 0nelonepanda: ive got a 2100 ironman on osrs, the grind is real and played mostly while studying in college. Very afk at time
[8:31:15] Winky: OSRS figured it out yea lol
[8:31:16] StrizFPS: he's basically travelling from washington to south america LUL but his flight is no faster than a train
[8:31:16] saluu95: cause the presteige of the skills remains the same

[8:31:20] Teelure: i like the quests i don't level

[8:31:21] Samstarox: ?? is he cooking?

[8:31:28] saluu95: ew rs3 is poo
[8:31:30] NaturalHighX: spend real money to not play games**
[8:31:34] LCTR_: afk feels like cheating to ppl, there's a thrill in progressing without playing for some
[8:31:36] DadBodHotRod: the skills are afkable but endgame content is very enjoyable and fairly difficult
[8:31:37] DemureGuy: Truly!!!
[8:31:37] legulasrs: the combat and bossing is very fun on rs3
[8:31:39] Samstarox: don't devalue my max cape
[8:31:40] FrierenHC: but anime girls in runescape and it's the new best game
[8:31:43] BangerzOnly: forsen
[8:31:45] gygaxx69: the afk stuff allows you to do the fun stuff
[8:31:46] SaidTheReaper: Make an Ironman RS3 account - no trading all self funded and built from drops
[8:31:47] gojiburr: rs3 is great
[8:31:48] HamiltonPvP: just a disgusting grind @shroud
[8:31:48] bcarter1992: haha im sitting at the g.e rn just lvling up herblore hahaha
[8:31:51] Ban_ned: alot of skills in OSRS arent ever used, its just stat stick for quests and achievement requirements.
[8:31:54] mike_oxfury: cuss you can chill and watch streams
[8:31:55] Arkson: you can play it while doing boring life chores or whatever and it makes it less boring
[8:31:58] Hi0p: I feel that‚Äôs why the osrs mobile move was as smooth as it was. The games meant for it üòÄ
[8:31:58] novak_back: @veiloflonelystars yeah HC is a perfect compromise because in softcore you always plateau

[8:36:24] rickofgod: Retail wow is bad. This right here is what wow is
[8:36:37] novak_back: @1234Kaizen honestly the only "fun" part of wow is just knowing a ton about the game..
[8:36:43] hirath1: are the official hardcore servers going to be pvp?
[8:36:44] Protomateria: @rickofgod theyre both fun for different reasons. no need to hate on one or the other

[8:37:10] DealerMDL: easy 50s
[8:37:12] StarlightNebula_: @LATCH365 Currently HC is done by the community through an addon, these servers would have set rules implemented by blizzard. They haven't given any details tho
[8:37:18] ArrogantOutlaw: @LATCH365 you cant die or you have to delete character.
[8:37:18] mattyd2132: its not a lot but its honest work

[9:08:24] jacethejouster: Undercity best city
[9:08:27] SynSeed: its like a wave imo, sometimes gamers want hard then easy then all over again
[9:08:28] Smoogol: NPCs be like Madgeclap "maybe check behind the wall for a hidden button or something"

[9:09:56] capitan_3steban: Oh god
[9:09:56] Protomateria: @marbsgaming extremely worth. game could be $100 and still be worth
[9:09:56] OzginReborn: I know UC elevator will be how I die
[9:09:56] VoylRL: KEKW

[9:10:15] kahel: !duo
[9:10:15] Fossabot: @kahel, He's playing with Tyler "skadoodle"
[9:10:19] VoylRL: its a chain though?
[9:10:24] rickofgod: Elden ring is the best game to come out in the last 5 years
[9:10:25] SynSeed: are there any benefits for troll shaman?
[9:10:31] jakequarters: My streamer
[9:10:46] GaktuS: @SynSeed yes troll racials are pretty good
[9:10:57] capitan_3steban: Elden Ring is fun if you're a gamer -if you're a noob you're going to have a bad time
[9:11:00] Blazin2142: self lust
[9:11:03] Blazin2142: for troll
[9:11:14] Leisure_Suit_Larry: Level doesn't matter
[9:11:23] Toastedclouds_: @capitan_3steban Im a turbo noob and I  had fun in elden ring. Just gotta have willpower lmao
[9:11:26] novak_back: the fact that elden ring is $60 is mindblowing
[9:11:28] SynSeed: @gaktus cool, I just dont want no tauren
[9:11:34] novak_back: accounting for inflation anyway
[9:11:34] STARB0Y43: Shroud have you ever play Metin2 before? nadiaa1PradaWiggle nadiaa1PradaWiggle
[9:11:37] capitan_3steban: Perhaps you're right
[9:11:44] flyzen19: this world looks empty
[9:11:53] rickofgod: Elden ring set a standard that no other companies have lived up to
[9:11:59] GaktuS: @SynSeed troll shaman is a classic choice, its a good pick :)
[9:12:19] hampyboi: The shroud
[9:12:25] imm00rtalx: @shroud The prominent issue with retail handholding is primarily the complexity and too many systems for anyone new to actually get into it. The only way they could ever remove is by a total reset of game or WoW 2. I cant imagine how hard it must be for a new player. Most of it isnt overcomplicated by its own but when it all adds up it has the perseption as such.
[9:12:30] SavyYT: when is the riot mmo coming out?
[9:12:30] capitan_3steban: elden ring is 'worth" more than every single game that came out last year and this. So yeah buy it bto
[9:12:37] LCTR_: D:
[9:12:39] Protomateria: @novak1802 yeah, the fact that games have been $60 for 20+ years is mindblowing in general. also why i find it funny when people complain about games being $70 now
[9:12:41] CodemanLUL: @shroud Do you remember us meeting at ESL in Germany back in 2017? I had my picture taken with you
[9:12:52] xErrorKx: Hello
[9:12:54] HotChocolate_: monkaW
[9:13:06] aitons_: @CodemanLUL what makes you think that you're the only one that he took a photo with?
[9:13:16] rickofgod: But that's also why hc classic has surged. It's not easy
[9:13:17] capitan_3steban: ghostcrawler left that riot MMO,. has me concerned,...
[9:13:22] actuallyrealuke: monkaW
[9:13:24] Danny__L: forge is at the farm
[9:13:38] marbsgaming: how many hour to finish elden ring
[9:13:41] digitalpanhandlr: ya he has to go to the alliance farm  and kill the mobs to use forge
[9:13:44] bdollhawley: Hey chat is this his first toon?
[9:13:45] capitan_3steban: classic hd surged 'cause it's something to do before d4 drops. lol
[9:13:53] capitan_3steban: d4 will be the game of the summer,. we all know it
[9:13:59] novak_back: @Protomateria its something people dont realize and its somethign i worry about. raising the price is a last resort, usually companies gut the quality first. and then eventually they raise the price but its still gutted
[9:14:04] bloodborne60fpsplz: I played 100 hours of elden ring the first 6 days lol
[9:14:12] Pampitas: !server
[9:14:12] Fossabot: @Pampitas, The DayZ server has been taken offline while Grey Man 2.0 is being worked on in the background. Keep an eye out for more!
[9:14:14] KontrolStyle: there's a forge in horde area too, little bit away from the houses
[9:14:20] CodemanLUL: @femboyeh i had him sign my chest
[9:14:22] HardlyCamping: Shrood likes turdles
[9:14:23] knowpanties: zelda will be game of the summer
[9:14:25] West1y_Pipes: Can you reincarn in HC?
[9:14:25] rickofgod: A game doesnt have to be pretty and polished to be fun
[9:14:29] Saucinn: that quest is terrible
[9:14:30] TheMcBoom: oh this quest sucks
[9:14:31] aitons_: @CodemanLUL oh,
[9:14:31] jambytv: watch out for the southshore guards my guy
[9:14:38] Saucinn: I skipped this on my shaman
[9:14:43] TheMcBoom: its a white item from the turtles
[9:14:45] novak_back: game companies kept up with inflation with battlepasses and microtransactions but i miss the days when i got what i paid for
[9:14:56] capitan_3steban: Skyrim was fun as hell and it was a bug filled wreck of a game. I still love it tho. lol
[9:15:01] novak_back: tho its hard to ask a consumer to pay $100+ for a game today
[9:15:02] GaktuS: monkaW
[9:15:07] KevinNahmsayin: "Soothing Turtle Bisque:"
[9:15:10] tehtehcre: u need corpsemaker man

[9:15:26] rickofgod: Skyrim is an almost perfect game
[9:15:27] TheMcBoom: not bisket lmao
[9:15:34] OzginReborn: I switched to dagger + shield with flametongue for these turtles, crazy high armor
[9:15:35] 8lue4: Greyman FAILED?:(
[9:15:40] digitalpanhandlr: best to farm it in shimmering flats
[9:15:44] bloodborne60fpsplz: skyrims combat blows
[9:15:46] Greenery14: Biscuit sounds better xD
[9:15:52] Nosni_tv: You can loot the meat in 1k needles too later for the turtle quest there
[9:16:00] HotChocolate_: far sight  it?
[9:16:06] rickofgod: Skyrims lore and story is top notch
[9:16:06] capitan_3steban: Skyrims combat was great 12 years ago
[9:16:10] BeamedR: are you going to play the new update of V rising this week? @shroud
[9:16:16] digitalpanhandlr: @shroud best to farm the turtle meat in shimmering flats... lots of turtles, fast respawn
[9:16:26] HotChocolate_: oh sry i thought the forge was still a mystery
[9:16:27] Gummybunnn: gonna take forever for 2 people to farm that turtle meat
[9:16:28] A7m444d: !hc
[9:16:28] Fossabot: @A7m444d here are the rules for Hardcore https://classichc.net/rules/
[9:16:41] Squee311: you dont need cooking but you need it to use the recipe
[9:16:44] imm00rtalx: @shroud The guide tells u to buy the soothing spice in UC and train cooking
[9:16:49] Evilnside: nah you don't have to. You just don't learn the recipe
[9:17:02] Protomateria: @novak1802 yeah that might be true, but idk. i feel like games have kinda been going downhill since covid
[9:17:13] Saucinn: that quest is terrible it can take forever
[9:17:21] sad0____: there is more of them near the lake of Alterac mountains
[9:17:22] KribzCC: yep
[9:17:23] capitan_3steban: Ray-ban sunglasses ad talking about "living your truth",...  - isn't there just the truth not "your truth"?
[9:17:33] Lawblades: skyrim's combat always sucked ass. it's just the first morrowind style game with good enough graphics to feel somewhat realistic for casuals that like to immerse
[9:17:35] kahrazy: there's a shimmering flats quest that has you kill turtles as well
[9:17:41] capitan_3steban: i hate ads. lol
[9:17:41] rickofgod: Let's talk about Redfall...one of 2023s supposed best releases and it was an absolute trash can fire
[9:17:55] Novchok: the biggest schlong in the Horde, Shroud
[9:18:03] Danny__L: that's not true
[9:18:08] Stanlec: not true
[9:18:12] YourBadgerr: @Novchok HUHH
[9:18:26] Macrel: ive seen people sell the meat so it isnt tied to the quest
[9:18:26] capitan_3steban: Redfall, another Covid 19 victim.
[9:18:37] Unbound_Entity: its a cooking ingredient, not a quest item.
[9:18:46] Fr0nti3r: nah trutle meat drops from turtles of sufficent level
[9:18:52] Fossabot: Follow Mike on Twitter https://twitter.com/shroud
[9:19:00] Danny__L: the quest does require cooking yes, but the item is not quest exclusive
[9:19:05] novak_back: @Protomateria theres so many factors honestly. games will always be an art and you cant create art without love
[9:19:05] JOOOOEEEEY: still going to use HC addon on official servers
[9:19:06] capitan_3steban: the turtles have a quest,. yeah this quest takes forever sometimes,.
[9:19:10] iLackskillsss: i hope they're strict in official hc servers
