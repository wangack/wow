[1:46:40] CMack_72: I am not an astronaut but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.
[1:46:47] Cyclotol: Would theoretically work, but would have to be HUGE which would take constructing in space, and at the moment, not worth the cost or time.
[1:46:57] mkbrawinput: the force has to pull down , since our bones are made for compresion not any g force
[1:46:57] fuuzofc: im an asstronaut
[1:47:05] mclett: I think how they did it in interstellar is technically possible
[1:47:08] piratechris: If the ship is spinning you don't have gravity but centrifugal force
[1:47:10] mystyee: That is what holds you on the rightl  g firces
[1:47:26] Leer0ygreen: The iss is not really without gravity, it ‚Äûfalls‚Äú around the earth.

[1:49:55] velathore: its basically that rusty thing at the carnival that spins.
[1:49:57] Timberbay: By using centrifugal force we can generate something equivalent to gravity on Earth. One possible way of creating artificial gravity in space is by utilizing a technology called an O'Neill cylinder. -google
[1:49:58] Seidrrr: It is actually already made into a plan for ISS in 2011. It's nothing more than centrifugal effect caused by the centripetal force which pushes the person on the floor. It's the most realistic artificial gravity there is.
[1:50:14] Rohafin: what you going to main :o no warrior no paladin :O
[1:50:36] Leer0ygreen: Think of it like this, if that wheel is spinning, what will force you down to it??
