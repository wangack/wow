[0:29:21] probeu: duels
[0:29:22] bamfosaurus: or did just bdgg dissolve?
[0:29:30] dknamey: just play dh and train healers youll get 1800 LUL
[0:29:32] inspect4: @dewblus learning "pvp" in stv is not gonna happen bro
[0:29:33] Tovone: whaazz and raiku goat's EZ
[0:29:33] fridxa: Bg is easier
[0:29:34] Aludyx: Xar, since wow has been re-releasing Classic wow's TBC,wratch,cata, changing and improving them as they go, What would you thoughts be on if WoD came out if it got to that point? Would you change or improve anything? @Xaryu
[0:29:43] whitedevil253: now it is your time to shine , leets play some AWC
[0:29:45] cory_lockman: @watchmetrapx trading Jelly for Xar I think. Jelly got mad at his teammates so they cut him
[0:29:46] Cross86: Morning xar
[0:30:03] daschadwick: morning chat morning xarbo
[0:30:18] kharma99: STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW WE HERE
[0:30:21] The_Stinky_Pete: goldshire duels >>>>>
[0:30:22] fetza108: imganixe xar in the "The Move"
[0:30:31] WildeThornberry: I’d be absolutely shocked if Xar joined The Move but it would be one of the dopest things ever
[0:30:31] DoYouSeeOk: is does just go to elwynn forest
[0:30:35] Smoothiez_: He's kinda right. I did the most pvp learning in cata/mop when dueling outside SW was so common
[0:30:36] TheFernandeez: theres no one outside orgrimmar nor stormwind
[0:30:38] DoYouSeeOk: elwynn forest just duelers
[0:30:40] Anarchiezx: Anarchiezx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:30:42] firepoooop: gooodmorning xardooder !!
[0:30:45] probeu: oh you want to duel? hold up let me swap to tank
[0:30:46] fridxa: I play pvp all the time, didnt duel for like years
[0:30:47] TheMercDeadpool: I agree. Duels aren't fun, they're more like rock paper scissors
[0:30:48] limburgse: alot of duels happen in Valdrakken
[0:30:56] WildeThornberry: Anyone know if Mage is any good in retail?
[0:31:06] DoYouSeeOk: @limburgse durotar gates and goldshire for allaince always duelers
[0:31:26] carrvve: sure talked me into it.
[0:31:26] unluckyjoyjoy: hello there everyone
[0:31:29] ligmalolkekw: duels happen in Valdrakken while DPS is waiting for hour long Solo Shuffle Q's @Xaryu
[0:31:31] gen1e: true
[0:31:31] TokerTy420: most duelers will roll someone with zero pvp skill lol
[0:31:32] cory_lockman: @WildeThornberry mage whooped a lobby in solo shuffle last night (2k mmr) he 6-0 the lobby. He was arcane and played very well
[0:31:33] ahlk: @WildeThornberry Mages are great in Dragonflight
[0:31:36] fridxa: You can 1v1 in bgs tho @xaryu
[0:31:39] Minifoo1: How do I join your guild on SF HC?
[0:31:41] Ereborwow: mop dueling was so cool
[0:31:41] Dewblus: thank you man @xaryu
[0:31:55] Kazunya_Meowryu: You got some great clips in the redditt today xar haha
[0:31:56] Aludyx: Another thing, Layers are pointless at this point. They were only good at the launch of Expan
[0:31:57] Gokublue001: meta for 1s, 2s, and 3s are so different seems like waste of time when I have to relearn again
[0:32:00] WildeThornberry: @cory_lockman so time for Xar to make a comeback
[0:32:02] jvizzey: i don't think anyone wants to watch HC anymore
[0:32:03] lilplatotv: @WildeThornberry Its kinda down right now, but is generally good so  a good pick for a main. Arcane is the meta right now
[0:32:04] Neowynd: 1v1 arena Q could help
[0:32:10] ddevillax: i made a ton of gold healing for gdkp's on my priest and now i have so little gold i cant even afford my mount
[0:32:14] auuzib: Pandoras box finally?!?!?
[0:32:15] cory_lockman: @WildeThornberry i hope xar goes back to retail haha
[0:32:15] Smoothiez_: dueling is massive for learning how to counterplay certain classes.
[0:32:16] AustFisch: do you think SoD pvp is goofy because its so unbalanced? I been grinding rep and it has been abysmal with all the 1-2 shots
[0:32:21] HelluvaWrecks: dueling is a basic starting point with a very high ceiling
[0:32:24] woad_: I love watching HC
[0:32:25] macjcool: HC is boring AF, sorry about it
[0:32:25] surchristoph: !ASSASSIN CHALLENGE
[0:32:26] fetza108: i like watching hc but not playing KEKW
[0:32:26] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER

[0:32:42] kharma99: SoD is true wow killer
[0:32:44] hobosam87: servers for HC seem busy
[0:32:47] inspect4: I dont see anyone playing or streaming hc
[0:32:47] IAmLubes: hi xaryu have a great stream!
[0:32:49] srsdfg: watching HC is great, playing it casually is CBA
[0:32:49] chibisamuraifox: @xaryu have you noticed that for both raids in season of discovery it seems like the second to last bosses have been the most difficult boss
[0:32:49] MrCharles_12: MrCharles_12 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! 
[0:32:52] SLAMMMY: HC streams are the best
[0:32:53] fridxa: @neowynd you can't balance 1v1, 2s isn't balanced
[0:32:54] nicostance: HC is not about russhing
[0:32:55] Erbsosa: hardcore or ssf?
[0:32:55] WildeThornberry: HC was cool but SoD is more fun to watch
[0:32:58] surchristoph: HC HYPE

[0:34:47] ddevillax: can SF and non-SF players group up?
[0:34:48] williwhite94: cheating ur self only LOL
[0:34:57] fridxa: People boost so they can sell the accounts
[0:34:57] PirateWibber: @ddevillax yes
[0:35:02] Hood______: I think the idea is that the challenge is imposed
[0:35:06] khaste_G: hi xar :)
[0:35:08] icadillchips: How do you feel about mages in pvp in sod
[0:35:08] Smoothiez_: @ddevillax yeah, thats what boosting is
[0:35:11] probeu: SF players with their second account 60 auto following them ICANT
[0:35:12] Cross86: @ddevillax ha rip Bozo LUL
[0:35:18] macjcool: that coding would be insane
[0:35:21] Gokublue001: without gdkp and boosting i will just play retial lol
[0:35:21] avalaok: The game should feel like a challenge so it's only to their disadvantage
[0:35:27] Knocktoff: could cause some trolling though
[0:35:29] Travnar: @Xaryu healers BTFO
[0:35:29] RickPhilip: @macjcool Not really
[0:35:30] fridxa: Boosting is for selling your account to other people
[0:35:30] ahlk: People would grief XP
[0:35:32] benjocre4m: im am and its pretty ez
[0:35:33] Awlibya: I think people care about it cause they want the bragging rights of getting to 60 on their own, but other people getting boosted/helped there diminishes it for them.

[1:45:22] Jubilation12: @niigghtmare34 players ≠ quality lmao
[1:45:25] Kettopossum: Bro I feel robber ngl. There was no reason to replace OW1, what a scam Madge
[1:45:25] bushthebug: you can get the new heroes for free but it takes a while and its a disadvantage because swapping picks to counter is a HUGE part of the game
[1:45:27] Muckbot1: This hurts
[1:45:29] DucktorLarsen: 50% of OW2 was supposed to be that PvE part and the fully scrapped it.

[1:46:01] Jubilation12: @niigghtmare34 um no its not tf LULW. player count does not make a game good. just look at COD
[1:46:06] RaizenHQ: as an OW fan...I had to uninstall the game its just garbage now
[1:46:09] bigwilly3737: @niigghtmare34 the game is trash who cares if its optional shouldve never been an option
[1:46:11] niigghtmare34: people that have never played overwatch are quick to talk shit about it
[1:46:16] ocdocdocdocd: People are not smart to buy D4

[1:46:31] DOPBOP_: LUL
[1:46:43] MKDarker: no endgame.
[1:46:50] hearthledgerlol: No leaderboards, itemization is awful and has to get overhauled, no endgame, no offline mode, game is shit.
[1:46:50] niigghtmare34: @Jubilation12 yeah more people play it because its worse.....make it make sense
[1:46:54] EmilTuT: @raizenhq i would need to be paid to play it

[1:47:22] JamesIRL: does that make the game too easy tho
[1:47:23] rasgrulz: nerf strong classes to make the game like retail arenas where u need dappening
[1:47:25] grecko_: ffxiv devs do it like that

[1:47:31] Martylang: yea no cause the content was already a joke

[1:47:35] niigghtmare34: @Jubilation12 when you lose a debate you revert to insults, grats
[1:47:36] RaizenHQ: @EmilTuT FR . OW2 is just a tilt fest...not fun at all
[1:47:36] Choomba: it also requires more work, which is why many devs don't do it

[1:49:57] MKDarker: it's a lot of psychology budget put in
[1:49:59] caravainilla: Classic wow saved blizzard for the moment.
[1:50:00] ReallyThough: blizzard died awhile back guys lets be honest but its at least entertaining
[1:50:04] ze_puncho: every storm dies out eventually
[1:50:04] ashraf_ma: 2023 was a good year for wow retail & classic , the future looks good too @Xaryu
[1:50:07] Jubilation12: @niigghtmare34 because OW2 is a product of just scumbag methods that nobody likes. people that arent complacent hate OW2

[1:50:21] mfwillie: yo that haircut fire
[1:50:21] christiangodwarrior97: blizzard is doing incredibly well whether u like it or not
[1:50:22] inspect4: hc was giga niche community
[1:50:24] Acework: @rasgrulz your mom
[1:50:25] TrumpWallWorker: because those are niche vs new game releases
[1:50:26] Auslanderrr: copium
[1:50:27] ymithh: WoW has been great past few months
[1:50:29] rabyez: Well made video but to be fair it didnt talk about classic or diablo 2 remaster which is pretty good
[1:50:29] avo_9: Classic wow is carrying blizzard
[1:50:29] migliqt: keep splitting the community with 50 different versions of wow instead of focusing on 1 good game, well played
[1:50:30] love_eggplant: 1 team that does a w vs 100 fails?
[1:50:30] Martylang: theres a lkot he missed also starcraft stuff  but its an ok video
[1:50:30] niigghtmare34: @bigwilly3737 how do you think companies stay open? giving shit away for free
[1:50:30] Jubilation12: @niigghtmare34 aint no way u dont work at blizzard
[1:50:33] daerbgge: COPIUM holy
[1:50:34] orrifez: bow before he who has no life
[1:50:34] Bogla: @niigghtmare34 scummy monetization and followed through on 0 promises and i liked ow1 but idk how u can defend that
[1:50:34] Kazunya_Meowryu: @niigghtmare34 you know pharma is even worse, should we make people play their life savings to live just because "they have to make money"??
[1:50:35] EmilTuT: haircut goes hard
[1:50:36] myahkaho: people only focus on the negative
[1:50:38] ahlk: WoW is in a better place now than in the past several years
[1:50:40] SodaBannedMe: @Eminim97 nah man lmao. wokring from home is so good for tech jobs esp when blizz is in irvine
[1:50:40] 0Phantazy: @Xaryu With HC and SoD they pretty much just copied ideas already in play..
[1:50:42] shapebender: SOD and Hardcore, player dependent ... you like it but alot don't
[1:50:43] chickodie: ITS CALLED SOD FOR A REASON, IF IT GROWS IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL GREEN GARDEN
[1:50:44] MattOriginal: Dragonflight has been a big W as well
[1:50:44] rasgrulz: @Acework when u have no argument u attack people personally.
[1:50:45] SuperSkunkFunk: thats just a fraction of bliz tho tbh
[1:50:46] RaizenHQ: you can tell Blizz is prioritizing WoW tho only. Everything else in in maintenance mode
[1:50:48] ShingaTV: @rasgrulz better then the last 8 years work^^
[1:50:49] asloff: @christiangodwarrior97 interesting take my guy....
[1:50:49] MKDarker: u cant generalize everything. There are different departments, different games etc. marketing, devs, CEOs, stakeholders.
[1:50:51] windatar: WoW is literally the only positive out of Blizzard in the last 10 years besides diablo 2 remaster.
[1:50:51] drewbuckler: True
[1:50:51] heygoditsme: yeahh
[1:50:52] Fjurry99: $150ish dollars a year for SOD, worth it?
[1:50:54] Plokoon100: They are divided
[1:50:56] jo0cke: The heart is in the money and not the games.
[1:50:59] Acework: @rasgrulz whats your argument king
[1:50:59] Metaphix: way too many
[1:51:03] Qeevdo: And how raid lockouts work in both retail and classic buttsoMadge
[1:51:06] ReconMazihoFanda: horrible company, even SoD is not good so far, we need proper classic+ with new content, not reworks
[1:51:07] betterthyself: impossible to please everyone, the hate in trade chat shot around between standard HC and SF right now..ugh xD
[1:51:09] banshay3: SOD is so much fun
[1:51:09] rasgrulz: @Acework it went over ur head buddy. LUL
[1:51:09] tellmeagainiforgot: @christiangodwarrior97 profit wise sure
[1:51:10] bigwilly3737: @niigghtmare34 no by releasing a good game that ppl want to play not releasing battlepasses and a reskin of a game with no changes lol overwatch2 isnt different at all but battlepasses
[1:51:15] jbeemerks: this video sucks.  most negative click bait ever.  everyone know what sucks it’s super obvious
[1:51:15] Acework: @rasgrulz you stated it like a fact loser
[1:51:18] joenewall: generally though, hes talking about blizzard in general. Blizzard is on the downswing for sure. WoW isnt the majority of BLIZZARDS playerbase. I wonder what percentage it is.
[1:51:18] weil6: Classic Era too
[1:51:19] Kisotope_: but we need HC BC LUL
[1:51:20] wavecadet: true
[1:51:21] brakealot: I think if we pay sub every month we should get the games for free
[1:51:22] Reaperz_kinetic: @christiangodwarrior97 no theyre not KEKW
[1:51:25] Martylang: @windatar  the starcraft remaster was also very good
[1:51:26] Tuppin: profits > fun needs to change
[1:51:26] The_Farting_Spaniard: Did it to themselves
[1:51:26] optional_advice: @Xaryu why did you pause the video at this point lmfao
[1:51:26] Jubilation12: @reconmazihofanda fr hope they give us actual new stuff
[1:51:28] Kistler: I agree, but they created the problem :\
[1:51:29] rasgrulz: @Acework there u go again defending daddy blizzard LUL
[1:51:39] jbeemerks: L video.
[1:51:41] christiangodwarrior97: @Reaperz_kinetic they are tho doesnt matter if u hate them or not xd
[1:51:42] nxdRn: so many things and no talent to build all that LUL
[1:51:43] asloff: @jbeemerks dude was just laying out facts... he was pretty objective
[1:51:44] ZebraBacon: a team for each.. not hard.. they just cheap
[1:51:53] somadaz: dead is dead
[1:51:54] daerbgge: i mean hardcore was never alive. was streamer driven content

[1:51:58] Faddermukker: That guy on screen died, right?
[1:52:01] rasgrulz: wrath is 100% dead
[1:52:02] niigghtmare34: everything is dead but people are still playing
[1:52:08] baxxter24: its there own fault tho, they havnt created new games and keep reusing old ones, and in turn create subdivisions in those games
[1:52:08] jbeemerks: @asloff maybe but it’s boring.
[1:52:08] Reaperz_kinetic: @christiangodwarrior97 theyre literally not tho KEKW please if theyre doing so great explain how
[1:52:10] EmilTuT: his hair looks like the thiefs hair from home alone after his hat sets on fire
[1:52:11] Acework: @rasgrulz huh? i deffend sod as the only thing good from blizzard in the past 10 years
[1:52:18] MKDarker: for example devs can only do what their chefs are giving them to do
[1:52:19] myahkaho: stv
[1:52:21] shapebender: if blizz put the resources into developing retail instead of 5 versions of wow, they could fix balancing issues AND patches AND expansions instead of just developing expansions

[1:56:49] zernez_tv: wait Whaazz didnt play?
[1:56:50] stroobzbeats: Lontar had no mana, just stood there watching
[1:56:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @christiangodwarrior97 you still havent showed any results KEKW
[1:56:55] daerbgge: so he died cause lontar had no mana?
[1:56:56] Neezai: @evolutionslayerz it is, but imagine if it had full focus
[1:56:56] Acework: @giantgreendoor hey man, compared to other esports it really is insignificant sorry to say
[1:56:59] heygoditsme: @itsmistero idk about professional wow but league pros can get sued for that :D
[1:57:03] hutchyy917: imagine benching whaaz

[1:57:11] Snerks: the 3v2 was so long
[1:57:18] christiangodwarrior97: trill goated
[1:57:20] snowhush: Trill didn't blink, he just saw red and kept going. It was amazing.
[1:57:20] shapebender: Raiku was almost full life when Trill took him out also lol
[1:57:22] Reaperz_kinetic: @christiangodwarrior97 their results as of late have been awful every single time
[1:57:23] Fnafson: its a rogue moment
[1:57:23] Ervill1: Raiku died only because of ping
[1:57:23] inspect4: 50% dampening

[1:57:24] realayblinkin: Xar you converted me to the stream world, never been on twitch before
[1:57:25] stroobzbeats: Echo probably had a moment of celebration that got them off their game for that last moment
[1:57:26] alexgoat94: have you seen ziqos video on the raid issues in SOD?
[1:57:26] daerbgge: no mana = lose
[1:57:26] Neezai: @ech0cide that’s fair.
[1:57:26] theam_13: shit was insane
[1:57:27] mstr_shake: trill cloaks the fear to kill raiku
[1:57:30] lujohnson1989: can we see the chair punch again
[1:57:31] Haematopodidae: cdew is crazy
[1:57:31] Bogla: trill was doing like 150k dps in one of those games or something lol
[1:57:33] Neezai: xaryu - blizzard should never have launched classic, its just adding more branches to what you just explained.. and we have been there and done the content its just a repeat of the ‘glory’ days when instead they should have focused on retail content and making that better
[1:57:34] 1nightplays: what were u doing when u missed it
[1:57:35] giantgreendoor: @Acework It's an mmorpg, its not compareable to other esports. but saying its no body is completely wrong
[1:57:36] zerozuckerl: why is it only CDEW props
[1:57:38] Knocktoff: ty!
[1:57:39] MoneyKrusher1: @hutchyy917 IF WAAAAZ WOULD HAVE PLAYED THEY WOULD HAVE LOST
[1:57:40] lilplatotv: I was shitting myself watching it live
[1:57:41] CeeTeeM: That chair punch was EPIC
[1:57:44] SodaBannedMe: On another note, XAR joining the move inc??
[1:57:46] frozeusgaming: Echo did the same to them in the finals 2vs3 come back
[1:57:46] ZebraBacon: roll back that chair punch
[1:57:49] snowhush: Cdew's evoker plays yesterday were amazing.
[1:57:51] theam_13: yeah chan confirmed that
[1:57:54] ashraf_ma: Watch the pika clip @Xaryu you missed one

[1:58:10] Reaperz_kinetic: @christiangodwarrior97 you still havent said what theyve done great with
[1:58:11] Xzanelol: L8q@moneykrusher1 would you rather win 1 game or win the tournament?
[1:58:11] Cenarios13: Pepega take
[1:58:15] totezmcgoatz_: the demand for vanilla was already there in private servers
[1:58:15] rahien_: no way, if classic isnt a thing i wouldnt even play
[1:58:16] ama__deus: The people who play classic don't play Retail and wouldn't if there wasn't Classic
[1:58:17] dirk_mcgurk: playerbase infinitely splintered. cat out of the bag
[1:58:18] Heart_tv: Didnt classic revive the game? lol
[1:58:18] tdbeach1985: lol blizzard is making astronomically more money from classic than retail
[1:58:19] justskeeting11: “you think you want it but you don’t”
[1:58:19] windatar: Such a bad take, new content has been GARBAGE since Wotlk.
[1:58:19] ama__deus: for the most part
[1:58:20] Degran: I would not have played wow for the last 5 years w/o classic. Like it would just be a net-player loss.
[1:58:20] SuperSkunkFunk: hes not all wrong
[1:58:21] nxdRn: Chan said many ppl msg him and then took it back KEKW
[1:58:22] rubljr: in reality most of us wouldnt play WoW if we didnt have classic
[1:58:24] Happylat: I only returned to wow due to Classic - so it goes both ways :)
[1:58:25] SuperSkunkFunk: and i love classic
[1:58:26] bigwilly3737: if classic wasnt here wow would be dead
[1:58:28] asloff: @christiangodwarrior97 ur pretty argumentative for a christian.
[1:58:30] CamGG__: glad he spammed it 10 times so we could go over this garbage take
[1:58:31] rahien_: i gave up on wow, classic got me back
[1:58:31] catbalou2: Retail is beyond saving unless they completely redo it
[1:58:33] hutchyy917: i wouldn't be playing wow at all if it was retail only
[1:58:33] jaymesze: Nostalgia Sells though
[1:58:34] Kizira: @ama__deus exactly
[1:58:35] christiangodwarrior97: @Reaperz_kinetic why should i say what 1+1 is fr
[1:58:36] ParfumAmerican: all version in 1 game - you go to a portal and are in classic :D
[1:58:37] Viisionz74: I guess im fucked up cause i like all of them @Xaryu  :(
[1:58:41] ventiLatte: Into 3* technically.
[1:58:41] lilplatotv: They need to like package all the classic content into retail somehow, chromie time into classic and get retail rewards for it or something
[1:58:42] daerbgge: even within the group that likes classic wow, some players want it changed a bit. while others want #nochanges
[1:58:50] gulerodsslikker25: Too many versions right now
[1:58:51] javlini: noone needs retail though
[1:58:53] ub3rm0nk3y: there are 5 versions lol
[1:58:54] Django_7: there are 5 versions
[1:58:55] Captainpikaboo: 5
[1:58:57] riddlerboy: It's always been that way with private servers
[1:58:57] NareeM: why dont they open public pulls to see what people wants
[1:58:58] jbeemerks: cata classic is a bad idea.  classic should play through vanilla-wrath and then start over.
[1:58:59] SandreX11: !ASSASSIN
[1:59:00] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[1:59:00] Reaperz_kinetic: @christiangodwarrior97 because it should be easy... but they havent done anything good so you cant..
[1:59:01] dirk_mcgurk: SSF hardcore and regular
[1:59:04] MKDarker: Era, Classic, HC, SoD, Retail uff ^^
[1:59:05] Maiqthehighking: too many versions of wow
[1:59:05] zerozuckerl: when is cata release`?
[1:59:07] lilplatotv: They need to like package all the classic content into retail somehow, chromie time into classic and get retail rewards for it or something.
[1:59:07] HelluvaWrecks: get rid of retail
[1:59:10] Guineasaur: There was only 1 version of wow that made it so popular.
[1:59:12] Xytho: Splitting the community is rough
[1:59:14] pheigngaming: You can't even compare classic to retail. They aren't even close to the same game, the provide different things.
[1:59:20] rahien_: my friends who do classic wouldnt even play retail at all, i dont think it only splits players, i think it brings in different players too
[1:59:22] gbaraldi1: Cata classic seems unnecessary now
[1:59:23] Neezai: @camgg__ glad you’re mad about a legit opinion and hearing xar’s opinion 🙂
[1:59:24] beeeVAL: ive never played wow before, jumping into retail seems intimidating, but I started when SOD came out and have been loving it. So classic is better for new player imo. Giving a fresh start brings new people in and wont feel intimidated from being so behind.
[1:59:26] frozeusgaming: Xar plays classic because it got him 4 times the views. I miss retail Xar.
[1:59:27] TMMOOF: me over here just wanting official tbc servers again lol
[1:59:27] JamesIRL: sounds like, you think you do, but you dont
[1:59:30] Acework: they have more player retention when the content is over in one version
[1:59:34] inspect4: Watch echos 2v3 too
[1:59:34] qidalong: did you alrdy quit self found? after dying once?
[1:59:35] shapebender: not enough resources to fully support each version
[1:59:36] CamGG__: @Neezai garbage take
[1:59:37] lilplatotv: They need to like package all the classic content into retail somehow, chromie time into classic and get retail rewards for it or something
[1:59:37] Django_7: i dont think any1 is pissed off being able to play what they want @Xaryu
[1:59:39] Mmmarcoman: Game celebrates 20th anniversary of release at the end of this year. Not sure how much I can care about retail content seeing I was there through it all in 2005-2010
[1:59:40] boky022: I am playing wotlk and sod in same time
[1:59:41] Tuppin: just make a classic mode in retail
[1:59:44] ashraf_ma: Watch the pika clip @Xaryu You missed one
[1:59:45] CitizenDesmond: As said, many who play classic wouldnt play wow if it didnt exist
[1:59:45] mfwillie: its just a money funnel
[1:59:46] Reaperz_kinetic: blizzard in its current state isnt smart enough to critically think about things like this and do the difficult things that need to be done
[1:59:47] daerbgge: @HelluvaWrecks silly. why would a company cut off their major money making scheme
[1:59:47] Teeveesnacks69: nah those people who are pissed off should go touch grass
[1:59:50] pheigngaming: Classic wow should definitely end at Wrath imo, cata changes the classic world.
[1:59:50] machomadness78: this is what hollywood only focuses on remakes and super hero movies and video game show/movies.  Too much of a risk to start a new franchise or IP
[1:59:52] Guineasaur: Trying to please everyone usually displeases fans
[1:59:54] Neezai: @camgg__ why you mad?
[1:59:55] ScryerTV: yeah just scrap all games and only keep wow, same logic
[1:59:56] coldyair: I subbed to WoW after years cause there is a lot of game modes to play
[1:59:56] windatar: If SoD didn't exist, I wouldn't be playing WoW at all. If they got rid of Classic/Era they would lose all those players. Retail is just garbage for these types of players.
[1:59:57] bigwilly3737: @frozeusgaming bc its a better version of the game and ppl like to watch it over trash retail
[2:00:00] ShingaTV: xD
[2:00:02] jbeemerks: if none of the versions are dead then it’s fine.

[2:13:58] LoKoGaR123: cata

[2:14:50] tr0bs: cant even call retail an mmo lol
[2:14:52] biggercheesy: Cata is the worst of both worlds, it lacks the soul of classic and the endgame replayability of retail
[2:15:05] CeeTeeM: The community is the best part
[2:15:06] rns_aurelius: "critical social structures" spamming lfg gnomeragon 6/6  xp have world buffs and consumes
[2:15:07] Xgeonmar: vanilla wow had more quality of life compared to most mmo's at its time tbh
[2:15:08] LoKoGaR123: @tr0bs what do you call an MMO tho? because it is an MMO just an end game MMO

[2:23:59] inspect4: Cata mop wows peak unless 5 button rotation is too hard for u
[2:24:00] batchestspam: kung fu panda went too far
[2:24:00] slapshotsd: @Mmmarcoman that's the point??
[2:24:01] chazmc89: mop was sick
[2:24:02] Barleycorned: I remember watching that expansion announcement via online blizzcon and being gooped. Turned out great though, such a good expansion
[2:24:03] gbaraldi1: Look at this shit
[2:24:03] YzieGG: 6 talents KEKW
[2:24:07] gbaraldi1: 6 talents
[2:24:08] pudnpopz: true

[2:24:13] twilightzoned02: same
[2:24:15] digaboom: at least Retail is starting to fix Talents
[2:24:16] thechosennug: imagine MOP with classic talent atructure
[2:24:19] palo48: The talents were better then later though, wod and legion watered them down
[2:24:22] Zinaroth: Mop killed feral hybrids.
[2:24:22] tankabito: mop shadow priest mmmmmmm

[2:25:02] NotoriousTWIG: I miss the Klaxxi TBH
[2:25:02] McCape7: Its 2024 they should go away with "server" as concept completely and do something like runescape does where you can select a layer/world
[2:25:06] srsdfg: MoP leveling was great
[2:25:06] Banarnes: whats the point of different servers then

[2:25:32] PoMsN: get 18 mages with legendary fast fast
[2:25:34] KKonaStevieG: i think the more people interact with eachother the more they realize they don't want to interact with eachother KEKW
[2:25:35] Maiqthehighking: raid finder sucks
[2:25:36] fuchai: Do you think SoD will continue into TBC?
[2:25:36] brammertime: I didnt realize that group finder spawned from population issues
[2:25:46] urmadlife: Ds was so bad
[2:25:46] x_jdot: faceroll content
[2:25:52] Xgeonmar: this has to be the most lazy boss design
[2:25:54] 95alle95: afk finder my friend called it kekw

[2:26:02] Darkozul: Making thunderfury on hardcore horde defias pillager tomorrow 10pm

[2:26:08] darkeh24: raids should be gate kept
[2:26:09] Goldarrow: i use to join raids and just sit there
[2:26:11] normageqq: LFR is just classic pugging
[2:26:12] espi: STV in 35
[2:26:13] brumstool: Such a bad system, participation trophies
[2:26:16] dirbagdan: if you cant join a guild and do the raid then too bad so sad you dont get to do it. be social or get left behind
[2:26:18] Reaperz_kinetic: they shouldve never added LFG
[2:26:20] Darkozul: tomorrow 10pm
[2:26:20] silverwasp: saw a video say 3% or sth
[2:26:21] McCape7: There are people that are too scared to do mythic plus at all, like even +2. You cant make content for everybody
[2:26:24] probeu: its good to have things to aspire to, even if you never achieve them
[2:26:27] ImGravycakes: alot

[2:26:33] KhalBones: Me :)
[2:26:34] sekcmexi99: me
[2:26:35] windatar: If everyone can complete the content, then there is no carrot for people to work towards. No carrot, then people just stop playing it.
[2:26:36] HelluvaWrecks: They think that because theyre trying to sell the game to as many people as possible
[2:26:36] HiKilla_: legit almost no one
[2:26:37] PoMsN: twitch chat has
[2:26:38] KhalBones: 25 HC
[2:26:39] SilentCivilian1: :(
[2:26:40] ferknasty: wotlk is when it got easy
[2:26:42] asloff: less than 2% of players cleared naxx in classic
[2:26:43] Cyreal5: dragonflight was my 1st expac and i killed raz on heroic
[2:26:44] darkeh24: for real almost no one killed illidan
[2:26:44] Xgeonmar: will never get that experience again, its too easy to get information for anything nowadays
[2:26:47] bonewp: I did EZ
[2:26:47] monkagiga47: @fuchai No because they will run out spells to copy from retail
[2:26:53] lukoly: Truly good game design tailoring to the 3%
[2:26:54] valvillamon: @Xaryu isnt that saying like mario kart should get rid of 50CC?
[2:26:56] LilTaisu: people would complain about it nonstop
[2:26:57] saltdalt: i cleared it in wrath
[2:26:58] Darkozul: Making thunderfury on hardcore defias pillager 10 pm tomorrow
[2:26:59] zappa1011: some people prefer PVE to PVP
[2:27:00] Velxir: but now you can just buy cool cosmetics Xaryu you don't need to kill hard to conquer bosses
[2:27:02] urmadlife: i dont understand why people get mad over people doing lower tier content KEKL

[2:27:10] LilTaisu: there is no chance in this day people would be ok with not clearing the content
[2:27:10] Indomitablez: 100%
[2:27:11] Beakz______: the nubs dont wanna hear that tho
[2:27:12] chickodie: only one guild on my server could clear BT weekly....
[2:27:12] DaRukus: What if i'm a casual but not a noob?
[2:27:13] Asaf1s: exactly!
[2:27:13] Cyreal5: @lukoly thats not catering lol

[2:27:25] jbeemerks: 2% and 100% are ridiculous
[2:27:28] darkeh24: carrot on a stick bb
[2:27:31] slapshotsd: it's about development cost xar, they want the max number of people to see the content they spent time and money making even though i agree with you as a player
[2:27:32] rockoelol: people cry on retail when everyone cant get a legendary staff even
[2:27:34] Xgeonmar: boring game design
[2:27:34] Knocktoff: tell this to the sod players on the wowclassic subreddit LMAO
[2:27:34] genjimainofc: its communism, it creeps in everywhere
[2:27:34] 0Phantazy: WHY DONT BLIZZ HIRE XAR??
[2:27:34] RapidRing: BREATH  xD NotLikeThis
[2:27:36] avenira_qt: in some ways i think thats why m+ is so popular in retail becaause you can see others who have achieved something higher than you and it motivates you
[2:27:37] adam_brisbane: look forward to but never get invited to because they had no experienc
[2:27:38] hate_xyz: Madge where's my participation trophy
[2:27:38] zajberjompa: true
[2:27:38] dirbagdan: @asloff i was one of those that never cleared it, but still enjoy classic more than any other expansion. It's the only version that feels like wow
[2:27:41] chickodie: 3% MOUNT SPPPPEEEED
[2:27:46] Saiauriel: I don't even like carrots
[2:27:48] zappa1011: the carrot is still there...just easy to get

[2:27:52] Darkozul: Making thunderfury tomorrow on horde defias pillager 10pm!
[2:27:57] richdawg: u can tell blizz is run by a bunch of leftists. partcipation trophies for everyone
[2:27:57] jbeemerks: there should be some middle ground.  retail has it right now with different difficulty
[2:28:02] valvillamon: lfr loot was always way less powerful than heroic/mythic
[2:28:02] lateloll: @apathy07 ngl, if you parse blue, it only takes you to watch 1 youtube video of how to play ur class to get a purple
[2:28:03] t4pekid: Aware
[2:28:04] soyboywolk: 0.1% raid mount
[2:28:06] asloff: @dirbagdan the only version? not even tbc?
[2:28:08] AllOfKingsPotato: NODDERS tinder
[2:28:11] mercy93: i did! finally
[2:28:13] chobinhood_: it would not be fantastic if i found my wife on tinder
[2:28:14] urmadlife: Wuoh people can do a easier version of this raid and get lower power than me doing the same raid but harder wuoh
[2:28:17] Guydx: I met my girlfriend through tinder, 5 years so far
[2:28:18] brownfiesta: The paradox of choice @Xaryu
[2:28:18] valvillamon: there's still progression from lfr >normal > heroic
[2:28:19] ThisGuyisLocal: this lads is what we call awareness
[2:28:19] ttrapg: i had a guild where we all met in real life every summer it was great. and with cataclysm that was a thing in the past
[2:28:20] Xgeonmar: BASED

[2:28:21] Dunk305: holy fucking based xar
[2:28:21] Awokanwarrior: GATEKEEPING
[2:28:23] windatar: They removed a bunch of stuff to work towards in SoD phase 2, and the forums are literally filled with. "Bored, nothing to do." because Blizz made all the content easy enough to do in a weekend.
[2:28:25] synos___: you are spot on the tinder
[2:28:28] moogy_moog: may be unpopular but i love that in classic versions of the game, if you have max lvl gear and whatnot you can help lowbies! there's hardly any of that in retail - you aren't encouraged to help out
[2:28:29] ElzyyFR: boomer rant was 100% true tho
[2:28:29] 13brill: old man over lol
[2:28:30] taylorsdank: @Guydx same with my wife and i, 4 years!
[2:28:35] KKonaStevieG: KEKW
[2:28:38] Mambalo: we giving dating advice now?
[2:28:38] LoKoGaR123: after an expansion release endgame is the focus, to getting people there is the idea, no matter what
[2:28:39] glaudius: xar starting his andrew tate arc lets GOOOO!!
[2:28:41] Calibur84: Best Single Player MMO
[2:28:42] Calibur84: lol

[2:28:48] pudnpopz: Aware
[2:28:49] thechosennug: :(
[2:28:50] Moronomics: I liked SWTOR
[2:28:52] kinglakes: @shoot_to_thrill_ fucking agreed, times changing its just not the thing anymore and it hard for og wow to let go in my opinion.
[2:28:52] FunkIsThis: OMEGALUL
[2:28:53] taylorsdank: @glaudius he's the complete opposite thank god lmao
[2:28:53] slapshotsd: @glaudius huh
[2:28:55] jaymesze: Xar, speaking of, I dont think we got the story how you and Shannon met.
[2:28:55] PoMsN: swtor was dope
[2:28:56] Frizankbeast: It was solid
[2:28:56] hate_xyz: swtor had potential but it's animations were awful
[2:28:57] DaRukus: SWG was best MMO ever change my mind
[2:28:59] windatar: Swtor was actually fun, Buggy as hell. But it wasn't as bad as people thought.
[2:28:59] D3KHAR: You gotta play this one day
[2:29:01] TastyRiffs: Xaryu what do you think about GG kicking Jellybeans?
[2:29:02] thechosennug: swtor makes me sad so much potential
[2:29:03] iiamBaro: The only game that came close to wow for me was wildstar at the start
[2:29:06] AaahhRealAliens: I wanted swtor to be good so bad…
[2:29:06] guyonlife: swtor Big L
[2:29:07] G2Gbuyer: nah it wasnt that big
[2:29:18] resume___: RIFT was amazing
[2:29:18] MF_Eyedea: warhammer was so good to bad EA made it
[2:29:26] kriethos: @Xaryu pls my boi, start gaming
[2:29:27] slapshotsd: @taylorsdank xar has a healthy relationship with women unlike most of his chat thankfully
[2:29:30] SaltyHalvy: loved my time on this game back in 2011
[2:29:30] McCape7: Swotr is still going right?
[2:29:34] dirbagdan: @asloff the game started to lose me in tbc. and im talking 2006 not classic 2021 or whenever. The world just felt empty to me. It was too much about grinding reputations in dungeons. I know vanilla had it's own grinds but they were optional not a necessary aspect of the game.
[2:29:41] thechosennug: ya mmcape
[2:29:43] Xgeonmar: BASED FORUM OP
[2:29:45] Django_7: @resume___ rift on release was the closest i ve felt to what i experienced playing wow for the first time, was amazing
[2:29:46] ironmouse34: I was a Jedi with dark side power
[2:29:46] Tartuccio: Warhammer online was insanely fun
[2:29:47] c0gnusTV: EA has been failing star wars for over 10 years yet still has the rights to the games make it make sense
[2:30:02] MF_Eyedea: @Tartuccio theres a pserver for warhammer but kinda dead
[2:30:08] resume___: @Django_7 I know right!
[2:30:08] windatar: Engine was really bad.
[2:30:10] Darkozul: Making thunderfury on hardcore defias pillager realm if anyone want to come
[2:30:10] KKonaStevieG: oh that sounds like swg
[2:30:12] gryphyyyy: @xaryu do you still play New World? or plan to?
[2:30:14] hate_xyz: god, that UI was so ugly
[2:30:17] jaaaaanski: the pvp ball game was insane
[2:30:18] Tartuccio: @MF_Eyedea yeah I used to play there for some months
[2:30:22] Bizzylife: hero engine xD
[2:30:22] Calibur84: I remember that shit

[2:30:43] LoKoGaR123: this game has the BEST story tho of any mmo
[2:30:52] FunkIsThis: YEP lag ruins MMOs
[2:30:54] StepBrotherWAUD: i would only play at wierd hours to reduce the lag
[2:30:54] justskeeting11: what game is this
[2:31:00] justskeeting11: I see
[2:31:02] LoKoGaR123: i played this game as a single player, it's great
[2:31:02] TtsstTV: swtor pvp was insane.. huttball.. unluck the bugs
[2:31:08] logsnar: honestly an enjoyable game
[2:31:10] xAlastor89: everyone tried to do an mmo back then
[2:31:12] dirbagdan: theres a good private server now
[2:31:15] LoKoGaR123: @TtsstTV the fps lag tho Sadge
[2:31:20] Killahsunz: pvp was the only fun thing. I pl;ayed it for awhile
[2:31:24] c0gnusTV: swtor is built on a piece of shit engine though it was a great game in the beginning
[2:31:29] severalmoose: Did anyone play wildstar?
[2:31:30] aadeBirger: the whistling in the background is fcking with me
[2:31:37] Killahsunz: they missed the mark with SWOTR
[2:31:37] MrMowf: hey i have a follow up to last weeks bloodgod finds!  after thinking Xalatah may be "the promised soul" and that there may actually be some Lore to the item...  i think its more or less an oversized troll mob and rather than code im differently than others, they put the sword on him for extra sound effects.  i found the spell and sound on another item for a higher level quest.  can search wowhead for "soul claim" !

[2:32:13] hate_xyz: MoP was amazing! A lot of people hated it because of pandas though.
[2:32:16] hot6auce: MoP was so good for arena

[2:32:24] xAlastor89: pandaland lol
[2:32:30] lntuu: dude MOP was amazing
[2:32:30] McCape7: If mop came before cataclysm it would have been even better
[2:32:31] brumstool: Cata really was the killer
[2:32:37] Durlog: i stopped playing retail with MOP
[2:32:41] elbee89: panda this!
[2:32:45] Biobob666: pandalands was dope, my farm was clean af
[2:32:49] gunzpewpew: Cata was the reason MoP failed. I was so fed up with the game when they released the mop trailer. I was so wrong. When I got back into the game in late MoP it was soooooo good
[2:32:53] dirbagdan: @MasterQuinobi most people did lol. I think servers were live for less than a year befoe it tanked
[2:32:54] MrMowf: @Reaperz_kinetic still think the find of the spell effect on another item is interesting xd
[2:32:54] CoolTrainerTrev: I think it was just the pandas, mop was so good gameplay wise
[2:32:56] Moronomics: Gameplay in MOP was S tier
[2:32:56] ognizzler: MOP was fun

[2:33:00] ehweron: wrath was already too comic tbh
[2:33:03] jaymesze: MoP had the best art
[2:33:04] Calibur84: MoP gameplay good. Everything else is lame
[2:33:06] dika93: Dragonflight got the worst graphics
[2:33:06] zerozuckerl: what was so great about MOP arena? never played it
[2:33:07] halfchubstrangler: I think it was just the natural progression of the 1st gen of the core audience beginning to age out
[2:33:08] zen0vae: it was the 11 months of dragon soul that kill wow

[2:51:17] saltmachine92: probably
[2:51:17] KosmicDevil_: would be cool if they added epic versions of them
[2:51:17] Kudamike: level 60 upgrade for free
[2:51:18] Reaperz_kinetic: @myyrlidon nah
[2:51:22] wavecadet: we use them for 2 phases
[2:51:28] pdrsxz: xar how do yo see the mage in pvp this son p2?

[2:51:31] skerrzo: new mounts for 60 event
[2:51:31] yaboyKobra: give us armored ones to earn
[2:51:31] Kaskiw: They need to add a mount bag, there are too many mounts to carry around
[2:51:32] gunzpewpew: I mean 85% of the playerbase will have these by then
[2:51:32] melvinguyy: maybe they add 2 100% ones
[2:51:33] Scharkov: they reason I dont farm them because of the 60% speed
[2:51:34] acaciashrub: i think they’ll have a upgrade for coins
[2:51:35] Kersed805: bet there will be newer cooler mounts
[2:51:36] espi: there'll be new mounts at 60 probably
[2:51:36] uwu2022: they should do 120% mount speed

[2:51:51] impact4564: prob armored versions at 60

[2:53:24] kaiyika: could it be that the raptor mount have slightly better graphics? or am i peppega
[2:53:32] strip83: i think blizzard dont give a f about what ppl really like, otherwise they should integrate in game options to ask players some questions, for exmp. are you ready for next cap ??:)?

[3:05:40] miciahclay: don't forget to use rewind time
[3:05:43] BigSeany69: so what is happening?
[3:05:43] wreck561: 45
[3:05:44] gunzpewpew: There are always 5-6 mage groups on the altar where the boss is

[3:07:18] dae_bed: run to body its better
[3:07:19] paraizord: !assassin

[3:09:38] adam_brisbane: yes ness is the worst spawn
[3:09:40] kief770: nessing is the worst one
[3:09:43] batchestspam: yes
[3:09:44] CursedSeraphim: but how does anybody get 3k coins from this.
[3:09:45] batchestspam: nessing and beach are the wrost

[3:09:48] mistahfrank: i wait to spawn after other mage groups. you can see them in ghost.
[3:09:50] jazzyjoff: beach is the worst one for this strat
[3:09:52] xxxmagicwizardxxx: more like season of bots
[3:09:53] kief770: boss pats out of range from altar as well
[3:09:54] BarberSnipez: beach is worst
[3:09:58] jazzyjoff: ZG is king
[3:09:59] zimtstern26: beach its the worst
[3:09:59] Ardal_Obe: oh look, only 10 mage groups doing the same thing
[3:10:02] dapps231: when does the 100% exp buff go in??
[3:10:03] reluchan: great content in SOD...are you playing HC soon ?

[3:10:05] Eggzactly54: it was me
[3:10:07] Pilky02: LUL
[3:10:09] batchestspam: if u get arena u can get 4k+
[3:10:09] Reaperz_kinetic: @Yamamoto78 thats an awful analogy
[3:10:09] Pilky02: genius.
[3:10:17] bigwilly3737: Genius? lol
[3:10:21] YzieGG: amazing gameplay KEKW
[3:10:22] zerozuckerl: xar down bad
[3:10:24] miciahclay: delay your spwan, altar is wiped by the time you start
[3:10:27] Yamamoto78: @Reaperz_kinetic who are u?
[3:10:27] Knocktoff: @Reaperz_kinetic thats true, in a lot of cases unintended player interaction is very good, but it also can be bad. its a case of protecting players from themselves in this instance. A class has an unfair advantage to farm blood over others because of a tactic others cant replicate. it looks fun as hell, but is it good for the health of other classes?
[3:10:28] glaudius: i have no clue wtf these sod world pvp events are... is it free for all 5 man parties all vs all? objectives?
[3:10:29] absolute3x: PepoG max_health + max_health+healthspike, do until my nigga
[3:10:35] iJKOVY: worst one is the beach by far

[3:10:46] ferknasty: arena horrible
[3:10:46] blazzedzz: I'm sure jindo's Beach is soooo much better Kappa
[3:10:48] Reaperz_kinetic: @Yamamoto78 youre typing in a public chat lol.. im someone whos responding KEKW
[3:10:54] batchestspam: it should increase as the game goes as more ppl funnel to boss
[3:10:54] absolute3x: that last line sucks im sorry
[3:10:54] Daracus98: arena has trash spawns
[3:10:57] zerozuckerl: @Elliyan134 5 mages, massregen + arcane explosion spam
[3:10:58] ballerdeluxe: I got 4.5k at arena
[3:11:04] miciahclay: arena is nice bc you can spirit res to the altar every time
[3:11:04] Kulefisk: @Xaryu venruki says u are gonna join The Move and quit classic! comfirm ? :D
[3:11:04] StunningPaul: Wait for the other mage group to spawn .  They come in and wipe yall out each time
[3:11:07] absolute3x: i go away now
[3:11:16] Tyrmag: Has the attempt to kill the blood god been given up on?
[3:11:20] shadowvypers: need to coordinate going in

[3:11:41] ponaris: mark yourselves for visibility
[3:11:42] miciahclay: just the whole team I mean
[3:11:43] zerozuckerl: can you be attacked with the debuff? or completely immune, wondering why they are able to just sit and drink/eat
[3:11:47] miciahclay: split the mage groups
[3:11:57] Grevira: Put Raid Markers over your heads
[3:12:00] Reaperz_kinetic: @Knocktoff i mean there are plenty of classes that can 5 stack and have different strats... as you can see this strat isnt really ruining it for anyone else
[3:12:16] Reaperz_kinetic: @Yamamoto78 no... i understood it the analogy is just bad
[3:12:19] Sxnv: @zerozuckerl cant be hit with debuff
[3:12:19] absolute3x: To be fair I recently watched Belly which stars DMX and NAS

[3:12:42] sacrifaidxd: take spirit
[3:12:42] zerozuckerl: probably lagged
[3:12:42] jazzyjoff: You got 2 min rez cd
[3:12:43] krulfar: @Reaperz_kinetic It's amazing for paladins, you just last hit the mages kills while they aoe, even better with bubble

[3:13:25] absolute3x: Belly is under the radar. I feel like a lot of people skipped it like I did, it's actually really good
[3:13:29] dombobble: it's bc you didn't die to pvp
[3:13:31] papaotter: It's because of npc death, not the debuff

[3:13:35] No_Fate_1989: its just a normal timer from dieing too often
[3:13:42] MrMowf: min rez means you died while in combat with a pve mob.  bruised JUST MEANS you drop more blood after dying to the loa.

[3:15:46] miciahclay: its just the first death
[3:15:48] everybodydance8: someone tell him what bruised actually does
[3:15:48] mistahfrank: no you only have to die once
[3:15:51] espi: nothing to do with the bruised debuff
[3:15:52] Yamamoto78: @Reaperz_kinetic i was just curious how long you would cry about it
[3:15:52] dombobble: it's bc you didn't die to pvp
[3:15:54] timeoutandy: talked with a gm :)
[3:15:56] macjcool: you died to pve

[3:17:48] chr47: 100% mages get 30 coins per event
[3:17:51] miciahclay: I think some groups are getting 60+ with a good spawn and boss near
[3:17:52] Vevovic: theres about 5 groups there
[3:17:52] espi: Xar there's a VOD of a mage grp getting 86 Silver in 1 event
[3:17:55] Vevovic: weve killed eachother
[3:17:56] savagedabs4623: bull shipping

[3:19:10] chr47: I'm literally leveling a mage right now XD
[3:19:20] xxxmagicwizardxxx: from watching you your runing in clicking 1 button spam and runing back to your corpse looks fun lol

[3:19:51] blazzedzz: The event might be better if you remove the blood LOA
[3:19:51] yami_yugi_87: all teh time invested in the quest chain
[3:19:57] parkrangerpeter: Classic players min-maxing the fun out of a game
[3:19:57] jazzyjoff: Tbh, almost every class shines in this form at some moment
[3:19:57] Knocktoff: @Reaperz_kinetic see
[3:19:59] TheShazamMan: as a melee, this is not fun at all lol
[3:20:00] AbyssReborn: You sure about that?
[3:20:05] Vichrinox: @yami_yugi_87 youll still have it next phase and the buff wont be there next phase
[3:20:07] Ervill1: players ruin the game and then blame blizzard
[3:20:07] Reaperz_kinetic: @Knocktoff i never said they intended it KEKW
[3:20:08] shadowvypers: clever use of game mechanics
[3:20:10] UntouchedExodus: another big nerf for the mages in STV incoming
[3:20:10] asloff: for max dmg do you use your index finger or middle finger to spam arcane explosion? trying to get my dps up xarGKappa
[3:20:12] gunzpewpew: You can say that about anything, but after 20 years they should ANTICIPATE this.
[3:20:14] maniiieelll: @yami_yugi_87 you can use it up to 60
[3:20:16] jazzyjoff: Don't hate the player...
[3:20:16] DanPlaysChess: you should try and kill the big boss.
[3:20:20] Knocktoff: @Reaperz_kinetic but you said it wasnt bad game design
[3:20:21] miciahclay: @blockay_ Honor, AB rep, Mounts
[3:20:23] everybodydance8: watch they fix it by nerfing party blood

[3:21:07] peeetreee: mage on the mount who cares
[3:21:08] sullyman13: @asloff I think he uses his foot pedal
[3:21:08] CoolTV: you could get 10k per event
[3:21:11] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu feels like the event would be so much better by giving blood based on how much damage you did to an opponent vs only the last hit
[3:21:12] jazzyjoff: 50 is a bit to much\
[3:21:13] peeetreee: huge for a melee to be on one
[3:21:15] jazzyjoff: 40 yes
[3:21:15] absolute3x: i wish they bring back the loot bug, where you get stuck looking like a fool
[3:21:17] espi: A mage group got 86 coins
[3:21:18] Sxnv: 1k seems standard yeah
[3:21:18] maniiieelll: you could use a priest too to heal 4 mages
[3:21:19] Slyratt: mage in my guild has both mounts, ab exalted and 500 silver
[3:21:19] foojeez: 10k impossible your cracked
[3:21:23] everybodydance8: 50 would be very very very optimized
[3:21:25] skiitungen: how many kills is it for 1 gold coin?
[3:21:27] rocky_93: stv lag event still not fixed ?
[3:21:33] Reaperz_kinetic: @Knocktoff i never said that either LOL me saying it wasnt bad game design would mean they intended it... i said it wasnt bad for the game which is different

[3:31:14] JukezZA: parties of 2
[3:31:14] blazzedzz: @xaryu maybe remove blood loa so people would spread out more?
[3:31:15] Joxtirol: healer could respec it's 1 gold
[3:31:16] jbeemerks: they should 10x solo coins
[3:31:17] jazzyjoff: You can fix this by remove blood within 30y range of altar
[3:31:17] drastic_go_down: half of these mages dont even have the right runes, too many mage groups disrupting one another now so you're lucky to get 2K COINS in one blood moon tbh
[3:31:18] asloff: fake news
[3:31:18] Rhymm: disable same class groups

[3:31:37] heavyveg: Check the logs ;)
[3:31:38] largist_: id love if there was some damage buff for solo players
[3:31:38] Armaerei: Give the altar infinite health and if you attack it with AoE it reflects dmg back
[3:31:39] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu give bloods on damage done, not last hits
[3:31:40] DeathToad007: PORT BOY

[3:31:46] gunzpewpew: Just remove the whole boss part of it. It is dumb and makes 0 sense. The idea of a world pvp event in the jungle is not to have everyone stack
[3:31:46] jakeloff: feel bad for missing the gifted sub earlier but thank you Porschiey

[4:33:54] skoobss: you make it clear going in what gear is ressed. totally fine. perks of raid leading
[4:33:56] Lekar624: I've never seen Xaryu pvp even once.

[4:34:05] Hyperioz: @gateloz theres a chrono boot rune that's 100% healing thats very good
[4:34:06] stinkychair: @Deatharmor98 tome of cavern something

[4:34:20] xpredicts: What are you currently after from STV event?
[4:34:20] dombobble: wow xar ur cancelled Kappa
[4:34:21] Turkeypitz: @ddraggbagg makes sense, I just thought mages got buffed cause they didn't get benefit of +healing
[4:34:21] asloff: @spicyjimi_ .......... xarDownbad
[4:34:22] Deatharmor98: @stinkychair Its 6 stam, missing the int of the Gnomer OH and has less spell dmg
[4:34:26] Jabdimus: Y'all still yapping about the mage healing damn
[4:34:33] Riv_VK: why chat going off on this it was a OS roll vs OS roll (as in a pvp roll)
[4:34:33] AxelFromAustralia: 2nd boss parse?
[4:34:34] joonelius3: I agree this was right that you rolled, you won fair and square no questions. But hard reserving stuff is unfair. Its way worse than gdkp could ever be.
[4:34:40] Babobop: how's it feel to be cancelled, xar?
[4:34:41] t0merik: Arcane better than fire?
[4:34:41] Dewblus: do you like playing arathi?
[4:34:43] yaskweenishere: yaskweenishere subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Can we get more battleground content?
[4:34:43] shadowvypers: the single person in and out worked well
[4:34:44] stinkychair: @Deatharmor98 it has more sp dmg, the gnomer one is strictly healing. and who cares about 6 int in pvp
[4:34:45] thiccgoat1: is the tiger confirmed yet?
[4:34:48] weil6: Is it confimred STV?
[4:34:53] aroneatingsoup: is there still an OTK dueling tournament?
[4:34:56] realflunk: @joonelius3 but you're not forced to join the run???
[4:34:57] haidenhype: there was a screenshot of the tiger on your reddit @Xaryu
[4:34:58] ctrlbeesy: imagine caring about loot in a raid ur not even in
[4:34:58] donmeredith: Its fair enough @xaryu , they get publicity through your stream and you get their loot
[4:35:01] reallyeric: you get a tan tiger and a raptor from the stv event
[4:35:04] TheSward: @joonelius3 then dont go to that raid, or be your own raid leader
[4:35:04] Heart_tv: @joonelius3 HR in his raid is unfair? LOL
[4:35:04] TokerTy420: @t0merik no
[4:35:04] Daracus98: @joonelius3 why, if everyone agreees beforehand on what items are reserved, its no big deal, everyone knows what they are getting into
[4:35:04] leialol: if people in the raid agree to be there why would u guys even cry but hr stfu
[4:35:05] asloff: yo im trying to brush up on my Xar lore. who tf is julia? do you still love her? and does shannon know? inquiring minds want to know
[4:35:05] Duckduckgoose38: @joonelius3 No, forget that. I put the effort into making the group  and running it ima take one piece with me lol
[4:35:06] Viisionz74: Didnt driney post that
[4:35:08] Viisionz74: @Xaryu
[4:35:09] enocchh: @joonelius3 lol. the people who joined agreed to the HR. Its not like he's ninja looting
[4:35:14] piperboi: what screenshot? LUL
[4:35:16] Kudamike: i dont see a problem with HR at all. If I have that item, its a normal run. Dont like it dont join
[4:35:17] Madmaxx777: its gotta be ZG rep reward related right?
[4:35:17] kilo591: Careful not to jump off the elevator early. You can be dc-d and ported to the back entrance
[4:35:20] miciahclay: @joonelius3 Just don't join HR runs or start your own run though? The people that joined, joined knowing those items were HR
[4:35:22] evil_tree: like the old days, fake screenshots and guides
[4:35:23] stinkychair: @Deatharmor98 spell healing is not = spell dmg
[4:35:26] Dr0ddy: twitter screenshot was epic quality but mount is a blue in files

[4:35:58] Deatharmor98: @stinkychair Who doesnt want extra dmg in PvP? tahts dumb to say
[4:36:01] enocchh: wait there's parses for this on Warcraft logs?

[4:36:15] Pixiepantss: it is hard to explain lol
[4:36:16] TokerTy420: that board sounds so crispy
[4:36:27] stinkychair: @Deatharmor98 hes getting less dmg with the gnomer offand thats all im saying. and 100 mana is negligible in pvp he still gets the same stam
[4:36:35] asloff: @TokerTy420 lubed up and ready to go xarGKappa
[4:36:35] poggeringthelair: FOR GNOMEREGAN
[4:36:54] joonelius3: oh yes the good old classic ”then just dont join” do you realize why making group takes 2-3 hrs now? because people have mutiple groups forming all the time because of greedy hr runs, parse nerds etc.
[4:36:58] absolute3x: do you like Edge's theme song
[4:36:59] IamBlessedness: Cheer1000à
[4:37:00] Deatharmor98: @stinkychair Not necessarily, he has the 6 int to make up for the 7 spell dmg, and then gets more healing from his Chronostatic

[4:37:29] stinkychair: @Deatharmor98 which doesnt equal more dmg lmao dunno what ur trying to say
[4:37:34] romanisroamin: everyone whos saying the BFD off hand is better is actually cooked as hell, the BFD off has 6 stam only and 7 sp, the gnomer is 6 stam 6 int and 22 HP...
[4:37:36] Deatharmor98: @stinkychair The crit def helps
[4:37:37] miciahclay: @joonelius3 Make a guild, run with the same 10 every time, stop pugging
[4:37:49] Perkasetz: Chat really going in
[4:37:52] Yamamoto78: the paladin can solo tank
[4:37:52] reallyeric: xaryu pls find another lorfy wow playlist this one has like 4 songs on it
[4:37:52] TheSward: @joonelius3 you're not owed an automatic group invite to any group and have it be run the way you specifically want it to be run. that makes zero sense
[4:37:54] Perkasetz: ya'll need to chill
[4:37:55] morghuliz: basically he needs to bait the debuff if range grp already has it so he can go in melee?

[4:38:03] Reck179: danse
[4:38:12] Sastan: Just face the boss to u
[4:38:16] Always_Something: Xar you solo it as a mage. Ranged group stack, you stay behind melee. Once ranged groups hit you run out. Once you get targeted blink to melee.
[4:38:16] ctrlbeesy: touch grass
[4:38:22] Deatharmor98: @stinkychair overall theyre quite comparable, not much diff between the 2
[4:38:32] joonelius3: oh woooow hadnt thought of that mate O.o or maybe I am in guild and pug with my alts. @miciahclay

[4:44:26] bray_qt: theres an sod extentsion
[4:44:28] tedo781: atlas sod I think
[4:44:28] Daracus98: sod
[4:44:28] kirk_hunts: @resume___ It would have to be serpent sting chimaera scaling with spell power after the buff tomorrow
[4:44:30] dombobble: atlasloot_sod
[4:44:38] brunkzbecrunkz: I wish we could not worry about logs so much. so many groups are so concerned. my wife loves raiding but doesn’t have the best of logs but truely enjoys the raids, I feel terrible if someone is talking bad about her. @xaryu
[4:44:40] miciahclay: @joonelius3 As am I, if it takes you 2-3 hrs to find a raid that's due to poor parses and undesirable spec you are playing. That's not an issue with raid groups. That's either a design issue or a skill issue
[4:44:42] macjcool: what was that rp3 thing you dld earlier
[4:44:45] peashooterpete: I had to get the cursed forge app, couldn't find it standalone
[4:44:48] resume___: @kirk_hunts it was simming high before the MM buffs also
[4:44:49] fonthy: !addon
[4:44:49] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[4:44:49] Wabbajakkc: LUL
[4:45:02] bray_qt: heres to myself for not giving a single fuck about a parse
[4:45:04] kirk_hunts: @resume___ I'm sure it was if that's happening
[4:45:07] Prickett: is he healing?
[4:45:11] Dewblus: I know boomers who manually put addons in their folder but man.. when it comes to updating
[4:45:13] Gac_Ttv: got mine this saturday and trinket with mana regen too :D
[4:45:15] iPlayCuzFun: that staff makes no sense on boomkins, seen plenty of boomies with it
[4:45:16] scarko_: @Xaryu did you made this weak aura for the buffs?
[4:45:17] JUMJUMnoMi: such and impolite request ? where's the twitch prime I swear Xar is too nice
[4:45:24] clamshell24: help her get better
[4:45:28] ctrlbeesy: lmaoooooooo
[4:45:29] SloMo904: join a guild
[4:45:29] admiration: i think gnomer is a mechanic raid
[4:45:30] TheHieroja: @iPlayCuzFun why?
[4:45:30] eWreck36: wife needs to git gud
[4:45:32] ThisGuyisLocal: needs a better parsing husband tbh
[4:45:33] eWreck36: jk
[4:45:36] Stomachfakie: green means go
[4:45:37] puzuga: its rude to be a bad player
[4:45:38] ctrlbeesy: nerdge
[4:45:38] LilTaisu: maybe help your wife press her buttons better or just join a guild theres tons that dont care
[4:45:43] Perkasetz: There is plenty of non-competetive groups
[4:45:43] melvinguyy: i have never seen anyone talk down to someone because of logs
[4:45:44] StunningPaul: Sounds like your wife is the 48 parser I lost epic blade to PopNemo
[4:45:44] ipositive: teach her how to play the game :)
[4:45:44] PaperbackWritter: it is not for casuals yeah
[4:45:45] theonlypadrejoe: easier content is better for everyone, sweats can parse and casuals dont need to min/max
[4:45:45] beastnephew3: can i see warriors dmg breakdown? @Xaryu
[4:45:50] theDRG: everything is about optimization
[4:45:52] ctrlbeesy: its so fkin rude to be a bad player
[4:45:53] logic__: exactly, do the meta or you're shit
[4:45:56] Slyratt: if you have that issue you need to raid in a guild with the same mindset
[4:45:57] teejway__: see asmon and ziqo's take on parses and current state of raiding?
[4:45:58] Sollidie: This is just such an easy game its stupid
[4:45:58] Tinman_VF: Are we just expected to carry garbage?
[4:45:58] Glennr16: 20 years ago now
[4:46:00] Glennr16: sadge
[4:46:00] cjplayingu: it was worse when wow first came out
[4:46:02] hazuki_15: 10 years?
[4:46:03] ctrlbeesy: the AUDACITY
[4:46:07] clamshell24: we did have yt, it came out in 04
[4:46:08] alexrose7: its also just a game
[4:46:08] HunterericTV: make her heal if she isnt already :D healer healing logs dont matter if ur not dpsing in free time LUL
[4:46:09] Atruis_: sounds like real life
[4:46:10] hazuki_15: thats like MoP breh
[4:46:11] Nieghbor_: @Xaryu did you guys ever defeat that world boss at the PVP arena you got the big groups together for?
[4:46:11] morghuliz: its not really about min max xaryu but when you see people with grays it means they dont even know the basics of their class or didnt bother to grab enchs/consums/wbs
[4:46:11] Atp64: gitgud
[4:46:12] TheSerrion: lmao using words wrong all the time
[4:46:13] rizka912: the globalists ruined wow
[4:46:14] Yamamoto78: just ban all the addons and logging
[4:46:14] Lekar624: BTC is the fix
[4:46:14] jbeemerks: logs are aids
[4:46:15] Haematopodidae: @Tinman_VF least toxic classic player
[4:46:16] JoeBangles_: 10 years ago 10 years ago
[4:46:16] packtar: you can make your logs private
[4:46:17] hovoxo: improving
[4:46:18] parkrangerpeter: ban 3rd party sites lmao
[4:46:19] diontdee: remove addons
[4:46:19] Indomitablez: @Xaryu Joker did a test this morning, he hid his logs and joined a pug as a frost mage to see if people would invite him. He ended up getting in a group of people who didnt know who he was to prove a point it can be done. Just hide logs
[4:46:20] Knocktoff: @brunkzbecrunkz try finding a guild that has room for both of you with a focus thats not too worried about parses, also on pve servers people are generally nicer about things like this
[4:46:21] iPlayCuzFun: @TheHieroja it has arcane spellpower and healing power, and boomies do mor than half nature dmg i think
[4:46:21] xAlastor89: those damn globalists!
[4:46:22] Fai_z: join a guild
[4:46:24] ctrlbeesy: 360 no scopes
[4:46:24] jackbbooolin: this raid is a joke
[4:46:24] whiskerbiskitt: make your own raid and invite like-minded people
[4:46:25] puzuga: I don't drive a garbage truck, im not carrying garbage
[4:46:25] Babobop: the bar is raised honestly, there are plenty of guilds who don't care
[4:46:26] adam_brisbane: ban add ons then the log would not work
[4:46:26] Knocktoff: the fix is joining a guild
[4:46:28] furesway: Fix is to build time machine and go back to OG Everquest when gaming was gaming.
[4:46:30] Tinman_VF: ITS NOT MY JOB TO CARRY GREY PARSERS
[4:46:31] Sollidie: *CHECKING LOGS* 99% of lfg
[4:46:33] joonelius3: @miciahclay first of all I said making a raid not finding a pug. Which you said in the beginning too mate just admit to yourself time to go touch grass.
[4:46:37] JUMJUMnoMi: @Sollidie ofc people like you downplaying everything makes it better and fun
[4:46:38] kipheh: tried so hard not to say “git gud” hehe
[4:46:39] Voidrox: yeah, but this is a toxic way of playing the game, it doesn't matter if you have 99 parse, you will still be able to clear gnome
[4:46:40] J_Rich94: this game isnt about getting through as fast as possible
[4:46:40] ctrlbeesy: this raid makes me fall asleep mid pull its so easy
[4:46:43] isykaky: @Xaryu Thats why you look at logs?
[4:46:48] Ervill1: its really not that impressive to do good dps in sod, idk why these people are so crazy about this
[4:46:48] hursonheison: trench monkaW
[4:46:48] Arendiel_: o7
[4:46:49] Duckduckgoose38: My guild does it 45-50min but no one really talks :c

[4:46:50] koyoshii: o7
[4:46:50] Knocktoff: monkaS
[4:46:50] Rcukar: Currents are 10 man, so harder to carry players compared to 20 man+
[4:46:50] TocaRed: monkaW
[4:46:50] LithoSlam: rip
[4:46:51] KosmicDevil_: hardcore moment

[4:46:51] espi: The classic Gnomer experience YEP
[4:46:52] sullyman13: PETRI
[4:46:53] Nize2: harcdcore memories Aware
[4:46:54] morghuliz: it doesnt matter if u join a guild , if u parse bad u still gonna get carried
[4:46:55] Kisotope_: casuals go to HC now
[4:46:55] J_Rich94: concecration
[4:46:55] sebfrafestegnen: RUN FOR THE HILLS

[4:47:06] mrwaddles22: thas what she said
[4:47:06] joonelius3: you are trying to switch subject evey other msg because you ran out of excuses. @miciahclay
[4:47:07] Dewblus: huh
[4:47:09] KosmicDevil_: movement down south huh
[4:47:09] Loodimus: HUH
[4:47:10] Indomitablez: @Xaryu Just hide logs on the website and if enough people do it logs will only matter to a select few
[4:47:11] reallyeric: WOT
[4:47:11] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu honestly the sad part is most of the time positioning is more important than dps in raids but dps is the only thing that logs care about
[4:47:11] alexrotaru000: HC trauma
[4:47:11] incognito_enjoyer: Last lockout I invited a enhancement shaman that didn't have logs and I believed in him. He ended up winning the power depleted boots that I needed to complete my three-piece and he gave it to me for trusting in him, he didn't join my late night guild. What a start of a beautiful friendship
[4:47:12] killswitch941: remember when wow used to be really social now in retail no one talks at all
[4:47:13] G0bbeh_: RAID WARNING

[4:47:13] Jixson_: monkaW
[4:47:13] blazzedzz: Ziqo has a great vid on this topic
[4:47:14] ipositive: you could just put in the tiniest bit of effort to not be bad as well its not hard
[4:47:14] theDRG: Its funny how easily you can tell if someone has experienced a true Gnomer Nightmare
[4:47:16] Golem250: 30 min buffs!
[4:47:19] Miraelia: even joining a guild is kinda hard rn they all want strong players
[4:47:23] miciahclay: @joonelius3 It takes 2-3 hrs to make a raid bc of lack of healers, not any of the things you originally said
[4:47:28] whuca: whuca subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! yoooo
[4:47:28] Knocktoff: EZ thank you
[4:47:29] rizka912: warcraftlogs = leaderboards, the competition is fun
[4:47:30] Yamamoto78: dps doesnt even carry the raid, if you do the 1 mechanic the boss will eventually die
[4:47:31] pproffit: Do healing logs matter if no one dies?
[4:47:32] crazycluck: @Miraelia ??
[4:47:33] melvinguyy: just make her heal honestly
[4:47:34] Golem250: Friendly reminder
[4:47:41] benjocre4m: i run one
[4:47:42] Haematopodidae: no its not fake news
[4:47:42] logic__: too many shitter guilds trying to be "semi-hardcore"
[4:47:42] masoud86: Tudo bem? @Xaryu
[4:47:42] Eggzactly54: i watched the ziqo vid last night. its good. and its how fun should be
[4:47:42] Lekar624: Asking for logs on this kind of content is kind of cringe imo
[4:47:43] Dewblus: I’m in one
[4:47:43] Glennr16: Every casual guild I've been in dies in a few months
[4:47:44] J_Rich94: no there are plenty of casual guilds
[4:47:44] benjocre4m: we help noobs
[4:47:45] Perkasetz: most guilds i would say are very nice to other guildies
[4:47:45] duragmeter: whats that proc that looks like arcane power?
[4:47:45] fooclyro: im in one
[4:47:53] Miraelia: @crazycluck at least on eu, it took me like 3 days to find one invite
[4:47:55] Haq_RS: theres definitely casual guilds
[4:47:55] ctrlbeesy: when theres no healers left.. i reroll back to rogue ez logic
[4:47:55] Reck179: osrs music>
[4:47:56] reallyeric: linkin logs
[4:47:57] Raff_Classic: xar would u play wow with a controller?
[4:47:57] Haematopodidae: its just cope from lazy players who dont want to spend time joining a guild
[4:47:58] Madmaxx777: everyone loves playing linkin logs, classic toy
[4:47:59] Atruis_: I have joined a lot of casual guilds that arent actually casual
[4:48:01] soled92: didnt Ziqo take like 9 players that couldnt get an inv to pugs and run a 5/6?
[4:48:01] hi_nk: what is a reasonable floor for performance to play with someone
[4:48:01] alwaysbekindm8: its a mental race to kindness
[4:48:03] jewfest: people only care about min maxing which isnt retail. these raids 25 and 40 are very easy when compared to modern wow. Modern wow doesnt even have this issue that classic wow does
[4:48:03] Jubilation12: MY GUILD HAS OUR MAIN RAID AND CASUAL RAIDS
[4:48:03] king_tedward: theres a lot trust
[4:48:03] learningtogrowtogether: I don’t even know what logs are
[4:48:03] Catalystic_Sudo: my WOTLK guild are super understanding for new players p
[4:48:03] Slyratt: join a guild with the same mindset it’s not hard
[4:48:04] pproffit: Do healng logs matter?
[4:48:05] DTox1890: ive only ever pugged runs and have a 96 average, you dont need a guild run to do well
[4:48:06] kywozen: i literally just helped merge two casual guilds together and we do gnomer with no wipes just not speedrun, theres a ton of casual guilds
[4:48:08] highqualitypowerking: there once was this [L] guild, like learning. remember a post about it
[4:48:13] Yinng_K: @Xaryu my guild accepts anyone regardless of class, spec or logs. We still cleared gnomer w1 and now clear within 1h
[4:48:14] nmitchell219: Honestly so much easier with a casual guild to do the raid lock outs, and actually making friends instead of pugging and not talking to anyone
[4:48:17] Catalystic_Sudo: we run “kindergarten” run of ICC
[4:48:18] joonelius3: no its because healers are making hr raids or joining runs where they get xtra sr. etc @miciahclay
[4:48:19] duragmeter: whats that proc that looks like arcane power?
[4:48:20] Knocktoff: @Miraelia check forums / gen chat and just include that youre looking for like minded players who dont care about parses, odds are theres some with open slots
[4:48:20] iPlayCuzFun: @Raff_Classic that sounds awful ngl
[4:48:24] joh_gaming: Gnomer first try?
[4:48:25] Kudamike: our guild has filled with pugs from LFG. Started with 4 friends.
[4:48:29] Raff_Classic: @iPlayCuzFun apparently many people do it
[4:48:29] Dewblus: considering leaving my guild because the raid leader/gm of the guild was being a cry baby last night during STV
[4:48:32] clbnbbyseals: Where's mitch at?
[4:48:34] Gac_Ttv: can u link that song? @Xaryu
[4:48:36] probeu: hcsf controller challenge

[4:48:37] stormsy222: stormsy222 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:48:41] Catalystic_Sudo: so newer players can learn without the stress of elisist scum bags
[4:48:41] stumpe856: it’s not easy
[4:48:42] franzmarley: controller is doable!
[4:48:43] big_dave_raves: xarbad the zoomer crashing servers you should be banned for life bud
[4:48:50] ZeroScrub: what is the item called u use to look like this?
[4:48:54] iPlayCuzFun: @Raff_Classic my keyboard almost dosnt have enough buttons lmao
[4:48:57] clbnbbyseals: You can play ESO with controller :D
[4:49:03] Sollidie: Realy?
[4:49:05] EmjayNorris: KAPPA
[4:49:05] Babobop: @Catalystic_Sudo lol they're not scumbags for taking things seriously, you can up your game if you wanna raid with better guilds
[4:49:06] Tickletrain: you just jinxed it @Xaryu
[4:49:06] goof8: @ZeroScrub savory deviate delight
[4:49:10] TohsakaTV: what soundtrack is this?
[4:49:11] lolzandis: gnomer is tuned too gih for a level 40 raid tho
[4:49:11] miciahclay: @joonelius3 Because they can, because of healer shortage. That's a design issue. Not an issue with them playing a desired spec and wanting loot for the spec they want to play (shadow/boomy/etc). Don't like it, play a healer and go make non HR runs and never get your dps gear
[4:49:12] Raff_Classic: @iPlayCuzFun i know how that feels lol, but apparently its entirely doable
[4:49:13] Atruis_: can play ffxiv with controller
[4:49:13] ZeroScrub: @goof8 thanks mate
[4:49:13] burkowski: that might be because you dont check logs :)
[4:49:15] kordellbennett: @big_dave_raves still crying about that?
[4:49:18] Capitanii: chat what addon is he using for his raid frames?
[4:49:20] SarcasticApe: GIGACHAD
[4:49:22] JoeBangles_: It's possible, theres a warlock who plays HC on a controller, even tanks twin emps
[4:49:23] king_tedward: @Xaryu best core workouts?
[4:49:23] broxxie1337: MISSING OZY!

[4:49:45] Tinman_VF: this is not a black and white issue

[4:51:00] Babobop: @Babobop mb ironforge
[4:51:00] joonelius3: yes I agree its a design issue, circling back to my first message. hr should be banned not gdkp. gdkp would courage for SP to join a raid as healer aswell. :) also it would make every class wanted in raid again.
[4:51:00] Nize2: the widget volley thing

[4:51:25] miciahclay: @joonelius3 HR being banned would mean even less healers. That doesn't solve anything
[4:51:26] eWreck36: good start
[4:51:37] franzmarley: @Raff_Classic I set up a controller-ui when classic dropped to have a chill different experience. I played rogue and once I ganked a hunter I felt it was good enough. Then it's just up to controller-skills
[4:51:42] kordellbennett: I got my dagger last night was so hype
[4:51:45] iPlayCuzFun: staty stake

[4:52:11] mikeqt: mikeqt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 54 months! GIGACHAD
[4:52:14] Kudamike: slow dps
[4:52:17] Kudamike: on square
[4:52:22] Raff_Classic: @franzmarley i read yesterday that a dude hit gladiator with a controller only, so if it's good for pvp it's just a matter of getting used to it

[4:55:51] miciahclay: @joonelius3 Idk man, are you mad you can't find a healer or mad you can't get the gear you want. There aren't enough healers. Incentives for healers is one way to increase the number of them. HR is a way to create your own incentive for healing since the game doesn't have any

[6:08:29] Indomitablez: @Joryckfree taking advantage before its nerf'd for easy mount
[6:08:29] gen1e: is this not just basically win trading
[6:08:36] carlosantonioar: un me
[6:08:39] Akalskyy: wth is happening
[6:08:45] heckler_and_koch416: this event is a total failure, i cant believe how bad they failed
[6:08:47] Duckduckgoose38: lag
[6:08:48] mistahfrank: you have to click only once when you spawn or it can bug out
[6:08:54] realxRusty: sometimes that happens at that ghost
[6:08:54] HelluvaWrecks: best thing about this strat is how much salt it brings out of everyone
[6:08:57] Joryckfree: @naturalduck isnt this like supposed to be fun pvp event ?
[6:09:00] mistahfrank: yeah its bugs if you spam click "accept"
[6:09:04] Zanzanz: if you spawn in arena it removes debuff I think
[6:09:06] carlosantonioar: stay a little behinde
[6:09:10] carlosantonioar: so u dont die too fast
[6:09:14] Rampetroll: stand there and use blissard
[6:09:18] Krilax2505: don't spam
[6:09:19] Tosh009: Xar use rewidn time if you have
[6:09:21] naturalduck: @joryckfree sure it's fun but after the 20th time you just want the reward
[6:09:27] Joryckfree: why wow players have to always be most efficient and ruin any fun possible in this game ?
[6:09:39] wilybob: he gotta be a npc streamer xD he talks like one xD
[6:09:43] Gumistar: what is the reward of this ?
[6:09:47] mistahfrank: spirit ress instead so you get 100% hp?
[6:09:50] naturalduck: This does not stop you from playing your own way in the pvp event lol
[6:09:58] mindhunter06: @Joryckfree because its a 20 year old game, everything has been figured out and optimized
[6:10:10] espi: @Joryckfree because short boring grind is better than long fun one
[6:10:13] CatformTV: +58
[6:10:15] realandtruephobe: ice block?
[6:10:20] Joryckfree: @espi ???
[6:10:26] gloydthewarrior: @naturalduck I mean its just unbalanced
[6:10:37] greatsadge: oh look the multiboxer is playing like shit lmao gnutz
[6:10:44] Haematopodidae: @Joryckfree dont bother with these wow brained people dude
[6:10:56] Haematopodidae: they hate the game

[6:11:00] feronv: use dbm
[6:11:07] Flerpen: what do they grind?
[6:11:14] Joryckfree: @Haematopodidae yea i can see that its just sad
[6:11:20] naturalduck: @gloydthewarrior it only works because everyone else spamming altar has the same thing in mind. Before this mages were terrible in the event
[6:11:26] Kisotope: @flerpen deaths apparently
[6:11:31] Bojanglez: nice event
[6:11:34] BarberSnipez: That guy is throwing

[6:11:52] Bojanglez: brb eveling mage
[6:12:02] flintstarr: f
[6:12:04] Haematopodidae: to the guy who asked earlier if you should play SoD: this is what the game has become in the fun pvp mode
[6:12:08] MixedBiscuit: this is r1 pvp rightchea
[6:12:10] ZiggyMyDude: ya if boss kills you it counts it as a normal death and gives you a timer
[6:12:12] naturalduck: Spirit rez and group at the corner before altar works
[6:12:13] joemac215: let the bodies hit the floor
[6:12:15] StunningPaul: Gnutz? More like poonutz
[6:12:22] papaseat: the event is so unfinished the boss is using improper english 4Head
[6:12:34] wankels: This is degen mage stuff. The event is so much fun if you avoid this
[6:12:35] realandtruephobe: But is this fun to play?
[6:12:39] sebfrafestegnen: Classic players, was expected
[6:12:40] crazycluck: i haven't played a single stv event and i think my experience is better for it
[6:12:43] Joryckfree: basically to anyone new that want to play wow either dont or play retail cuz this is terrible
[6:12:44] vitaminhhh: just saw hozi lol
[6:12:47] rinohwow: MAGE BTW haHAA LUL
[6:12:47] r4men_noodle: Time for SF man..
[6:12:57] probeu: i dont really care about the mage aoe stuff bc the event is unplayable lagfest anyways
[6:13:01] djlyftsnusx: @Xaryu check general on discord for positive hospital vibes
[6:13:05] ZiggyMyDude: 3pm is the worst stv for sure
[6:13:07] Zanzanz: @Joryckfree this is such a bad take lol
[6:13:15] LithoSlam: this is fine
[6:13:16] Shekelpvp: you should pick off people a bit further from the altar, ull get so many more coins
[6:13:18] wankels: Rez timer happens if you die to the boss
[6:13:20] ZaanSaidTheSun: "some players" have min/maxxed, meaning only certain classes can do this
[6:13:22] siales19: why always min/max? will I have fun in wow or be able to do all content without researching best in slot gear?
[6:13:23] Copertone: 9 was bas
[6:13:25] Copertone: bad
[6:13:35] toxicity5: 5pm here east coast though
[6:13:36] gloydthewarrior: this makes SoD look so bad Xaryu
[6:13:37] crazbombs1999: face it you wont get this lol
[6:13:41] BroodingDoob: @siales19 you will have fun if you choose to have fun. ignore the doomers in chat
[6:13:46] Shekelpvp: you should pick off people a bit further from the altar, ull get so many more coins
[6:13:46] luzid7: you could take a priest maybe aswell with nova spec
[6:13:48] naturalduck: @joryckfree still don't understand how this stops new players from playing sod lol
[6:13:52] Musmaximus: what is this?
[6:13:52] Uguntinsh: dont spawn on the other mages grp
[6:13:54] rissel: for someone who just got here: what the hell is happening?
[6:13:55] Uguntinsh: be behind them
[6:14:00] Uguntinsh: otherwise u get killed
[6:14:00] luciddreamer2121: wtf is this?
[6:14:00] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree if u are in early 20s u are right, but if u are 26+ you are wrong
[6:14:24] Joryckfree: @serverfirst300003 what does it have to do with age lmao
[6:14:36] carlosantonioar: hhahaha
[6:14:37] morfius09: i think its better to just start blasting if you spawn in the middle of people instead of mass regen first
[6:14:38] Alassianss: @Joryckfree Yea cause retail is so easy to get into right ? and its so fun being lower dps than a tank when u doin content as new player right, and getting yelled at in m+ how bad u are.
[6:14:50] ellgthompson: most classes only need 15/20 coins max, i only needed 7 on my ele shaman, this event isnt the only thing to do in SoD
[6:14:52] realandtruephobe: living flame iceblock on altar?
[6:15:05] Charles_Winston: @Alassianss this is the best experience YEP
[6:15:12] Glennr16: When do you get coins? He didnt get any for that last life

[6:15:19] Pintar34: !followage
[6:15:20] Rampetroll: or if u guys get on top and use blissards
[6:15:21] StreamElements: @Pintar34, pintar34 has been following xaryu for  6 years 7 months 11 days 10 hours
[6:15:23] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree because you look for different things with age, i dont care about zoomish retail with 0 mmo experience, instance pve and pvp i want open world
[6:15:38] sinestro0: running into death endlessly, yep fun
[6:15:41] Kellvig: HUH
[6:15:45] Joryckfree: @Alassianss yes cuz its really easy to go into any raid in sod with stalkers checking ur every step with logs and u have to have BiS for tactic "avoid fire" and spam frostbolt, please next time think bout what u say twice
[6:15:49] israldir: This doesn't seem too fun compared to small scale pvp
[6:15:59] ctrlc__: 300 coins just on that last one haha woah
[6:16:01] dj_efx: im at 2k coins halfwaythru
[6:16:05] feihTV: Fresh shave?
[6:16:08] lurskii: how much coiins u get as 5x mage? xD
[6:16:13] Uguntinsh: you can get 4-5k on this boss spawn.
[6:16:14] v1ll4n0us: I got 4k doing this once at ZG spawn
[6:16:14] Baemare: I've scored 4k coins easy with 5x mage
[6:16:17] zomboio: what is this?
[6:16:17] Alassianss: @Charles_Winston Well for new player yes personally i like retail more as im m+ pusher and i really enjoy hard content more than ''mmo'' felling
[6:16:19] Zanzanz: @Joryckfree join a guild then
[6:16:22] jeneraljelly: @israldir personally did event like once, its super lame lol imo
[6:16:22] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree even that last statement tells me are u are around 20-22 years old. wtf is stalking your gear?
[6:16:23] buddhistredneck: it’s a fun death match mini game
[6:16:24] backstreetalright: hey from Portugal

[6:17:18] naturalduck: Fear is killing u guys
[6:17:20] Payo: what lvl is xaryu in HC
[6:17:22] Joryckfree: @serverfirst300003 bruh wdym u cant get to any raid without people lookin at logs and having no life bis, and no I am older
[6:17:32] Swapzz_: i think its better to just spawn on altar and pump there
[6:17:39] Swapzz_: point is to kill people that are low
[6:17:41] backstreetalright: this lagg is insaneeee
[6:17:41] israldir: @jeneraljelly I did it a couple of times 3-4 days in but lag and layering problems killed the hype for me.. And this does not want me to go back
[6:17:41] Shekelpvp: some of your mages are doing living bomb instead of insta aoeing
[6:17:45] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree ITS NORMAL! its been like that before u were born! if u dont like that play games of your generation!
[6:17:48] Uguntinsh: just spawn in the front corner
[6:17:51] Nekas_Tv: gnutz is triggering me so much
[6:17:54] Uguntinsh: and go altar
[6:17:54] neodude24: How is this event even fun lmao
[6:17:55] realandtruephobe: you definitely lost bloods, you sure you didn't get coins that last life?
[6:17:57] Zanzanz: @Joryckfree join a guild then, youre literally complaining about something that is easily solvable
[6:17:57] Uguntinsh: do like other mages
[6:18:04] Valueacc: gurubussy arena amirite boys?
[6:18:04] Shekelpvp: mb thought so
[6:18:13] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin fuegoVibe
[6:18:14] Rampetroll: would blizzard work?
[6:18:14] Raikot22: whats wrong with living bomb?
[6:18:15] dj_efx: bruh im almost to 3k doing this mage shit
[6:18:16] ellgthompson: i cant stand retail. its got no personality, looks worse than classic imo and 95% of whats in the game/come before a new expac gets completely ignored
[6:18:33] neodude24: SoD is retail
[6:18:34] morfius09: STD gurubussy arena event
[6:18:36] Uguntinsh: just copy other mages spot and spawn behind them
[6:18:44] Uguntinsh: you will be fine
[6:18:44] woad_: Looks so chaotic, and with the boss in the back KEKW
[6:18:47] Joryckfree: @serverfirst300003 uh ? so its normal to what bruh ,  I guess u werent born when i was playing wow back in the days when people played wow for fun and didnt have to max every single thing
[6:18:49] tuberculosislung: @ellgthompson that's your opinion, and no one cares
[6:19:01] dado_inc: Retail is like a smartphone Game ...
[6:19:02] teriko_: wtf are w edoing here
[6:19:13] josefstal55: why is the horde trying to kill the boss?
[6:19:14] Zanzanz: @Joryckfree literally no one is stopping you from doing this except you
[6:19:20] booddhi: maybe just count down from 3
[6:19:21] cosmin284: take care everyone have the best day and night fuegoL fuegoH  <3   and gn have a great rest of the stream on twich with self found hardcore Xaryu
[6:19:22] ARROOCE: @dado_inc yeah this is totally different rn OMEGALUL
[6:19:26] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[6:19:30] ZiggyMyDude: idk how anyone else does stv as a non mage
[6:19:31] Alassianss: @ellgthompson its for differnt kinda players :) Retail offers hard content where u can push your self. Sod / Classic offers community mmo feeling game play but not rly challenge
[6:19:34] backstreetalright: u dont get gear damage xar?
[6:19:38] scoutbeans: gotta time your rez with the other groups
[6:19:40] rook1e_dg: try right side
[6:19:40] Joryckfree: @Zanzanz what are you even talking about classic is unplayable since TBC classic GDKP bullshit
[6:19:47] scoutbeans: make sure you go in when theyre almost done
[6:19:47] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree HAHA i can tell you are lying, ive played mmos way before u were born. U telling me origingal WOTLK didnt have Gear score addon and u had to have 4k to join Ulduar?
[6:19:51] Aldever13: perfectly balanced
[6:19:59] NotoriousTWIG: Surely this is what Aggrend wanted :)
[6:20:09] dado_inc: for me ist SOD the REAL Retail
[6:20:10] Haematopodidae: surely thats not win trading
[6:20:12] Zanzanz: @Joryckfree so youre saying there are 0 guilds in classic just running raids? yeah doubt it, you just wanna be mad to be mad
[6:20:13] Duckduckgoose38: Damn world warper put me in hintherlands lol
[6:20:14] retnuh_92: you know why aliens doesnt mess us because we make them all ugly in movies
[6:20:15] ripwarlock2: Just blink past them onto the side of the altar.. thats the best way
[6:20:16] berni2031: u got killed by the boss 6 times LUL
[6:20:18] tuberculosislung: @Joryckfree keep whining
[6:20:24] chalupacabras: all the fighting on the stadium ramp gives me warlord of draenor intro vibes
[6:20:24] Joryckfree: @serverfirst300003 I ve been leading ICC yes there were GS but there were no logs and all ur stalking pieces of shit addons
[6:20:29] scoutbeans: having the boss right on top is hard too
[6:20:31] JosieFS: mages are going to be the first r14s

[6:23:43] shadofa: coins depend on boss position alot bug 1200 is great
[6:23:49] realandtruephobe: The more AoE spammers there are, the less effective it is. It's self limiting!
[6:23:58] naturalduck: Dbm pull timer syncs up rezzes real well
[6:24:00] CoolTV: you need to position smarter, you dont need to go altar every time, its too crowded imo
[6:24:00] fitzgeraldn: bruh I heard of mage groups getting 5k + copper

[6:27:17] sancho__o: kahdamu is streamsnipin u
[6:27:18] mistahfrank: when you stand at the feet of a boss that deals aoe 10k damage, you tend to die
[6:27:18] Gryphaaa: You literally lead the raid against him lol
[6:27:20] wattrang: is it confirmed that you damage boss more with bruised debuff?
[6:27:21] naturalduck: Blizz hardcoxed target xaryu first
[6:27:24] Elektrotwerk: maybe aggro with aoe
[6:27:24] maniiieelll: devs added a /tar macro on you
[6:27:25] Grocery7: he knows who the r1 players are
[6:27:26] morticianbuera: this is sooooo stupid

[6:27:32] Divulsi: 1500 copper in a single run is kinda wild though
[6:27:41] Camosurfer21: xar i thought this was a family friendly stream
[6:27:41] Genghish: xarWUT

[6:27:57] Elektrotwerk: „pvp“ event
[6:27:58] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree at least here u feel like u doing all the content available, in retail u will never be doing it unless uare in Cutting Edge guild
[6:28:00] Rosster19er: whats the haul so far?
[6:28:05] rook1e_dg: this was a bag run :( it happens
[6:28:07] mangocat40: no way ur doing some goldshire rolepaly rn
[6:28:07] Jvcifer: Looks like really fun gameplay
[6:28:08] realandtruephobe: If boss wasn't on top of altar and just nearby it would work better
[6:28:12] Uguntinsh: you beed to spawn in the corner and do not run in the narnia
[6:28:12] alexgoat94: past full red it deletes your character

[6:28:29] Philopinos: just spawn on grops outside
[6:28:30] Uguntinsh: you are ressing into other grps while they aoe already
[6:28:31] Gruusader: naked survival literally
[6:28:33] morfius09: it would be if youd stop suiciding to khadamu
[6:28:35] tuplin: be on the side - throwing blizzards in there with the boss on the altar would yield way more coins
[6:28:36] scoutbeans: when i got 4k, we always rezzed at spirit. ran in, drank, waited for other mages to be low and then we'd run to altar
[6:28:38] HoppsAlot: How many??
[6:28:40] StunningPaul: You were on pace for 3100 coins after the first 3 minutes
[6:28:42] scoutbeans: but boss also wasn't up our ass on the altar lol

[6:29:17] Joryckfree: @serverfirst300003 content ? what content ur doing here so pvp is this running with red equip to event and spam arcane nova and then u r in gnomeregan which is dungeon for disabled people that have to have bis cuz spamming frostbolt is too hard for their brain

[6:29:38] Gruusader: I always go for the gnome tbh
[6:29:39] asloff: good to know
[6:29:41] Shakezulah22: @joryckfree you're really mad
[6:29:46] Polarlord91: this is so stupid, my paladin can barley get 100 coins during these events and mages be here like oh this is easy getting 1k + on easy moide
[6:29:46] BlownFuse_: Meanwhile i barely got 300 on my lock lol
[6:29:52] Joryckfree: @Shakezulah22 I m quite chill tbh

[6:30:35] Cjpriest: @wattrang not even close lol it was tested and confirmed way before that even happened
[6:30:35] vsetaq: is this season of discovery?
[6:30:36] serverfirst300003: @Joryckfree but it has less barrier to entry and u do all of it, in retail you really do need a guild to be able to do the highest level of content and u for sure need something to show for it to get into it
[6:30:41] Duckduckgoose38: Died 10 times new record
[6:30:44] hades_the_dkgod11: mr @Xaryu where is mitch jones???

[6:30:57] Texie2k: remove mage

[6:31:15] enigmasvea: reduce AoE dmg around altars @Xaryu YEP
