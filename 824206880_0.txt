[0:24:53] MEAT__SLAP: @ZyntosAran any recommendations like just pay the sub fee and later buy shadows when im lvl 60 and know how to play
[0:24:55] darKanthony3: modzWIDEL modzWIDER
[0:24:56] BRUTALIT0PS: @ZyntosAran You're right, I forgot they changed that recently.

[0:25:02] Bl4ckSauce: asmonFiend
[0:25:03] mrpresbaby: do honor quests in bg count towards the 1500?

[0:25:15] Mordeaur: I heard there's a mount that u can use in maw. Is that one hard to get?
[0:25:25] darKanthony3: modzFLEXL modzLAUGH modzFLEXR
[0:25:31] BRUTALIT0PS: You won't be able to get to 60 without Shadowlands. You would not be allowed to go past level 50 I believe.
[0:25:32] jerexify: @BTiZZY_ Right?? It's insane how fast this marathon went by... @Towelliee As always, though, it's been freaking awesome!
[0:25:38] ZyntosAran: @ben_bingley yeah, I would, as a new player, recommend to just use the trial until level 20, then sub to play to 50, and if you then want to continue, buy the exp
[0:25:50] MEAT__SLAP: @BTiZZY_ already did that im maxed out at 20
[0:25:54] Nylzyo: Im missing 1 Soul for my Animahingy to upgrade it. How can do get more besides the weekly? OO
[0:26:08] Lostdogal: @ZyntosAran just get shadowlands, the new player experience is way better

[0:26:27] DokaDoxy: i hate torghast its awful
[0:26:27] Doomster59: i hate the maw
[0:26:27] jarilrpg: #bringbackflightwhistle

[0:27:25] Deflexure: The launch was rough but xpac is good. When I finally was able to start leveling you were the only person I saw in The Maw lol
[0:27:27] KPable: Did tourgast yesterday on my hunter nad loved it
[0:27:30] Crowzcut: towel do side quests you get more world quests
[0:27:31] ZyntosAran: @Lostdogal yeah, just play to 50, get comfortable with the game, and then start the exp
[0:27:40] MaddyLif3: anyone else think that towelliee with the gunnars on looks like the manager from Big Time Rush?
[0:27:42] BRUTALIT0PS: I am still level 51 LUL
[0:27:43] garmin1987: i had that earlier in 2 difernent mythics
[0:27:47] Sionz: Do you think there will be a "burnout" issue with M+ with only 8 dungeons?
[0:27:47] ExpoUhl: People that leave are the worst.
[0:27:49] tezrelli: just move legendary drops to the last boss
[0:27:49] Psychedelikzz: people do that to themselves :D
[0:27:50] Naturalbeef: I actually don't mind the Maw.
[0:27:52] 00esm00: i literally cant learn to tank in this game in general by making and new tanks without getting flak or toxic people

[0:28:05] TheItalianStallion321: cant wait for raider.IO to come back out next week @Towelliee
[0:28:05] yunggluten: there needs to be a harsher penalty for people leaving dungeons
[0:28:06] TheDuck0nQuack: there should be a penatly
[0:28:16] aspiration89: LUL
[0:28:17] Apheelia: I hate when people leave! I stay even if Im losing
[0:28:17] Incredible_Sausage: tanks shouldn't get to bounce like that without a huge dungeon debuff
[0:28:25] KPable: I will report those people and hope blizzard does something about it
[0:28:26] Kinghorn: 👃 👈
[0:28:48] Thoreya: whats wrong with SL rn?
[0:28:54] Frostfury: Not being shallow or anything but would you rather save time while grinding? Then again HC now only takes like 10-15 mins which is nothing
[0:28:55] Deflexure: Per nerf cata heroics were lowkey fun though
[0:28:57] Warganizer2091: is pvp broken? or am I supposed to have 20k hp and get hit with 12k aimed shots and 7k judgements
[0:28:57] ExpoUhl: Leaver penalty solves everything.
[0:29:00] Deflexure: Pre-nerf*
[0:29:06] Chiraakitteh: And omg, healing sucked at the start of cata
[0:29:14] oggokogok: @Towelliee I also think that they might just be wrapping that stuff up into the, almost inevitable, pre-raid balancing patch
[0:29:17] DecayedmiNt: @Warganizer2091 Welcome to 2020 PvP bro, enjoy.
[0:29:18] Kinghorn: people leaving dungeons after their boss doesnt drop their conduit/memory @Thoreya
[0:29:22] bad_fish_too: WutFace
[0:29:23] aspiration89: Go docks
[0:29:23] Fireahwk: Starting SL in 4 weeks, maybe its fixed before that

[0:29:30] TexValhalla: fuck this bg
[0:29:32] jimmytingus: what talent you running in row 1 towlie?
[0:29:38] Moondagger98: Either put legendaries on last boss or just make them 100%, what's the point in them not being 100%. Most people will just get them next week with M+ anyway.
[0:29:38] AcidSyndicate: go in tower defend the base
[0:29:38] boomsitick: Which dungeons have anima quests?
[0:29:39] josh8555: gotta stack versatility probably for pvp
[0:30:03] NoWaayMan: there needs to be a leaver penalty even if you finish the first boss
[0:30:14] Warganizer2091: @synthetiktek I guess so
[0:30:21] wwwyzzerd: goxul in torghast, fucker is bugged
[0:30:35] javlini: Id say they need to fix sub rogue, arena unplayeable
[0:30:39] TheLoho: @wwwyzzerd how is he bugged?
[0:30:43] oggokogok: Oh yeah, I was just referring to moving the legendary items to last bosses, that's not quite as simple as a hotfix, I'm assuming. @Towelliee
[0:30:46] br0fest0r: imo they should make legendaries be able to be reforged with stats/slots, just put the old leggo in and the missives/slot item
[0:30:46] DokaDoxy: today in maw i jump on big rock between 2 rocks and i got perma dc untill i die and get back to base i hate maw so much
[0:31:00] DecayedmiNt: @Warganizer2091 But yeah, you gotta vers stack for PvP.

[0:34:23] Arktos99: now you run in a circle around the alliance keep and lose
[0:34:29] aspiration89: And keep someone at docks for glaive respawns if they happen to go down
[0:34:39] Reynolds95: he tried

[0:36:07] bad_fish_too: Havoc is pretty weak rn
[0:36:14] oggokogok: @JayD_92 I'm not exactly a main but they're solid, if unspectacular. Their single target seems a bit low but the AE is still pretty good
[0:36:40] JayD_92: Any recommendations on non-hunter DPS if DH isn't that good rn?
[0:36:52] Naithos_: @JayD_92 If you want melee, sub rogue is pretty good

[0:48:53] tdpark_: I level my alt from 51-60 thru mining and herb,average 90mins per level
[0:48:53] atherieel: @mayonaes Any lego memory can drop for any spec of ur class
[0:48:55] Sepron14: @mayonaes Any can drop mate
[0:48:55] thiccsushi: its random @mayonaes just like conduit drops i keep getting the other specs
[0:49:06] PleaseeStop: why was someone else on your stream earlier?
[0:49:06] MisterTwizZy: @mayonaes I believe it drops based on class and not spec
[0:49:07] Voidheim: what I really wish Blizzard would do is punish players that leave dungeon runs right after the boss that has their Lego on it, dies.
[0:49:09] mayonaes: perfect thanks everyone
[0:49:17] Karn1987: @Towelliee i just used 50k point for water
[0:49:19] Vigi9413: imagine getting a leaver in m+ after a lego drop... I would rage
[0:49:20] Doomster59: heroic dungeons with lfg are unplayable right now
[0:49:25] JayBinski: I did threads as a brewmaster and leveled in like 15 hours, was amazing
[0:49:37] roflpotamus: facts
[0:49:39] Moondagger98: Blame blizzard not the person leaving tbh
[0:49:46] drprofessorfarnsworth: @Voidheim 100% agree. 24-hr dungeon lock would be good imo
[0:49:47] Naturalbeef: Simple solution, if you want to speed level then don't choose Threads of Fate
[0:49:50] ClubsSC: threads of fate is a fantastic system it just needs some tweaks
[0:49:50] MisterElectric: and he has so much data to support his passions
[0:49:53] its_andyd: did u hear the zappos ceo died in a fire?
[0:49:56] Voidheim: @sportsmediclxxxvii agreed
[0:49:58] TryAtomic: Des out here doin the lords work
[0:50:01] Zastrow_DM: @JayBinski well 15 hours is super slow
[0:50:03] Gnash84: Im doing threads as a WW monk and it seems on par with campaign. Im 59

[0:50:27] Vigi9413: threads seems like it would be slow going solo idk
[0:50:36] Vigi9413: I think I'm just gonna redo the story
[0:50:37] JayBinski: @Zastrow_DM if you say so, it was a chill day of queuing and watching stream

[0:50:44] thiccsushi: I did mine solo and was able to get from 50 to 60 in 2 days
[0:50:47] PleaseeStop: Threads of fate is great, it's just enough as you complete the side quests.
[0:50:50] sharie: solo question replaying the story is better imo
[0:50:52] pk99: redo the story so i don't have to think while I level
[0:51:05] ClubsSC: yep, just a small tweak and it'll be perfect
[0:51:07] MethmM: threads isfine as u can lvl to 59 and sum normally and do threads to skip the rest of the campaign
[0:51:07] Vigi9413: redoing the story takes like 7 hours ezpz
[0:51:14] GorSTL: redo the story until you can switch back to threads of fate to finish 60
[0:51:31] quakegoogl: grubBae
[0:51:43] metavahn231: alliance can camp maw all day but they are so bad in epic bg's
[0:51:45] Matobo_GG: My only complaint is Maw, No flight Whistle, and Long flight paths do to the nature of Oribos.
[0:51:46] Etines4: I did it solo, took me less than a day and you get to renown 3 when leveling
[0:51:51] remixonfire91: took me like 5h on dps spamming dungeons
[0:51:51] kaseguii: Yea i'm spamming dungeons as a healer and it's so fast
[0:51:54] noxitall: yeah having to kill 100 creatures to finish the bonus is quite much
[0:51:54] Moondagger98: Dungeons are fast if you're tank/heals or in a group yea, with or without threads
[0:51:56] wwwyzzerd: even as dps it was quick ques
[0:51:58] JackertonPlays: my spriest i am leveling only waits like 3 mins for a que pop
[0:51:59] Vigi9413: us dps don't get that benefit lol
[0:52:00] Nerendis: Got my prot pally to 53 in maybe 2 hours just chilling in dungeons. It slaps
[0:52:07] Hybridwarhawk: That's how im leveling my druid is spam healing dungeons
[0:52:07] PleaseeStop: @marconram there is an item to teleport you back to the sanctuary there from anywhere in the maw.
[0:52:16] mo197: get em towel
[0:52:22] eternal_light41: @towelliee do you know there is a 180 Two Handed Sword that you can get for free for your Blood DK Bahjeea made a vid of it
[0:52:27] Naithos_: So the 50-60 way to go right now seems to be follow the story until you're almost 60, then swap to Threads and finish it?
[0:52:31] Vigi9413: can you spam dungeons and then activate threads of fate at like 58-59?
[0:52:40] Moondagger98: @DeimosG For speed? Ye.
[0:52:44] quakegoogl: towBeer grubBae
[0:52:48] griffdog125: I was on my dru healer with your dk towel. dung n doing world objectives went quick with group
[0:52:49] MrGattz: wow its so dark in maldraxxus
[0:52:50] quakegoogl: ruyuF towBeer grubBae
[0:52:54] Moondagger98: You can activate threads of fate at any time you just can't switch back
[0:52:56] JayBinski: @Towelliee it took me like 15 hours as brewmaster and I was just queueing casually while working and watching streams, was pretty sweet
[0:52:59] kakyke: i need help picking professions any suggestions for class specific
[0:53:09] metavahn231: attackers seem to always win in this
[0:53:15] metavahn231: nobody wants to defend
[0:53:23] Naithos_: @Moondagger98 Gotcha, thanks. Been doing Threads solo lately and found that it was rather slow unless I was also doing dungeons
[0:53:33] quakegoogl: ruyuF grubBae
[0:53:49] Vigi9413: but i'd have to restore my shield and that's precious leveling time Kappa
[0:53:57] billybaroo1: prot levels as fast as dps?
[0:53:58] Moondagger98: Yea threads is slow and boring imo, so I just don't bother until the end.
[0:53:59] oggokogok: I did about 2/3 of my Threads of Fate levelling solo doing bonus objectives and the like and while I do think that they should increase the percentage per mob/item I didn't find it particularly slow
[0:54:32] metavahn231: windwalker can just run away lol
[0:54:34] Vigi9413: Let's just bring back Glad Stance warriors and call it done
[0:54:38] mo197: zerg
[0:54:38] griffdog125: @oggokogok depends on class
[0:54:43] Moondagger98: I mean overall, it doesn't take long to do the 50-60 stretch at all so doesn't matter that much
[0:54:44] foxdie889: The Horde is goddamn dumb when it comes to this BG
[0:54:58] Boioioioing: Tank/healer queues. That’s how dad did it! That’s how America does is! And it’s worked out pretty good so far.
[0:55:05] its_andyd: i cant believe towelliee made it onto www.neatgang.com
[0:55:13] oggokogok: @boomeranng125 I was doing it as guardian, I was just doing it when I didn't want to commit to doing dungeons so I could afk fast
[0:55:16] mrpresbaby: the honor from a loss doesn't count towards 1500
[0:55:17] Moondagger98: Took me like 8 hours to level 50-60 at launch without any previous knowledge of zones.

[1:21:36] thrillersan: is there a way to know the counter to the torghast boss? me and my buddy couldn't kill one last night
[1:21:51] Molvonos: @thrillersan Lots of bosses. Which did you run into?
[1:21:55] Sanctitas: it was hilariously long
[1:21:58] PizaPoward: torghast bosses are literally insane at layer 3.
[1:21:59] KittyRhage: Morning @Towelliee and chat
[1:22:09] kailith: I don't know if I want to gear anymore...my ilevel is 169.69...it's really nice...
[1:22:12] golli9: check wowhead for boss abilities and counters
[1:22:26] luffar3n: @KittyRhage evening bo!
[1:22:57] Ipodxx: Depends which one you have
[1:23:00] manhunni: 20 seconds if the 1shot boss comes to play
[1:23:01] chronoit: like what traits to pick to beat them
[1:23:06] thrillersan: @thrillersan don't remember the boss name but two orbs came from us and then they would absorb it into a shield
[1:23:09] chronoit: before you get there?
[1:23:15] DrakhanGaming: only pick up dps powers in torg
[1:23:21] foxies_havocing: there is a rng on finding a follower in torghast or did I miss him?
[1:23:21] Solid0Liquid: he means a strat
[1:23:25] averis12: towCry towCry towCry towCry towCry marathon forever imo
[1:23:28] eyeman: Its random
[1:23:33] northcub: do you get more Soul Ash if you complete Torghast multiple times?
[1:23:35] Pillsbury_Doughboy: I'm a mage so I just hero and lawl
[1:23:41] Exigaet: It's random, you can't really go for a strat
[1:23:47] Exigaet: You pick what you're given
[1:23:50] wwwyzzerd: as a hunter i stack tar trap, makes melee bosses aa breeze
[1:23:52] Molvonos: Also, on level 3 (merchant layer), you can see a hologram of the boss on level 6, so you can build appropriately.
[1:23:54] KittyRhage: I am a shadow priest so I just sit in a corner and cry
[1:23:55] Boioioioing: Just play a disc priest. EZ
[1:24:09] golli9: wait in the vendor bubble while you look up the boss on wowhead and figure out what anima powers you might want to buy, and what strategy you want to use
[1:24:13] thrillersan: he was just gaining an absorb shield that we couldn't break through at the 40% mark
[1:24:15] 00esm00: the +2000% for arcane mage is insane

[1:24:49] PizaPoward: honestly DPS and if you really feel squishy pick up some defensive orbs. focus on always getting as many of the orbs as possible. spending an extra 40+ minutes clearing every floor is better then spending the entire day retrying the same dungeon
[1:24:50] atherieel: Think of Torghast kind of like a rogue like game of it's own and don't pick things that you basicly will never use or don
[1:24:53] wwwyzzerd: oh Thrillersan you talkin about goxul, yeh hes bugged
[1:24:58] northcub: do you get more Soul Ash if you complete Torghast multiple times?

[3:20:03] Slowkill333: @Slowkill333 I understand that...I am just saying an alternative could have been to do longer ad breaks but at a bigger interval.
[3:20:06] Kableiz: @Aidler hey, thats you. I wasn't implying anything D:
[3:20:17] Amerra: how many hours you required to stream

[3:20:32] Fl3tchTTV: @CrimsonNurse With relation to my gripe, I have no problem seeing ads. I like that hes getting revenue from ads. I hate that Twitch's system is so bad that the ads freeze the stream and reloading make me watch prerolls. again. nothing on Toweliee

[3:34:48] BlackAngelxD: I was grinding all last night not a single drop of legos or gear for me.
[3:34:50] Luceinn: The same thing has happened on my pally...It is like they want me to heal
[3:34:51] dreaamonn: @Towelliee What classes do you think are gona get hit with the nerf stick
[3:34:57] iDazidan: is holy sigil any good?
[3:34:58] theDirtyon3: Lore is scared to stay here for more than 5 minutes though LUL
[3:35:02] Amarlian: https://www.wowhead.com/news=319629/legendary-powers-from-shadowlands-dungeons-hotfix-better-droprates-from-higher-d
[3:35:05] theDirtyon3: right now at least
[3:35:08] schlongconnery39: @Towelliee who is our favorite class to play so far?
[3:35:13] XshadowturkeyX: they nincreased the drop rates toiday in a hotfix
[3:35:17] Amarlian: last thing they said about legendaries but that is for dungeons
[3:35:20] Vexnya: @Nelinde no because memories only come from predetermined drops locations, you know exactly what can drop from who/where
[3:35:35] Scruffy_Robot: They should be if torghast are 100%
[3:35:36] Vexnya: @Nelinde only rng is whether they actually drop from the boss at the time
[3:36:04] Crowzcut: world bosses are 100% towel
[3:36:29] Crowzcut: yes
[3:36:38] Vexnya: any powers that drop from something on a rotation is 100% drop
[3:36:53] Hybridwarhawk: I could see them doing that for mythic @ 100% drop; lower for heroic/normal
[3:36:55] Vexnya: or at least sop far that is who it is set up
[3:37:05] Vexnya: how*
[3:37:11] obabathundae: Oo
[3:37:13] Tupacthuglyf: I don't see a world where sire legendaries arent 100% drop rates lol
[3:37:21] Scruffy_Robot: 100% lfr drop rate
[3:37:23] HaxzorJimDuggan: you only get one shot per difficulty in a raid, but dungeons have much more chances
[3:37:36] Shok1597: That was never guarunteed. Just that the less repeatable the content the higher the chance of dropping 100% has never been confirmed
[3:37:39] headsh0t676: did he change swearters?
[3:37:43] HaxzorJimDuggan: it needs to be a high drop rate for sure
[3:37:53] Zastrow_DM: can legendaries drop from normal dungeons evben? or just heroics?
[3:38:04] HaxzorJimDuggan: ive seen legendaries in normals
[3:38:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: rare but it happens
[3:38:16] obabathundae: towSalt
[3:38:18] phasedtvz: Nah 50/50 for mythic raiding would be enough
[3:38:24] Vexnya: they can drop regardless of difficulty
[3:38:24] TheOGMed: I got my BiS legendary in a normal
[3:38:38] Mcbeave: Having to kill Stone Legion for my only good legendary on BDK is asinine. Especially if its not close to 100% drop. lol
[3:38:46] Ustakkad: lol
[3:39:04] shmasherd: Im collecting all the legendaries for the specs I dont play first. Or atleast thats what blizzard has decided
[3:39:14] northcub: how can you tell what Mythics you are locked out on?
[3:39:16] jenfinite: same @shmasherd
[3:39:22] Vexnya: my BiS comes from Council of Blood
[3:39:38] obabathundae: i got all frost DK legos available >.< 0 for unholy
[3:39:47] Zomgboy: my bis drops from a thorgast layer
[3:39:51] Zomgboy: which is in 1-2 weeks
[3:39:57] dreaamonn: @Towelliee Who do you think is going to get nerfed?
[3:39:59] Vexnya: at least it is guarenteed
[3:40:05] onous_: therealonous subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Final Day? Bro do you even lift anymore? j/k much love for ya T-man.
[3:40:14] Kromede: why stop at 2?
[3:40:24] akleb: I go back to work in 1 hour after 1 week off grinding shadowlands and watching this marathon. its been a pleasure
[3:40:27] golli9: If you go to wowhead it will tell you what boss drops the legendary you want. If you get a holy leggo when you wanted prot, then run the boss who drops the prot leggo instead of the holy one.
[3:40:40] smoke1x2knight: your chair might still have that terry loot luck

[3:42:20] aksel______: so im sjilling no grind for me
[3:42:34] CrimsonNurse: towRed towPurple towGreen towBlue
[3:42:38] Vexnya: @golli9 that's not the point, the only gripe is the idea that running the boss you need never drops the one it has that you want, but you egt "lucky" and get a useless one that has the same chance
[3:42:58] monkstarztv: i gotten 4 them already still need to finish current torghast for that one too i think
[3:43:07] Ryok: you all are lucky, my 2 best legos come from the last 2 bosses of the raid xD
[3:43:13] YungDizzY: Can we solo Antorus yet?
[3:43:20] br0fest0r: push, push it real good!

[3:59:42] Vexnya: I really don't think prot warrior is that bad
[4:00:14] Throdio: If Blizzard said for leggos what they said for covenants, where they will nerf if needed, but will stay the best. Would you craft on your pally?
[4:00:28] trivwik: @Vexnya They aren't, they are just not god tier like BFA
[4:00:39] Mitchasoar: should i create the lego on a lower costs helm and then upgrade or spend the 230k on the highest ilvl in ah?
[4:00:40] Solid0Liquid: hey chat.... we can only get 3 renown a week right?
[4:01:05] hunterxp: 35% chance of a instant reset is pretty POG

[4:01:24] hunterxp: OH damn
[4:01:24] Vexnya: @TRIVforVendetta honestly, i feel like overall tanking is in a good spot where none of them are bad it seems, some might not be top tier, but they are all in an okay spot at least
[4:01:29] Bammbino: @Towelliee Were you just talking about headsets? What brand?
[4:01:32] Thadune: @Towelliee Sloot said he is leaning towards the Holy Avenger one
