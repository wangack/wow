[0:38:38] rns_aurelius: earth shield being on the same slot as sham rage makes it unusable
[0:38:41] Tropicocity: resto shaman is just a mana battery

[0:40:04] bletso: guzuBeliever
[0:40:06] Mr_Moffert: PepoG
[0:40:07] 3Brick_: @Yvernaa Shaman needs either options for instant heals or casttime reduction
[0:40:10] Modebc: Do shaman healers even have aoe heal?

[0:44:26] Deliverererer: love the idea, hate the execution of mythic plus
[0:44:27] IFallDownLadders: Just make them give bloodmoon coins instead of loot, would be a neat way to get some coins alternatively
[0:44:31] Magdelia: YEP calling blizzard police
[0:44:32] wednesdayb: i do dislike timers
[0:44:34] twitchforgotmyaccount: One of the big draws in classic is that the gear is relatively straightforward. You can't just tweak ilvl in classic like you can in retail
[0:44:34] NamaWoW: ascension is VERY different in gameplay, way faster paced than normal classic
[0:44:35] Petrichorx_x: pls no I hate the timer
[0:44:36] flowerpew: classic is about logging once 6 months YEP

[0:44:46] lesdruides: Ascension is a mess tho
[0:44:52] Celix_TV: warriors needs a buff, its ridiculios if you compare other classes...
[0:45:03] Pazul2: maybe it can be combined with some kind of pvp rep so u dont get direct upgrades but can still challenge yourself
[0:45:07] cosca420: that asention server, is it free??
[0:45:19] stackladder_: In ascension you can get level 1000 like wtf
[0:45:22] vivimaus: i like the alpha beta gama dungons in lk

[1:23:52] EnigmaticHD: rage bating
[1:23:52] flowerpew: @guzu there were a lot of people who were also not happy, and claimed its classic minus. they quieted down, but they were there
[1:23:55] Mr_Moffert: Smilee
[1:23:56] Nikoftz27: Ogre
[1:23:57] Parshce: NOT REALLY MATE
[1:23:59] viciouswx: This dude buys gold for sure
[1:23:59] Lorrot: If people didnt like the SOD presentation its because they were on heavy doses of copium that Blizzard was announcing classic plus
[1:23:59] YlaWoW: Just one loud guy screaming noooooo at the start of all the hype :P
[1:24:00] Parshce: NOT REALLY

[1:24:10] kasploup: "Its not classic plus cause its not called classic plus HUUHUUuuUUuUuu"
[1:24:12] eddie_nator: very mid take
[1:24:12] Exusprime: @guzu your a super optimistic streamer. however among classic andys they were pissed at sod annoucement
[1:24:13] largist_: He is VERY one sided
[1:24:13] TheWhiteRabbitxX: Well, you also have to consider the people that pay that much money to go to Biscom. Of course they’re gonna be very invested in blizzard.
[1:24:18] mordiell: by constantly jabbing
[1:24:18] ClyroTV: This guy is being the OneGuy
[1:24:19] twitchforgotmyaccount: The "Classic-" was mostly just a joke, wasn't it?
[1:24:21] TheWhiteRabbitxX: blizzcon
[1:24:23] zen0vae: idk i ate up the content and went back to retail
[1:24:28] bagelbiites: I love SOD it’s been the most fun I’ve had in wow in a LONG time

[1:24:38] Fatal_Flaw: the gameplay streams they let you guys do really sold me
[1:24:40] twitchforgotmyaccount: Dunno, iirc people were hyped from the start
[1:24:44] Ari0n0s: NODDERS
[1:24:45] TheWhiteRabbitxX: People just don’t trust blizzard anymore. That’s the only thing.
[1:24:50] ArjanaEU: The initial annoucement was dogshit, the panel made it good:D
[1:24:50] 3Brick_: D: HE LIED
[1:24:52] Rizosio: @bagelbiites amen
[1:24:57] Parshce: Yeah, understandably so, the initial announcement was a bit meh so people were on the fence. Once that longer breakdown came out we got hyped

[1:29:55] Ciaaattt: DvaAss Looking true
[1:29:55] darkpwnz: its one day phase and game is over LUK
[1:29:56] EnigmaticHD: just a little too long... like.. a few weeks too long
[1:29:57] Murkyx: DvaAss
[1:30:00] asddyo: For me im having fun in bgs
[1:30:01] zen0vae: leveling up is the best content right now
[1:30:02] adam_brisbane: isnt that what games are meant to be
[1:30:03] NamaWoW: @viciouswx damn
[1:30:03] Nunadaaa: @viciouswx Seems probable
[1:30:04] Ari0n0s: Okay but , would you not burn out just as fast if they gave everything at once?
[1:30:04] YzieGG: normaly a lot end after 2 weeks anyway
[1:30:05] spicycannelle: wayyy too long
[1:30:05] nsoriano13: The casual players are able to level up with not having to play catchup to end game @Guzu Like someone who doesnt play everyday
[1:30:07] alexander_skryabin: DvaAss Looking i'm pretty long rn
[1:30:08] Nunadaaa: $8ball is stackladder in bed
[1:30:08] Supibot: nunadaaa, 😐 Reply hazy, try again.
[1:30:10] Aegis_2566: DvaAss Looking *hears muffled mumbling*
[1:30:12] Seline88: In a way, it's kinda like retail, you play the patch (phase)
[1:30:13] Nunadaaa: hmjj
[1:30:14] bagelbiites: people don’t realize there’s  so much stuff to do in the game other than grind pre raid bis and raid
[1:30:16] specialkidmiles: it's because the average player is slow
[1:30:18] Asmii: DvaAss Looking uhhuh melee hunter
[1:30:18] Horfent: I think people should learn to play casually instead of sweatlording
[1:30:22] Wildere: Its okay to stop a a few weeks?
[1:30:22] Mordach1er: I mean normal people like me, enjoy the phase I'm only lvl 36 on my main
[1:30:24] TheWhiteRabbitxX: there are wayyyy more people that play casually though that aren’t vocal and still aren’t 49 in phase 2
[1:30:24] EnigmaticHD: 2-3 weeks less would have been perfect
[1:30:25] poggersshaman: this man is so bald
[1:30:28] kingdulli: how can you appeal to the players who hyper rush to end game content though? have to appeal to casuals. they pay the bills
[1:30:31] Parshce: I can’t do regular BFD anymore, it’s so boring in comparison om
[1:30:32] Infrantic: Such a sweaty take
[1:30:33] TheWhiteRabbitxX: 40*
[1:30:38] R3tty_: TRUE BFD was too hard
[1:30:42] craftyz420: I quite liked it being long, let me experience most the new classes and choose my pt2 main
[1:30:42] Nunadaaa: @specialkidmiles well stop catering the game to dads who work 5 jobs and sleep 3 hours and have 2 hours a month to play
[1:30:43] mordiell: i think we need to normalizi not playing wow 24/7 throughout the whole phase/expansion
[1:30:47] bearfukuu: Nerf Gnomer NOW Madge
[1:30:48] Aegis_2566: DvaAss Looking yes i agree
[1:30:48] nsoriano13: They geared it to the casuals
[1:30:49] Sheppp: @stackladder_ hit the hay
[1:30:53] mordiell: just because you dont play for the whole thing doesnt mean its bad
[1:30:56] DeathToad007: you plaa y for a living
[1:30:58] rustycans: the whole point of seasons is you play and then you stop, some time pass and you come back
[1:30:58] Ari0n0s: NODDERS mordiell
[1:30:59] Nunadaaa: for me it was like 6 weeks too long at least
[1:30:59] Nunadaaa: omE
[1:31:02] viciouswx: It was perfect for me, I have full time job and 2 kids
[1:31:03] adam_brisbane: it was a holiday period as well
[1:31:03] Rosster19er: @mordiell this
[1:31:04] Yvernaa: quantHmm
[1:31:07] StreamElements: Follow my Twitter, NOW! Madge https://www.twitter.com/guzuTV
[1:31:07] Dawir0601: 4 hours a day is casual player
[1:31:11] 21bender21: My main is 21..
[1:31:11] victorthevictoriousv: but maybe now its gonna be better when the lvl is higheR?
[1:31:12] nsoriano13: At this phase it is, but not 40+ phases @Guzu
[1:31:15] specialkidmiles: @Nunadaaa That's the vast majority of classic gamers I bet om
[1:31:15] TheWhiteRabbitxX: @mordiell yes exactly. people that do that are like 1% of the player base just the only ones on stream though so ppl think it’s normal
[1:31:17] YzieGG: every retail phase is way longer
[1:31:18] 21bender21: But I get distracted by ow alot
[1:31:21] spicycannelle: especially if you consider casual players dont have like 10 characters so
[1:31:24] Nunadaaa: @specialkidmiles dont care omE
[1:31:26] Yahyawow: I imagine getting the balance between the hardcore grinders and the casual players is kinda hard
[1:31:27] Parshce: I think it was a couple weeks too long, but it wasn’t even close to Ulduar phase levels of long
[1:31:31] rns_aurelius: am I the only one who just takes a break when I get bored? in p1 I left for a month played other things and came back for p2 and I expect to do the same soon
[1:31:31] bagelbiites: i played a lot and I think it was a fine amount of time, there’s a ton of stuff to do in the game other than get gear and raid
[1:31:32] Genghish: Just reroll faction
[1:31:32] Infrantic: @Dawir0601 Playing 4 hours EVERY SINGLE DAY is not casual
[1:31:35] specialkidmiles: well fricc you Nunadaaa
[1:31:36] zen0vae: nice to be able to keep up with wow and play other games too
[1:31:39] nsoriano13: Leveling will get grindy again once you hit in the 40+ levels. So it makes sense. @Guzu
[1:31:40] Zappy_: i stopped after 1 week after hitting 25
[1:31:41] Nunadaaa: tbh guzu I like that its been a week and youre already back to variety
[1:31:47] Nunadaaa: @specialkidmiles no friccu
[1:31:47] rullehjem: Ulduar Aware
[1:31:49] Yvernaa: Riot MMO is gonna save us all elmoFire
[1:31:50] rullehjem: ICC Aware
[1:31:54] CamGG__: phase 1 was pretty incredible, but I think that 1-25 experience is pretty special in classic. 25-40 kind of a tease.
[1:31:55] Exilox: ppl have to accept that wow is becoming a seasonal game
[1:31:57] Lybra7: that evergreen game is called Earth online
[1:31:59] Nunadaaa: god yes I cant wait for my grandkids to play riot MMO
[1:32:00] specialkidmiles: FeelsGoodMan
[1:32:04] ketiroa: @Yvernaa COPIUM
[1:32:04] bearfukuu: @Dawir0601 4 hours a day is not casual lmao. That's semi-hardcore
[1:32:04] Exilox: you play your season an w8 for next
[1:32:09] NamaWoW: @Nunadaaa KEKW
[1:32:09] Kiroxx: 14 weeks

[1:32:13] Kiroxx: is perfect
[1:32:16] Magdelia: @Yvernaa foxyCopium
[1:32:16] EnigmaticHD: @Nunadaaa I am a dad gamer who plays like 7 hours a week and I had PLENTY of time so I kind of agree... even I think the phase was a little long
[1:32:17] pwnage4me4free: yeah is good
[1:32:20] spicycannelle: 8 weeks
[1:32:23] YlaWoW: Give the devs the time to develop the rest of the game...
[1:32:25] Dawir0601: i was joking guys because he plays 4 hours a day on stream
[1:32:27] Nunadaaa: @EnigmaticHD Prayge thankss dad gamer
[1:32:27] Lybra7: @Yvernaa COPIUM
[1:32:31] ChiefMango: you have to give time for people, casuals, to play alts as well
[1:32:31] Yvernaa: quantHmph
[1:32:35] Kiroxx: ah fk sorry, meant 10 weeks :D
[1:32:35] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I actually haven’t even leveled to 40… I have a job now and a social life.. like I don’t make games my life anymore. it’s called growing up sstvHa sstvLOVE
[1:32:37] largist_: The older I get the more I enjoy games that respect my time and gives chances to ease on playing every now and then, sod does this quite well
[1:32:42] SuperLSDUnicorn: @Yvernaa hugg

[1:32:57] Nunadaaa: pepeD dust to dust
[1:32:57] bearfukuu: @ChiefMango Casuals should not have alts if they don't have enough time to play. Play one char if you are limited on time.
[1:32:59] Fwonks: this video is still going?
[1:33:01] Parshce: I’m gonna miss the chat spam for Kelris om
[1:33:03] specialkidmiles: bait

[1:33:06] CamGG__: such a bad take

[1:33:23] viciouswx: AND STAY DEAD
[1:33:27] Kazay1998: @Parshce We need a song for Thermaplugg as well
[1:33:28] EnigmaticHD: @TheWhiteRabbitxX You can make time for your hobbies if that is what you wanna do. If you aren't doing that it's just not as interesting to you anymore.. which is fine.
[1:33:29] JariMurhapuro: im 46 and i hit 40 this week
[1:33:31] Kazay1998: Like there was for Kelris
[1:33:31] BALtaram: wait, I wasn't grown up all this time? GOWAY
[1:33:32] Ciaaattt: growing up = stop having fun? XDD
[1:33:33] lillebrorr: A huge part of the "games being better before" is also because of overstimulation and nostalgia
[1:33:37] Clinsure: I just don't like the levling part of Classic
[1:33:43] crainiam: being adult means you can't have fun 4Head
[1:33:45] TheWhiteRabbitxX: I agree. but the ones that grind hard forever are making casuals feel pressured
[1:33:46] Fwonks: games are fun, more fun than work
[1:33:49] ClyroTV: I enjoyed BFD but I detest Gnomer I actually don't want to do it
[1:33:50] nsoriano13: Do what you like to do @adam_brisbane
[1:33:51] EnigmaticHD: what a boomer take
[1:33:55] Parshce: “it’s called growing up” there’s not one definitive way to spend your time “maturely”, that’d be so boring om
[1:33:55] Chlamydious: damn bro, guess i better throw my pc away because im above 16

[2:51:48] Blufootgaming: we can spend days criticizing your actions, i think chat would love this
[2:51:50] Huertix: how long to beat site says main+extra 106 hours
[2:51:51] weegey: We already know the classic wow story and we still watch
[2:52:00] fenris_goblin_bath_water: guzu IS the content
[2:52:00] Huertix: main only 63 hours
[2:52:01] MeowgicTheCathering: and you can actually drop difficulty in bg3 if its too hard
[2:52:02] fenris_goblin_bath_water: regardless of game
[2:52:04] cronetym1409: How long until SOD SSF?
[2:52:07] JDEEJORGINHO: @Smooo07 I was very worried about it not being SOLO Self Found, but with the game being centered around group content you don't get to chase anything otherwise - if you wanna run SSF then you're able to avoid any such interactions I suppose (other than being griefed)
[2:52:08] YlaWoW: You have a plugin that makes us able to interact with your choices and vote for the choice when you are not sure if that is something you like
