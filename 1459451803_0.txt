[0:09:27] JustinNotFoundx: please save wow
[0:09:36] JustinNotFoundx: blizzard
[0:09:39] KragnosWoW: 2am @BorlandBTW
[0:09:44] KragnosWoW: HOPIUM
[0:09:51] Zettabyte: lol
[0:09:55] Noshpan: @KragnosWoW I hear ya. I'm still trying to fix my sleep schedule so that I'm not going to bed at 7 am.
[0:09:55] ItsBorland: its 4 here
[0:09:58] Zettabyte: Hopium, makes sense xD
[0:10:00] ItsBorland: One day I wont stay up all night
[0:10:11] CritcobainTV: I'm so close to 3k io on my rogue lol
[0:10:13] ItsBorland: 4 am*
[0:11:46] KragnosWoW: lets hope for more realm-wide/roster-wide systems and an expansion where gear doesnt soft/hard reset every major patch HYPERS
[0:11:52] ItsBorland: What's one thing on everyone wishlist for 10.0? Mine is account wide everything, thats my main wish
[0:12:25] ItsBorland: And please no more leveling KEKW
[0:12:32] Noshpan: Hmmm. Etherials as a playable race, but I don't foresee that ever happening.
[0:13:02] Gingerprimer: Yes plz no more leveling
[0:13:29] CritcobainTV: leveling isn't a bad thing lol
[0:13:46] MrGattz: id be shocked if we dont see account wide rep sooner rather than later
[0:14:11] MrGattz: account wide currency tab would be nice
[0:14:19] Proizo: doubtful ^
[0:14:23] ItsBorland: Lost ark like roster wide systems
[0:14:26] ItsBorland: so nice
[0:14:26] megamanx9999: I really hope so that's what they need to do everything needo everything needs to be account wide
[0:14:44] Proizo: would be nice tho
[0:14:55] KragnosWoW: I dont mind the leveling at the beginning of an expansion but there should be a skip for alts tbh or at the very least double xp for alts going thru the same zones or something
[0:14:55] megamanx9999: And honestly I would say that about the classic versions of wow too
[0:15:09] megamanx9999: Imagine how much better TB C would have felt if reputations were account wide in the same thing with attunements
[0:15:11] Celwind: !wow10
[0:15:12] Moobot: @Celwind World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[0:15:36] megamanx9999: Yeah I agree with that I don't hate leveling I just always see it as something people have to do but the majority of people don't like it is the thing
[0:15:48] megamanx9999: Wait is this a new league
[0:16:05] ItsBorland: @KragnosWoW I agree 100% One character leveling to "cap" is okay but after that its a chore and extremely tedious
[0:16:36] megamanx9999: Right now I know there are people that do like to level but that's very far in view between it doesn't also help that literally you level the same way through every single character
[0:16:56] megamanx9999: Like wouldn't it be cool if there was a system like palace of the dead in World of Warcraft from final fantasy 14
[0:17:01] Noshpan: A boost to XP gain for alts is a nice idea.
[0:17:15] Noshpan: Yeah, they tried that. It was called Torghast.
[0:17:36] mmrghost7: all i care for next exp is that we dont get stat squish again ,
[0:17:43] MrGattz: even account wide gold. all it does is save you a step of having to mail it to yourself. no reason for it to not just be in a general currency tab
[0:18:21] CritcobainTV: @MrGattz stop being logical
[0:18:57] megamanx9999: Yeah that's not a bad idea I mean it worked for Diablo 3
[0:19:00] Celwind: Sad truth is, is that all classes get an stat squish since Blizzard has to "rebalance" the stats. :(
[0:19:18] MrGattz: my bad lol
[0:19:30] megamanx9999: Yeah sadly although if if a big if the leaks are anything to be believed maybe there won't be a level increase in all the zones will just be end game
[0:19:38] CritcobainTV: @MrGattz how ya doin man? haven't talked to ya in a bit
[0:19:39] megamanx9999: Am I the only person that would be really excited about that
[0:19:57] megamanx9999: By the way hello everybody I'm actually new here
[0:19:57] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[0:20:01] Celwind: Plus, Blizzard is known for adding and deleting classes' spells/attacks too
[0:20:25] megamanx9999: Very true if I'm being honest I just kind of hope the next expansion for one sense legion they don't do a borrowed power system
[0:20:37] MrGattz: doing good! getting ready to go to work right now. works taking up all my dang time these days. hbu @Critcobain
[0:20:39] ItsBorland: @megamanx9999 id like that, I  dread leveling. Its my least favorite thing in all MMO's
[0:21:05] CritcobainTV: @MrGattz Not bad man, nervous, i have a raid shadow legends sponsored stream later lol, never done a sponsored anything
[0:21:33] megamanx9999: I think we all can agree on that especially through World of Warcraft and does it even miss the bonus experience boost on BOA gear
[0:21:45] MrGattz: lol that sounds like a good time, good luck! its really no different than a normal stream, dont over think it
[0:22:11] KragnosWoW: @Critcobain is it comission based sponsor or are they paying you to advertise the game? if that makes sense.
[0:22:17] megamanx9999: I don't know I've played final fantasy 14 very little but at all but it's sad when I can play it that little that I did and say there's so much that World of Warcraft could learn
[0:22:40] CritcobainTV: @KragnosWoW paying for downloads basically, every 10 people i get $200 up to 30
[0:22:47] CritcobainTV: so i can make like 600 bucks for a 4 hour stream potentially
[0:22:59] CritcobainTV: just gotta use my link and do the tutorial
[0:23:05] KragnosWoW: nice man
[0:23:15] Celwind: Nice
[0:23:30] CritcobainTV: yeah it's a cool opportunity
[0:23:32] megamanx9999: I'm not actually sure what you're talking about so do you have like an affiliate linger or something for how many people sign up for wow you get paid 10 bucks
[0:23:56] CritcobainTV: it's now WoW @megamanx9999 Just talking about a mobile game lol
[0:23:59] CritcobainTV: not*
[0:24:14] megamanx9999: o I see
[0:24:16] MrGattz: @megamanx9999 yeah i mean just imagine if in wow you only had 1 main character and that char could be every class in the game that you leveled separately. no need for account wide rep, currency, anything. you have 1 main that can do it all. would be great
[0:24:41] Arvidian: that's a good idea @MrGattz
[0:24:44] megamanx9999: I know right won't that be awesome imagine if you could be a light force drain eye and you could just switch to any is switched any class on the fly
[0:25:02] megamanx9999: And if professions were its own progression system scary thoughts I know
[0:25:16] megamanx9999: If I didn't have a Guild I don't think I would have came back to World of Warcraft
[0:25:20] MrGattz: i would say that you should at least be in a main city to switch classes like you need to be with warmode. but yeah.
[0:25:27] megamanx9999: Keep in mind this is me playing TB C not retail
[0:25:49] megamanx9999: I mean to be fair you don't have to be in a main city to switch specks
[0:26:00] KragnosWoW: I also wouldnt mind another attempt at player housing
[0:26:04] megamanx9999: But honestly the only problem I can see what that is the gear
[0:26:32] megamanx9999: Because Final fantasy has its own gear tab for just gear that's separate from your inventory so they would have to implement that I'm not saying it would be impossible but gearing in final fancy and gearing in World of Warcraft are literally 2 different things
[0:27:06] megamanx9999: Same thing here I wouldn't mind seen players Housing I mean it's not my personal thing but that doesn't mean I don't think it wouldn't be cool
[0:28:06] KragnosWoW: mods sent that guy back to the ice age
[0:28:19] CritcobainTV: man went to the shadow realm fast af

[0:29:13] MrGattz: even professions in wow at this point are dated. why do you lose all your progress of previous profs when you switch? why cant we learn them all and just only have 2 active at any given time. why do we have to have bag addons to have a modern inventory screen that doesnt open 5 separate inventory screens. wow has a long ways to go lol.
[0:30:13] KragnosWoW: Too practical for the devs lol

[0:30:30] megamanx9999: Yeah I agree with that at this point I don't see what the reason is why people just can't learn all professions what would be the worst thing that could happen oh no I have to learn all professions

[0:30:40] CritcobainTV: @MrGattz HARD agree
[0:30:54] KragnosWoW: HYPERS quality of life expansion  with a small story to follow
[0:30:55] CritcobainTV: the profession thing is infuriating
[0:31:02] aumixp: Who thinks we will get a new class?
[0:31:03] megamanx9999: I mean realistically I haven't played shadow ends at 10 but from what I've seen it's not hard to level professions I mean hack it would be a benefit you would just go mining and hurrying and then farm stuff so you can level everything else
[0:31:28] megamanx9999: If I'm being honest I hope we don't get a new class I want them to do work on the classes that we have because goodness knows blizzard doesn't know how to balance
[0:32:05] megamanx9999: Terrifying thought remember how balanced things were at the end of wrath  That was really really good balance and we've never gotten that good of balance since then
[0:32:05] KragnosWoW: if everything is OP its balanced Kappa just like mop
[0:32:41] megamanx9999: I don't know I mean Everybody was OP to a degree but warlocks were pretty up there now granted that it's not entirely their fault
[0:32:43] aumixp: Only thing that would exite me is a new class or player housing.. Kinda bored of just new zones, dungeons and raids, etc.. Same old stuff
[0:32:49] DallTV_: haii peeps =)
[0:33:01] Celwind: We will get an new class, they (Blizzard) waited 2(expansions) BoF and Shadow lands to bring an new class, question is, what does Dragon Flight as an whole have an special class or whatever...idk LUL
[0:33:14] megamanx9999: I get what you're saying that's why I think that they need an entire revamp like just take the glasses and smash them with a hammer and revamp everything the thing is will they have time to do it right
[0:33:15] MrGattz: @KragnosWoW *looks over at the dps meter and sees locks doing 2m dps* perfectly balanced the way it should be Kappa
[0:33:32] KragnosWoW: lol
[0:33:39] Celwind: Or, maybe not and maybe the new class is further down the line of more expansions
[0:33:41] megamanx9999: Yeah while everybody else is doing maybe 500 K
[0:34:13] aumixp: !uptime
[0:34:20] megamanx9999: Now again Not entirely Worlock's fault it didn't help that blizzard gave him completely overpowered trinkets Hey guys dot's crib and we get empts whenever we create so let's give them a drink it that increases their cryptians by 100%
[0:34:40] megamanx9999: That's not broken at all
[0:36:43] KragnosWoW: I remember how good it felt in MoP to come across a paladin as a warrior and they would think they were safe with bublle and you would just shattering throw that shit and charge and still die cuz paladins op KEKW
[0:36:58] Celwind: Hearing about an new expansion being announced is both an happy and sad moment. Happy, because it's something to look forward too and new. Sad, because your main class that you play maybe squished to doing less damage overall and/or some of your abilities get deleted and re-placed with something else.
[0:36:58] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[0:37:53] Celwind: ...the angering part, is when Blizzard overhauls your class system and now you have to worry about different things
[0:38:01] megamanx9999: I mean to be fair we don't actually know what they're going to do with classes yeah with classes who knows it's a long shot but maybe just maybe classes won't feel completely horrible at the beginning of the expansion
[0:38:08] KragnosWoW: The sad part is the expansion wont be out for a whole year
[0:38:24] KragnosWoW: so we will be reclearing sepulcher for 8 more months
[0:38:35] Celwind: Yup
[0:38:40] megamanx9999: Yeah I'm still kinda curious what they're gonna do though because supposedly they're going to be announcing something for everything classic wrath and So M as well as the new expansion
[0:39:17] EmperorFredd: Good morning hammper squad towHAMUP hope everyone had a wonderful easter towLove
[0:39:26] megamanx9999: good  1st time here
[0:39:27] KragnosWoW: the what before the storm? Kappa
[0:39:31] douggan01: HeyGuys
[0:39:37] Celwind: 100% they (Blizzard) will also announce wrath serves, since Blizzard is in need of more hype.
[0:39:49] megamanx9999: And actually I want to ask you something because a new classic wrath is coming up I'm not trying to troll or anything but do you think protection paladin and classic wrath will be good in PVP at all

[0:40:14] Celwind: ..on top of the new expansion announcement
[0:40:21] megamanx9999: Because it was something I heard about back in the day but I never got a chance to try it out and I saw some videos and it looks like so much fun
[0:40:44] KragnosWoW: idk i feel like expansion reveal will be enough hype and then wrath announcement in a few months to rebuild the hype would be the play
[0:40:51] SphinxyOCE: HeyGuys
[0:40:54] megamanx9999: Do you think it's viable with the final version of talents or was it just a balancing thing that blizzard fixed
[0:41:19] lirly__: have youseen the 8 leggo exploit stuff on twitter today?
[0:41:24] Celwind: @kragnoswow True, Blizzard may in fact spread the hype for them
[0:41:24] KragnosWoW: holy pal with val'anyr is insane from what ive heard
[0:41:39] megamanx9999: I'm so excited for classic wrath
[0:42:03] mozavich: @KragnosWoW holy paladin in wrath is insane period.
[0:42:42] Artful_Dodger: Huh. I didn't know the Dragon Isles was cut from vanilla WoW early on in development.
[0:42:42] mozavich: beacon of light + glyph of holy light (holy light heals 3 more targets), so essentially, 5 holy lights going off at once.
[0:42:57] Celwind: I get to finally experience what it was like to being an perma heal tree FeelsGoodMan Clap
[0:43:05] EmperorFredd: How is the mic doing today Tow?
[0:43:23] megamanx9999: Yeah I'm aint a palatin back in wrath play if in wrath playing protection in retribution was so fun
[0:43:36] Celwind: Can't wait for Wrath servers to be announced. :D
[0:43:38] megamanx9999: I miss my wrath pally so much
[0:44:05] Nokterian: bless you
[0:44:14] FleuryGG: heard that sneeze with exceptional crispness!
[0:44:15] megamanx9999: Same I'm so excited for it and it looks like it might be soon because I know sunwells on the PTR so I'm willing to bet it's probably going to be released if not this month for sure next month
[0:44:27] Nokterian: crisp sneeze KEKW
[0:44:46] ScurvyHyam: Chromatic?
[0:44:54] akia03: for class guides would wowhead or icy veins be beter?
[0:45:04] PharoGames: blue
[0:45:09] EmperorFredd: Red, green, blue, bronze and black
[0:45:10] MrGattz: at this point both are really well done @akia03
[0:45:12] mozavich: @megamanx9999 instances usually stay on the ptr about a month or so, so i'm exptectiong mid/late may for sunwell and wrath in dec/jan
[0:45:15] Celwind: I joined wow, I think an year in when Wrath was released, I remember that the next expansion was announced when I was still leveling to max at the time LUL
[0:45:25] akia03: @MrGattz k thanks
[0:45:30] MrGattz: wowhead is probly a bit more in depth
[0:45:40] havenbirch: Red Dragons ftw
[0:45:42] megamanx9999: I mean yeah that's true but look how long it felt for BT and hydral it didn't feel like those who were on the PTR for very long before they released
[0:46:03] mozavich: @megamanx9999 they were on ptr for about a month :P
[0:46:20] cosmoflake: damn kyrian owl going at it
[0:46:26] megamanx9999: Really because I remember hearing things like they were on the PTR for a little bit and then they got taken off and then they were here we are it's out so
[0:46:47] mozavich: yeah, servers go up and down. that's the nature of ptr
[0:46:53] megamanx9999: So what worst case scenario not this month but next halfway through
[0:47:06] mozavich: that's what i'm expacting
[0:47:11] megamanx9999: Well know what I mean by that was SSC and TK it felt like were on the peach yar like forever
[0:47:27] megamanx9999: Because what those 2 were on the PR for what it felt like 3 months before they released
[0:47:29] Jay_Vee_NL: music green dragonflight AngelThump

[1:14:12] santamex: yeah Varian was blue warchief then Anduin got it for some reason?, it's supposed to be an elected position not inherited

[1:18:57] megamanx9999: Legion had 4 problems Ralph had I'd say about 2 or 3
[1:19:00] Ortinoth: i still say WOLTK was the best expansion of all time
[1:19:05] cptrogers123: I hope they revamp m+, it really needs it @Towelliee
[1:19:07] megamanx9999: ya
[1:19:13] Piebringer619: woltk was almost perfect
[1:19:23] niko_firehawkings: i enjoyed torgast lmao
[1:19:29] megamanx9999: Like realistically if the TOC raid had only been able to be done once a week per difficulty and you know not 4 I think people wouldn't have hated it so much
[1:19:48] Shrenko: wotlk zones 🤮
[1:19:50] megamanx9999: And at the end of wrath balance overall was the Bes the game ever saw
[1:19:58] Nightshaft25: @niko_firehawkings on you every alt?
[1:20:09] megamanx9999: What I will say is I do agree with that wad had the best leveling experience
[1:20:19] Ortinoth: i am just hoping we don't have another borrowed power mechanic
[1:20:31] Nightshaft25: Mists was best for me
[1:20:32] megamanx9999: Is same I think we're all hoping that
[1:20:36] Ortinoth: its just old
[1:20:37] Piebringer619: aspect power ?
[1:21:26] Piebringer619: i think cata was best for me cause i dint raid in cata only dungeons LUL
[1:21:32] niko_firehawkings: @Nightshaft25  if u focus on a ton of alts.. that sounds like a you problem xD, i use alts only for mount farming and pet farming
[1:22:15] Ortinoth: 2 toons for raiding the all the others for professions / gold farming / mount farming
[1:22:32] Nightshaft25: @niko_firehawkings so we agree to disagree mate  GOOD TALK XD
[1:22:33] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[1:22:39] Ortinoth: i don't have time to raid anymore - kinda miss it
[1:22:47] aumixp: God what i miss chris metzens announcements of xpac
[1:22:50] megamanx9999: Well I mean it kind of depends doesn't it because if you want to do well in the game if this class is broken to the point where it can't can't pump good numbers and you can't get into  Anything that seems like a problem with the game not you
[1:22:51] Nougat_V: is that official with that announcement?
[1:22:55] Ortinoth: i get like 10 hours a week to play
[1:23:04] niko_firehawkings: @Nightshaft25  our play styles are completely diferent yet, i focus on a single char mainly ^^cause im happy with my class + im not a pvper
[1:23:13] niko_firehawkings: so for me to switch classes is pointless
[1:23:15] captainbaldspot: Does he play Lost Ark anymore?
[1:23:17] Ortinoth: @Nougat_V not till tuesday for the full announcement - anything discussed today is speculation
[1:23:28] Piebringer619: i love that dungeons gets more intresting each expansion
[1:23:31] megamanx9999: I play it off and on
[1:23:37] Nightshaft25: this music
[1:23:40] megamanx9999: It's a really fun game
[1:23:50] EmpathyLiveChat: @megamanx9999 does it?
[1:23:54] megamanx9999: The dungeons are amazing
[1:24:07] KaisenSiru: PotFriend
[1:24:11] Nightshaft25: WHAT YOUR FIGHTING FOR?
[1:24:25] NewWorldReign: didnt FFO just have a new expansion?
[1:24:29] megamanx9999: Well I guess what I mean is if you wanna do any type of rate progression and you're in any type of rating Guild you're indirectly required to have multiple ults at this point
[1:24:32] Piebringer619: i dont raid so i am good with good dungeons
[1:24:36] doomester: @Towelliee is it cold, thats why the sweater?
[1:24:38] megamanx9999: At least that's the way it feels and looks
[1:24:42] Nougat_V: @Ortinoth oh ok, thx
[1:24:57] haaukan: @Towelliee can u send your elvui profil? =)
[1:25:06] EmpathyLiveChat: @megamanx9999 makes sense
[1:25:07] Nightshaft25: i make a MoP trailer reference bro KEKW
[1:25:48] megamanx9999: And I kind of get what you're saying I mean if you just want to do mythic plus yeah you can just have one character but I think it also kind of robs you I mean if I want to try out a different character I think I should be able to do that without having to grind 80 hours worth of whatever power system
[1:25:58] Piebringer619: no cgi WutFace
[1:26:01] laurent94: so whats the new expansion about ? any leaks ?
[1:26:03] Nokterian: i hope a cinematic

[1:26:38] megamanx9999: Again does anyone else think that that name just sounds so plain for an expan
[1:26:40] lithium364: live action with Ion sylvanas
[1:26:41] pink_ninja_turtle: WOTLK at Christmas.. mabye 🤷🏻 lets goooo
[1:26:48] garkhyt: Expansion with no CGI is kinda pepega
[1:26:49] laurent94: ah damn.. how do you go from beyond death lands and celestials, back to azeroth dragons stuff
[1:27:00] megamanx9999: See I think Ralph is going to be in October early November
[1:27:02] Gars2: @Towelliee Have any expansion name leaks been true before? That would be interesting to see
[1:27:12] szble: sounds fine
[1:27:18] megamanx9999: Fair point
[1:27:18] VassilisKappa: My top3 wishlist. -1.Account wide everything, except gear. -2.Flying with some grinding on 10.0 -3. Some classes get 4rth spec, like shaman tanking, mage chrono heal etc.

[1:36:18] Nightshaft25: @wolvepg yeah have some good parts
[1:36:19] Anneris1: I hate that removed rep from dailys, now its harder to hit paragon chests for rewards
[1:36:28] RealMelorandor: If they make a new Torghast like the Tower of the Aspects, I hope its more of a boss rush like the Jailer's Gauntlet than what we got with Torghast in the beginning
[1:36:31] KaisenSiru: Every expansion had "time gating" People like to ignore that fact LUL
[1:36:33] lithium364: time to brign Honing into wow PogChamp YouWHY

[1:38:37] Yagr6: make the bank like a stash tab from diablo across characters? @Towelliee
[1:38:39] Armdel: if you do that though people are gonna start feeling forced to play alts instead, atleast the min maxers
[1:38:39] pink_ninja_turtle: make Ogre race take up 2 raid slots as a racial trait 😁
[1:38:44] EmpathyLiveChat: I actually quite like keeping gold and auctions on different alts
[1:38:46] wolvepg: and not do the story 7 times would be nice
[1:38:47] RealMelorandor: Lol how likely do you think they are going to do Shadowlands Covenant Allied Races lol?
[1:38:54] megamanx9999: yep
[1:38:55] Typh166: That would be awesome.  Yeah bluesmaan I always wished wow had account wide features like GW2.

[1:39:18] king_julian_96: It’s not needed
[1:39:24] amricatt: That would be wonderful.
[1:39:26] mavericks312: @king_julian_96 just make LFR normal mode
[1:39:31] megamanx9999: I say remove LFR but also remove the gear from mythic rating so it's not encouraged by denon hardcore player base
[1:39:34] Frank4LuLz: IS IT JUST OLD WOW DEVS, OR THE NEW ONES THAT DONT GET IT @Towelliee
[1:39:57] Nightshaft25: @mavericks312 this
[1:40:11] megamanx9999: If I'm being honest I have a different theory I think that management is telling them that they have to do the stuff to try and make more money and they only care about the short term profits
[1:40:12] mozavich: @king_julian_96 yea not gonna happen

[1:41:15] Artful_Dodger: Drop the meaningful choices crap
[1:41:16] Nightshaft25: no job system will suck now
[1:41:22] megamanx9999: Well I would make an argument one of the bigger problems actually is add on as well I think if developers didn't have to do an arms race with combat ad on it's an actually tuned the bosses where they were doable by a normal person without assistance by add on the difficulty curve would be a little bit more normalized
[1:41:26] wrestlol: wotlk+ reveal tomorrow?
[1:41:32] Armdel: they seem to have been stuck in the mindset that having to do stuff again on alts is a "good" way to increase playtime
[1:41:35] MarquisLek: as long as they make the new borrowed power unlockable from the start like artifact
[1:41:48] EmpathyLiveChat: @WrestDota nah, they want everyone focussed on Dragonflight
[1:41:54] megamanx9999: I agree with that and I'll outright say it I want the job system and wow
[1:41:56] mavericks312: add-ons aren't going anywhere stop it
[1:42:09] king_julian_96: Why not lfr is meanless it’s for casuals who can’t play much andgives bad gear no need for LFR just remove it and be done with it
[1:42:09] EmpathyLiveChat: Same. I didn't have alts until BFA in fact
[1:42:12] Jokervenom1978: I only had 2 toons in Wrath.
[1:42:12] mavericks312: job system doesn't work for wow
[1:42:13] RealMelorandor: Cheer300 The more alt friendly WoW is the better the game is
[1:42:14] PrimalRain: yeah vanilla took so much time people didn't have alts really
[1:42:20] Nebulizer87: I played every healer in wrath
[1:42:26] ArcaneSyntax: alts didn't really become a thing until wrath and even then it was rare. WoD was the alt expansion.
[1:42:31] mozavich: @WrestDota it's a retail reveal. we already know they're releasing wotlk classic from the survey they sent out
[1:42:31] Nebulizer87: Can’t do that the last few expansions
[1:42:33] Scoodles91: making an alt was a 1 month thing, not 10h
[1:42:36] Nokterian: I'm playing all healers
[1:42:37] WayneG947: i always ran one of each class, not because i love alts, but because i love variety. Like in FF14 atm i am leveling all my jobs to 60
[1:42:39] megamanx9999: Right well even me I wasn't really an ultimate person per se but in wrath of the ledge king was the 1st time I had 3 characters to Max
[1:42:42] amricatt: I've had tons of alts since Vanilla.  I like a lot of variety.
[1:42:51] Melonbrew: I did the ZM Cyphers on two characters. I can't do it anymore
[1:42:53] KaisenSiru: Every race for all classe for both factions, both genders
[1:42:54] KragnosWoW: but how would blizzard differntiate an alt between a main>
[1:42:56] Jokervenom1978: PREACH Towelliee!
[1:43:04] Armdel: think i played the most alts in legion actually
[1:43:05] stratiss: true my man
[1:43:11] megamanx9999: Right and then you have to do a 100 more for every single alt
[1:43:23] EmpathyLiveChat: My first alts were the free character boosts that came with Heroic versions of the g
[1:43:27] Nightshaft25: I love variety also
[1:43:32] MaverickUK2K: !wow10
[1:43:33] Moobot: @MaverickUK2K World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[1:43:37] jerseyfive: if you have no content tahts the only way to keep people playing...
[1:43:38] Honeycrispie: wotlk date announced tues wouldn't surprise me, but I think they'll seperate the two.
[1:43:42] megamanx9999: And this is why I didn't play shadow shadow Anne's I just now got my 1st character 60 and only because it's at the end so I figured all the stuff would be fixed by now
[1:43:48] mavericks312: I think more stuff will be account wide for sure but I highly doubt everything is account wide at launch atleast
[1:43:50] MissyKib: Im starting to wonder if this will be the first Xpac i have not played at release time for a few days straight
[1:44:03] ayopoppy_: played a lot this exp, but then tooka long break cause it got boring to me. Looking forward to new expan, probably will comeback for the new content!
[1:44:04] Nightshaft25: Legion was good alting expansion
[1:44:06] megamanx9999: See I very convinced that they're going to announce classic wrath on Tuesday on Tuesday and supposedly they're going to be talking about So M as well which I'm actually kind of more curious about
[1:44:18] megamanx9999: it was
[1:44:29] Praetour: Would make mythic invitational more interesting too since people can test out more class combos
[1:44:30] RealMelorandor: Instead of player housing, we get player taverns and when we are not on our mains, we can see our main character and alts chilling out with each other in the player tavern playing hearthstone and drinking mead
[1:44:32] Kisswani: Hi chat , Hey Towel towHAMUP
[1:44:34] Nightshaft25: PREACH
[1:44:38] Hakurumon: 100% this tbh
[1:44:43] megamanx9999: You're talking madness sir that's assuming they actually have common sense and that's a super power now
[1:44:43] Armdel: its the standard in like every mmo but wow nowadays ye
[1:44:46] Sandisy: oh they know but for whatever reason they try to milk hours played from a subscription game
[1:44:50] ILikeKillTheZombies: i hate having to do the same campaign when i joined the same covenant as my main for example
[1:44:54] Kisswani: @realMelorandor yoooooo that's one hell of an idea
[1:44:59] megamanx9999: Now granted I'm not disagreeing with you and your 100% right
[1:45:13] Frank4LuLz: wow doesnt love us,  or really cares about us anymore, since WOD
[1:45:18] wolvepg: If they want meaningfull and they do that, then your main will feel meaning full "the strong guy"
[1:45:20] chukudu: !armory
[1:45:20] Moobot: @chukudu Towelliee's Paladin | worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/illidan/towelliee | Monk | https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/illidan/towellieesan
[1:45:24] Jokervenom1978: If they go balls-deep with account wide I will be a very happy man.
[1:45:30] xiStayRagingx: they want you to play alts and struggle to gear to make you wanna play more like you would ur main. blizzards logic.
[1:45:39] megamanx9999: I mean again to be fair I think outside of 3 problems legion was perfecthis egion was perfect overall
[1:45:42] Nightshaft25: @realmelorandor real good shit
[1:45:46] amricatt: It's time to do account wide.  The game is 18+ years old at this time.
[1:45:46] Mike__Ro: yeah that roster system of lost ark makes me feel that all of my characters can become mains in a split second
[1:45:47] Tompsn_: There really is no reason not to have account wide reps
[1:46:05] megamanx9999: Yeah I 100% guarantee that too is anyone else kind of looking at ashes of creation at all
[1:46:09] Praetour: They're looking at that and going "Microtransactions for cosmetics" Kappa
[1:46:22] mozavich: lots of bots inflating those numbers on lost ark though
[1:46:25] ILikeKillTheZombies: they need to start banning more bots in lost ark
[1:46:26] dmarinn: ashes KEKW
[1:46:27] megamanx9999: I just say have account white everything just account white everything just throw it all in the makes everything account wide everything
[1:46:29] reggiepowa: lost ark is f2p
[1:46:31] mavericks312: ashes won't be out till 2085
[1:46:34] ILikeKillTheZombies: in beginning zones you only see bots
[1:46:35] stratiss: yeah man completely agree i just want to play the game, and when you limit my ability to do that on alts i just play something else
[1:46:37] Smihaa: yea alot of bots tbh
[1:46:44] RealMelorandor: Asses of Creation
[1:46:57] Frank4LuLz: ashes is llike 2027???
[1:46:58] mavericks312: ashes may have a beta by 2040
[1:46:59] Nightshaft25: is like BOT ARK KEKW
[1:47:00] DallTV_: ashes of never comes out : P
[1:47:08] RealMelorandor: Ashes of Scamnation
[1:47:08] FranciscoTheMage: stars of creations ashes
[1:47:09] megamanx9999: I watched that video though just crazy an hour unjust character customization nuts
[1:47:13] WayneG947: Ashes blew their load too early, now they are fast becoming a meme
[1:47:18] Cafe0le: make a mage tower 2.0 and easy to catch up alts to complete it
[1:47:28] mozavich: @ILikeKillTheZombies not even beginning zones, go to any major city like north vern and watch them teleport around every where
[1:47:33] megamanx9999: I mean I look at their site there's not much data on gameplay or anything like that it looks like it could be good though
[1:47:53] RealMelorandor: Ashes of Creation seems like a scam
[1:47:55] Stabberello: Ugh Storming in those small spaces
[1:48:03] mavericks312: at this point ashes will have no hype come release
[1:48:15] mozavich: as for ashes of creation, i can't speak for the mmo, but unreal engine 5 looks sick.
[1:48:20] Mike__Ro: @realMelorandor so true
[1:48:26] Cryttan: @realMelorandor  How is it a scam? LUL
[1:48:30] RealMelorandor: Ashes of Creation will crash and burn so fast it will just be called Ashes.
[1:48:41] ILikeKillTheZombies: class needs to be for more races than only 2
[1:48:42] Mike__Ro: @realMelorandor like a ''hype scamm''
[1:48:48] mozavich: @Cryttan look up "the 8 million dollar game that never got made"
[1:48:58] megamanx9999: When I say a world revamp I don't think like cataclysm revamp I think like a realm reborn style of revamp
[1:49:14] ILikeKillTheZombies: if we get tinkers and it will be only gnomes and goblins... oh lord
[1:49:16] mavericks312: @realmelorandor ashes of hopes and dreams lol
[1:49:17] ILikeKillTheZombies: :D
[1:49:24] Spathotan: Even if it is a scam itll be around for a long time and make a lot of money. Look at Star Citizen
[1:49:25] Cafe0le: world revamp is what will bring a ton of players, alt friendly systems will retain them
[1:49:25] Frank4LuLz: wow casino
[1:49:28] megamanx9999: Amen brother Amen
[1:49:30] malddktank: max lvl, unlock flying again, grind the same dungeons every week
[1:49:32] mavericks312: but towelliee WQ's 3.0 will be different
[1:49:37] KragnosWoW: yall askin too much, this is going to be a transition to microsoft expansion where blizzard will give us something to distract us while they transition under microsoft
[1:49:39] ashwing_: world quests 2.0 where they never happened LUL
[1:49:42] megamanx9999: I think that would be cool like the fate system in final fantasy 14 was really fun same thing with palace of the dead
[1:49:43] RealMelorandor: FATEs and GW2 - PLZ TO GOD NOT LOOK AT ESO
[1:49:46] Nightshaft25: @megamanx9999 that would be WoW 2
[1:49:56] megamanx9999: ya
[1:49:57] Shrenko: my man said pvp 😂 👌
[1:50:06] RealMelorandor: Maybe Public Dungeons and collectibles
[1:50:15] jerseyfive: people are expecting way too much from 10.0, they want a brand new wow and no way can blizzard make that in only 1 year
[1:50:19] megamanx9999: Right don't get me wrong I'm not saying that World of Warcraft should be final fantasy 14 but they could look at final fancy 14 and take inspiration
[1:50:31] MasterNeff: The second they announce account wide things ill nut
[1:50:35] mozavich: @Shrenko he's probably referring to the arena championships, which are successful
[1:50:40] Cryttan: @mozavich Yeah but the lead dev is funding the development himself so it's not a scam even if it fails or never gets made.
[1:50:41] Praetour: More than 3 raids would be nice
[1:50:46] megamanx9999: I think it would be really cool if they started adding some of the older dungeons to the mythic plus rotation like am I the only one that thinks ABRD mythic plus would be really cool
[1:50:56] Honeycrispie: @jerseyfive they've been working on it a lot longer than 1yr lol. 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀

[1:51:00] megamanx9999: I know it would be really long but part of me thinks that would be really cool though I'd be interested to see what they would do with
[1:51:01] Stonefather: Which is depressing.
[1:51:05] mavericks312: shadowlands pvp is actually in a good place
[1:51:06] krankyoldlady: I dont like the; your io  rating is not up to pasrr...kick goodbye thing
[1:51:25] RealMelorandor: Re-release Strand of the Ancients
[1:51:31] Jacorvin: i think player housing alone would sell it for a ton of folks
[1:51:32] PrimalRain: more new dungeons throughout the exp would be nice too
[1:51:32] Nightshaft25: Wait is not storytelling one of WoW success points Kappa
[1:51:33] Cryttan: @Towelliee Do you have a list of things you want to see for 10.0? Maybe you already made one but could be an interesting video.
[1:51:37] mavericks312: @krankyoldlady that's not on WoW though that's the community
[1:51:43] Darthyrevan: pvp still exists? LUL
[1:51:48] ILikeKillTheZombies: queue for rated pvp, like the brawl
[1:51:59] ILikeKillTheZombies: we have now
[1:51:59] mozavich: @Cryttan yeah, i'm not saying ashes of creation is a scam, that was someone else but i wanted to draw attention to the fact that promises are just that until the game is created.
[1:52:01] Stonefather: WoW storytelling was pretty good a decade ago Keepo
[1:52:08] Honeycrispie: without rating the game is beyond frustrating to play. people wanna play with players that are as experienced as they are, that's not going away.
[1:52:09] cptrogers123: When is the best time to buy a wow token? @Towelliee
[1:52:22] Jacorvin: the  dev diary straight up said story was not a focus as players wont really care.
[1:52:22] megamanx9999: The story was good probably I would say until mop
[1:52:23] mozavich: @Stonefather i lol'd.
[1:52:24] RealMelorandor: I think a lot more people kind of do care about the story than you think
[1:52:27] krankyoldlady: @mavericks312 true but your general casual is still confronted with it, unliike in lets say ff14
[1:52:28] ILikeKillTheZombies: If i don't enjoy the story of zones or overall, i feel less excited doing content in that expansion
[1:52:32] Nightshaft25: @stonefather true my dude Kappa
[1:52:37] dmarinn: @Fille1809 hype time, patchs, exp announces
[1:52:38] Cafe0le: i wouldnt play wow and neither any on my battlenet firends wihout pvp arena
[1:52:39] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[1:52:40] megamanx9999: And it did pick up in legion it's just now there's they don't actually tell a story is the problem
[1:52:43] amricatt: I like the story aspect.  I do wish it would go back to more local stories instead of all the cosmic stuff.
[1:52:44] Sniper_Penguin: 2k LUL
[1:52:53] megamanx9999: They're trying to make roll the warcraft into Game of Thrones before they even have the 1st page written
[1:52:57] KragnosWoW: welp that was a lame cinematic... anyway back to sha to try and get the mount KEKW
[1:52:59] mavericks312: @fille1809 the best time would have been over the weekend it's gonna go up today and tomorrow due to the xpac announcement
[1:53:18] king_julian_96: simpel if you liek good stories and story based games go play ffxiv problem solved
[1:53:20] Stonefather: I'll be honest, I was looking forward to the cosmic stuff until that one robot got shutdown at the end of the new raid.
[1:53:56] SicDogg: i dont follow the lore
[1:53:56] Shrenko: Nobbel BibleThump
[1:54:00] Barticletv: @king_julian_96 nah, cause ff gameplay ain’t for me.
[1:54:01] Nightshaft25: @stonefather  what a shitshow
[1:54:14] CritcobainTV: Yeah i don't pay attention to story. I just like to kill shit bro
[1:54:15] Cryttan: All I need to keep playing is rated solo Q. There is zero motivation to do all the chores and grinds just to sit in group finder. Majority of players are boosted and leave after 1 loss aswell. PvP scene is a complete mess.
[1:54:26] Nokterian: LUL
[1:54:36] megamanx9999: I just don't think the story has an actual direction and they want it to be bigger than it actually is but then again if the rumors are anything to be believed I could it could very much make sense
[1:54:37] Nokterian: Cartman Towelliee
[1:54:39] Shrenko: predictable 🤓 ☝️
[1:54:40] RealMelorandor: I remember a few weeks ago people were wishing/lobbing death threats at Steve Danuser lol
[1:54:40] ZangetsuVMG: Nice colon imersonation KEKW
[1:54:49] Squidnapped: Oh the inhaler shot. Nailed the imagery LUL
[1:54:49] ILikeKillTheZombies: I think its good that people that are into a story also have heated discussions about it and not simply taking everything as it is.
[1:54:52] Cryttan: @mozavich  Yeah I was hyped for the game like 3-4 years ago now i'm not even looking at it untill it comes out.
[1:54:52] megamanx9999: Because supposedly all of shadowands was apparently re written in 6 months before the expansion launched
[1:54:53] mozavich: @Stonefather a decade ago was the between cataclysm and pandaria. are you sure the storytelling was good a decade ago? :P
[1:55:07] Barticletv: Yeah but why was he a big bad guy? We never really have been givin a reason in-game right?
[1:55:11] darssia_: it's just weird blizz doesn't even know their own lore
[1:55:16] megamanx9999: Yeah exactly and I get you and there is a huge part of people that don't care about the story
[1:55:18] Stonefather: I mean cataclysm wasn't terrible and Pandaria was okayish the first time it was told.
[1:55:24] Jacorvin: All the story  I need is "The princess is in another castle."
[1:55:28] ti92ma: Enjoying the world "of warcraft"
[1:55:29] Xsilentghost: Do you think its too much to ask for 10 dungeons on launch
[1:55:41] reggiepowa: dk mced a mob
[1:55:50] mozavich: @Stonefather cataclysm story was abysmal
[1:55:56] Honeycrispie: legion FeelsStrongMan  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[1:55:56] megamanx9999: I mean to be fair that's kind of what they keep doing I mean at this very point does anyone actually know what happened to the jailer and why he turned into essentially a robot
[1:56:04] Nightshaft25: Pandaria has the best STORYTELLING enough said
[1:56:04] king_julian_96: i agree
[1:56:07] flebbooo: YEP agreed
[1:56:10] Spathotan: Agree
[1:56:17] themadbunny275: if ffxiv can do it wow can too
[1:56:19] king_julian_96: like it was stupid that we did'nt get a new dungeon in 9.2
[1:56:25] king_julian_96: i was expecting one
[1:56:30] flebbooo: Felt real nice in legion having a new dungeon every patch
[1:56:33] Nightshaft25: true
[1:56:33] megamanx9999: No I see I would say legion had the best story telling now were there holes in the story will yeah but there is holes in mop 2 but at least legion had a beginning a middle and an end
[1:56:33] Spathotan: Spathotan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! 
[1:56:34] Stonefather: @mozavich I mean the ending literally made no sense but at least it wasn't the complete shitshow BFA and Shadowlands was.
[1:56:40] reggiepowa: considering they reuse a lot of assets for dungeons anyway I dont see why that would be hard
[1:56:41] tubbipack: do you think account wide rep is a possibility?
[1:56:58] Jacorvin: @Towelliee would that still include a mega dungeon per expac?
[1:57:08] megamanx9999: If they do account wide I hope it's everything because I think if they were to say account wide wraps the 1st question would happen why not give us everything not just reputations
[1:57:13] king_julian_96: liek don't get me wrong it's great that we got a new raid in 9.2 but i think we should of gotten a new dungeon aswell
[1:57:14] Shrenko: @tubbipack yes they even said a long time ago that is something they want
[1:57:29] ijuki: My friends said this: "3 new dungeons, 2 raids, class fixes, 2 new zones" with each patch. I was like "you mad bruh?"
[1:57:31] mozavich: @Stonefather just because one or two expansion's storytelling was even worse doesn't make another good. lol.
[1:57:35] XarkoLP: Just 10.1 mega dung,  10.2 mega dung get m+ and a new mega dung. 10.3 new normal dungs and last mega dung gets m+. tihis would be a nice shedule
[1:57:41] megamanx9999: Yeah I agree now what I will say what they're doing now with the whole new season is good but if it's I think what we need to is more communication
[1:57:47] XarkoLP: Dragon on your screen. Is this a leak? Kappa
[1:57:58] KaisenSiru: Prepare for more dragons on the screen LUL
[1:58:05] Nightshaft25: WoD Raid Finale was pretty good better from BoA tho
[1:58:26] Stonefather: @mozavich No, but it's how you compare something. Cataclysm's story was no way great but in comparison to BFA and Shadowlands it wasn't the worst thing.
[1:58:42] MetalJoshP: The hype of a new expansion brings me back as a kid to the excitement of tbc the first reveal of that level of new content was a great feeling can’t wait for tomorrow
[1:59:02] mozavich: @Stonefather comparing shit to shit doesn't make the first shit stink less. that's asinine lol.
[1:59:14] amricatt: I hope that the announcement has some features, not just a general theme.
[1:59:16] FashionBeforeDPS: WoW + Vape = :)
[1:59:16] Xsilentghost: Mega dungeons need to start with mythic +
[1:59:25] flebbooo: 7.2 pretty sure
[1:59:30] king_julian_96: i agree a new dungeon should be add every patch which is why iwas confused when we did'nt get oen this patch
[1:59:43] CritcobainTV: legion was so fuckin good
[1:59:48] falldrgn: make mythic 0 its own match making difficulty
[1:59:51] matamune07: mega dungeon like blackrock depths?? :D
[1:59:54] Stonefather: @mozavich I'm comparing an expansion's story to another expansion of the same game, not quite sure how that's asinine but sure my bad "Catacylsm bad" danDerp
[2:00:05] Darthyrevan: Yeah but Pandemic
[2:00:05] flebbooo: I always feel like i took Legion for granted FeelsBadMan
[2:00:09] Nightshaft25: @stonefather was another times bro..until WoD Cataclysm was the worst expansion
[2:00:11] KragnosWoW: i remember so many people complaining at the beginning of legion
[2:00:12] Jacorvin: legion got me to level a priest, which I refused to do since vanilla.
[2:00:20] Frank4LuLz: which team was in charge of Legion, get that guy to run shit @Towelliee
[2:00:21] nephttv_: Legion was goated
[2:00:21] megamanx9999: I still stand by the opinion if they got rid of Titan 14 war 14 and if we had the legendary vendor at launch legion would have been perfect
[2:00:27] Honeycrispie: people 100% took legion for granted.  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[2:00:59] king_julian_96: like why have a new dungeon every patch except this one  personally i think 9.2 should of atleast added a new dungeon along eeith the raid
[2:01:01] Nightshaft25: Legion was 100% Chef kiss
[2:01:02] CritcobainTV: my io is like 2916. I need to knock out ToP before tomorrows reset, then i hit 3k next week

[2:01:05] Nebulizer87: Trial of Valor was…tuff
[2:01:10] megamanx9999: Now maybe artifact knowledge could have scaled a little bit faster but overall you know I would say outside of those technically 4
[2:01:15] ijuki: They changed holy priest mastery in legion... haven't played it much since legion PepeHands

[2:01:25] byrdeen45: i would love wow to put in something like chaos dungeon from lost arch
[2:01:32] ti92ma: Where are your feelings at for the reveal? Like excited as fuck or it is what it is?
[2:01:35] Docta_G: I want a mega dungeon like blackrock depths, not one made for m+
[2:01:45] Syborc: Got a question, the boss designer for halondrus was the same as for Painsmith right?
[2:01:58] Nokterian: towStop towIt
[2:01:59] KaisenSiru: Trial of valor was good. Wish they removed The Chosen when the next raid released so it couldnt be chased at the end of the expansion. As someone who got Chosen for all armor types
[2:02:00] ijuki: BRD m+ monkaS
[2:02:04] Docta_G: haha
[2:02:07] battle_soap: nobody wants BRD!
[2:02:09] KragnosWoW: 40 man mythic raids Kappa
[2:02:11] Nightshaft25: GET OUT
[2:02:12] matamune07: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:02:17] Spathotan: Imagine running dire maul in 2022
[2:02:20] FleuryGG: turn blackwing decent into a megadungeon  tbh
[2:02:26] Honeycrispie: BRD is amazing as it was, don't touch it. it's fine in classic
[2:02:29] akia03: dire maul would be nice a revamp of tht
[2:02:30] MoonwalkingAngel79: 1 hour dungeons
[2:02:35] Nokterian: Dire Maul NotLikeThis
[2:02:38] megamanx9999: way no m+brd?
[2:02:41] Docta_G: i meant more in terms of lots of paths, exploration etc
[2:02:43] cptrogers123: you ever thought about pushing +20 keys?
[2:02:50] megamanx9999: why not ?
[2:03:07] megamanx9999: thek it wid be cool
[2:03:10] KragnosWoW: we want chadbomb we want chadbomb towRee towRee
[2:03:18] Nightshaft25: That why Classic exists
[2:03:23] akia03: how is that legion trinket working for you?
[2:03:29] SuperLost89: i've always wished for an expansion like wotlk. it was pretty basic in regards to systems, but i found it more enjoyable compared to all these new systems that are in shadowlands. maybe im wrong idk lol
[2:03:44] Spathotan: The flow of alot of those older dungeons is just bad compared to today. Long walks, big gaps between mobs making the dungeon unnecessarily longer, yadda yadda
[2:03:50] king_julian_96: what we get higher ilvl conduits anyway in season 4
[2:03:51] megamanx9999: I mean a mythic plus version of BRD isn't the same version in classic
[2:03:59] Thoreya: all i want is more 8 dungeons at launch
[2:04:02] Thoreya: 8 dungeons felt really bnad
[2:04:02] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:04:03] KragnosWoW: youre telling me a trinket from legion is bis right now? isnt that like 50 ilvl?
[2:04:06] Thoreya: bad*
[2:04:09] megamanx9999: I mean granted that would have to be a really long Keystone but still I think it would be really cool to see
[2:04:11] akia03: that ring any good for tanks?
[2:04:13] doomester: @akia03 which legion trinket?
[2:04:17] CritcobainTV: been like that. lol
[2:04:26] KragnosWoW: jeez
[2:04:34] megamanx9999: ah I see wow
[2:04:41] KragnosWoW: i dont m+ so never knew KEKW
[2:05:14] akia03: @doomester faulty countermeasure
[2:05:15] Sniper_Penguin: the conduit booster to 278 conduits at 3k isnt account wide either
[2:05:17] Nightshaft25: I wait for Warth Classic for the experience and Ulduar..i
[2:05:22] megamanx9999: I'm playing shadowlands very little so I'm actually not sure what you're talking about
[2:05:30] king_julian_96: cause most people problem don't care to do anything higher then a 15 or 16 for there vault
[2:05:47] megamanx9999: m+ Portals ?
[2:05:57] Klax99: hope they remove the valor cap next reset, still rocking some 262s
[2:05:58] Nightshaft25: @megamanx9999 good for you
[2:06:09] megamanx9999: I think we all are looking forward to classic wrath
[2:06:12] akia03: hope 9.2.5 gives condiuts for flux or something
[2:06:17] Stonefather: Because that would be fun and Blizzard is anti-fun, you know this Towelliee.
[2:06:19] cptrogers123: can u recommend any netflix series or movies. Im running dry LUL
[2:06:19] Syborc: But thats the problem, Blizzard forgotten that a Video game should be fun and not be like work
[2:06:30] Lonedh: This guy… this guy gets it!
[2:06:31] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee ally or horde for wrath?
[2:06:32] Honeycrispie: all the changes  󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[2:06:33] megamanx9999: Yeah wrath was my favorite expansion bro
[2:06:37] Honeycrispie: throw us alll the changes pls
[2:06:41] blazenalot: bring back twilight devastion
[2:06:44] doomester: is Faulty countmeasure good as a paladin also?
[2:06:47] megamanx9999: Hot take I still don't like holy power even now

[2:06:54] Dogewiz: @Towelliee how alt friendly would you say classic wrath is cuz I want to play my war and pally at the same time?
[2:06:59] megamanx9999: I think it was good for holy paladins and nothing else
[2:07:02] Stonefather: God I miss TD a lot. Say what you want about corruptions but TD procs were a lot of fun.
[2:07:05] KragnosWoW: can dwarves be paladins in wrath>?
[2:07:05] ijuki: @Honeycrispie Wait 1 day and 5 hours Kappa
[2:07:08] Shrenko: the classic stuff is dead to me because everyone just buys gold via websites and Blizzard doesnt do anything about it. ruins the whole fun of it IMO
[2:07:13] DingDongDean: @Towelliee Will you tell us more about your wotlk insider knoweledge tomorrow when they announce information ?
[2:07:15] Syborc: @megamanx9999 not really a hot take, most ppl hate the rogue combo point system
[2:07:17] ArcaneSyntax: I really hope classic wrath launches with the dungeon finder
[2:07:19] king_julian_96: i will tell you why there no accountwide is cause most peopel don't care to do keys higher then 15 or 16 they just want to do there 15s every week to get highest ilvl llot that's all
[2:07:19] nephttv_: towelliee is pug smart
[2:07:20] Nightshaft25: Classic Warth Hype

[2:07:44] megamanx9999: Really so I'm not the only retribution pallon that hated holy power
[2:07:53] KaisenSiru: @megamanx9999 Nope. As someone with Realm First Heroic LK 25 achievement, Wrath Classic does nothing for me. It'll be a side thing with friends, but not focus like current WoW always will be.
[2:07:53] Dogewiz: lol
[2:08:00] akia03: blood dk as dps was fun
[2:08:06] Armdel: @KragnosWoW aren't they one of the OG paladin races?
[2:08:10] Honeycrispie: big mistake if they leave wotlk how it was. praying for changes. TBC is so incredibly boring rn. 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[2:08:10] FranciscoTheMage: i would love to play wrath classic. they need to give people who six month sub a 60 boost for Wrath Classic or if you 1 year sub @Towelliee im not levelling a char to get to classic wrath
[2:08:12] megamanx9999: From what I was told it was a pretty niche complaint everyone and oz said that I was stupid for that because their words not mine and made the class feel more cough cough interactive
[2:08:19] Shrenko: @KragnosWoW I have no idea which sites they are using I havent looked into it. I stopped playing a while ago when I found out people just buys tons of gold and doing GDKP runs
[2:08:37] 3663Sharad: kill the relic, but you have to wait with the Wo Add kill
[2:08:37] CritcobainTV: g2g.com bis Kappa
[2:08:40] KragnosWoW: @Armdel idk i thought only humans could be paladins
[2:08:54] megamanx9999: I don't know when cataclysm came and the changes came changes came I absolutely hated what they did to retribution like if I want to play a rogue I'd play a rogue not a paladin

[2:13:43] reggiepowa: they are super annoying
[2:13:45] Honeycrispie: The guardians are such a massive time waste 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[2:13:50] Sniper_Penguin: Yea but theres a different feeling killing trash after the bosses
[2:14:02] 3663Sharad: @mrrazputin Skip to boss, lust, clear trash, have lust for second boss
[2:14:03] KragnosWoW: @critcobain 70k EZ Clap on mankrik KEKW

[2:15:07] CritcobainTV: if i make $600 from this RSL stream, I'm just buying a new CPU and a webcam
[2:15:20] 3663Sharad: @mrrazputin 3rd is easier imo. but you could save for 3rd yeah
[2:15:20] KragnosWoW: @Critcobain oh thought glaives were op for a while thats big sadge
[2:15:37] Scraggersmeh: @KragnosWoW Nope. Glaives are garbo in wotlk due to the lack of demons.
[2:16:38] KragnosWoW: what about thunderfury?
[2:16:41] CritcobainTV: yeah they didn't. les dps than blues from questing in wrath

[2:55:30] CrusaderNero: cant wait for 10.0 in april 2023
[2:55:38] SeckSymbols: I would be fine with a shortened season 3 to get into season 4 quicker
[2:55:41] bob_the_demon: No chance of 9.2.5 date tomorrow
[2:55:43] Bennodkk: lol did priest just pi a warrior over a warlock
[2:55:46] Todmeister9000: KEKW
[2:55:47] cptrogers123: KEKW

[2:57:02] dkapocalypse: just say what shreck says NO DONKEY

[2:57:48] nephttv_: sharing the love
[2:57:51] Fyris57: health goes all over the place
[2:57:52] CrusaderNero: It doesnt matter. Everything with wow & Blizzard gotta be tested, alot.
[2:57:54] YardRage: eyyy I'm tankin heah
[2:57:58] NibzJamz: fukadaheee
[2:58:05] chabouy: @herraticc shouldn’t be healer should be tracking a BDK runic power not there health bar
[2:58:08] Strouss: DK tanks great tank but i hated healing them lol
[2:58:29] SeckSymbols: Half patches not necessarily. The only big thing is current ilvl raids which are already balanced quite well
[2:58:33] CritcobainTV: paper mache
[2:58:34] CrusaderNero: cloth Kappa
[2:58:34] Artivicii: Healing dk as a druid is fun af
[2:58:42] subversv: he paper boy
[2:58:42] Thoreya: cross faction works fine in 9.2.5..what else do they really need to test
[2:58:45] subversv: Kappa
[2:58:50] Jarwerewolf: lul
[2:58:50] h00rayforstuff: not hitting fade enough
[2:58:53] Thoreya: ptr*
[2:58:55] subversv: LUL
[2:58:57] Artivicii: He’s made out of vanilla
[2:58:57] Strouss: yeah on my druid when i heal DK i just do hot's, they got the rest anyhow lol
[2:59:05] cptrogers123: island boy, and im jsut tryna make it
[2:59:08] CrusaderNero: the real content is the PTR
[2:59:14] SeckSymbols: I keep trying to use the reply feature on twitwch but it never works LUL I don't think much is needed to test in 2.5
[2:59:16] subversv: dk with 4 set and DRW = immortal
[2:59:24] Fyris57: RIP
[2:59:40] Djfarmville: def need rune weapon for that pull
[2:59:50] Artivicii: towOof
[3:00:16] CrusaderNero: @SeckSymbols its Blizzard we are talking about LUL
[3:00:20] bob_the_demon: The earliest 9.2.5 releases is July/August.
[3:00:24] Artivicii: Easy
[3:00:27] nephttv_: urh+2 enrage kekw
[3:00:34] Pa1ntank: Urh debuffing you + healer doing 3k hps is reallty the thing lol
[3:00:40] SeckSymbols: @CrusaderNero You're not wrong, but what honestly needs to be extensively tested?
[3:00:43] CrusaderNero: august/sept is a likely scenario for 9.2.5
[3:00:43] Pa1ntank: could have lived that
[3:01:03] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[3:01:03] SeckSymbols: @CrusaderNero They're not going to go 6 months for a half patch
[3:01:11] WillWoW: monkaS
[3:01:12] bob_the_demon: Classic Wrath in Sept/Oct
[3:01:32] CrusaderNero: @SeckSymbols Theres most likely alot of technicalities to be cleared out, but besides that they also stagger content. It all depends on when 10.0 is planned launched. Same with WotLK. Ideally they want to overlap content
[3:01:33] SeckSymbols: Classic Wrath will likely be the stopgap between end of SL and beginning of DF
[3:01:45] Angxlic: lots of practicing releasing asap
[3:01:50] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning brother! @towelliee towHAMUP towLets towGo
[3:01:51] deadalon: I'm as exited for the new WoW expansion as watching my dog pooping.  He has diarrhea btw. :P
[3:01:54] CrusaderNero: @SeckSymbols I've experienced Blizzard doing 12+ months on bad patches LUL
[3:02:07] Artivicii: That healer is living the vanilla priest life
[3:02:17] Mike__Ro: he is low on phoenix plume lul
[3:02:17] SeckSymbols: @CrusaderNero As have I, but they aren't adding anything NEW in the new patch outside of cross faction shit
[3:02:23] subversv: you doing any more keys this morning?
[3:02:24] CrusaderNero: vanilla healing.. thats my jab Kappa
[3:02:25] Batenasi: go kyrian

[3:05:01] georgedavies1996: Do you think the reveal crossing over with reset is a coincidence?
[3:05:17] georgedavies1996: or we might see some stuff after reset
[3:05:19] xXSiebzehnXx: Almost there
[3:05:24] hookkz: i cant watch tmmrw cause of work FeelsGoodMan Clap
[3:05:28] Fyris57: prob not, will prob have some store stuff after reset
[3:05:32] Darthyrevan: itll be the new norm
[3:05:36] georgedavies1996: oh ok
[3:05:38] SeckSymbols: With E3 being dead and Blizzcon not happening in person for the forseeable future, its pretty great.
[3:05:39] Shrenko: @hookkz same.... IM PISSED 😡
[3:05:41] CrusaderNero: I regret not going years ago. now it just doesnt feel the same
[3:05:44] subversv: its coincidence
[3:05:54] georgedavies1996: I am so pumped
[3:05:55] PrimalRain: It's pretty fun this way, I 've usually watched the release with Lirik.
[3:06:11] Kisswani: I pre bought some tokens with gold for bnet balance KEKW
[3:06:15] WhiteKnight74648: It was awesome meeting you at blizzcon @Towelliee
[3:06:18] Bentzer87: @Towelliee There wont be a preorder tomorrow. It will just be strange becouse Shadowlands is on 50% sale up intill 24th? ...
[3:06:24] orizont2k: Hey Towelliee ! Do you think will be Dragonflight Expansion ? Personally I dont think so.... I think is not a natural direction of the story !
[3:06:35] shanks_blank: @Towelliee do you think they will announce a new class tomorrow ?
[3:06:38] SeckSymbols: Its practically confirmed
[3:06:49] XarkoLP: Blizz Con is prop for the most guys just a place to meet their favs youtbers / streamers
[3:06:49] xXSiebzehnXx: Since launch I have never got to go to a Blizzcon. Now I can go and they aren’t having them LUL
[3:06:51] SeckSymbols: If it isn't Dragonflight, then it was a bait by Blizzard
[3:07:03] Fyris57: itll be Dragonflight
[3:07:10] orizont2k: @SeckSymbols 100% bait from blizz
[3:07:23] Clodagh_Lunaria: @SeckSymbols some folk saying dragonflight is the mobile thing they mentioned but Im not so sure.
[3:07:36] Banjo586: thats bs 󠀀
[3:07:46] midax_77: @shanks_blank tal vez anuncien lich king
[3:07:51] orizont2k: is this 1 april again ? :)))
[3:07:51] Fyris57: dragon deez nuts
[3:07:52] Thoreya: hopium is real that 10.0 isnt dragonflight lmao
[3:08:01] duffluv22: But why would it look bad?
[3:08:13] Artivicii: Dragon deez nutz 4Head
[3:08:13] SeckSymbols: @orizont2k Out of curiosity, why is it not the natural direction for the story? Its better that they deescalate than try and continue on the cosmic path that they have failed on
[3:08:15] Banjo586: if it was a super fake leak, they would throw some off handed comment to say its not dragonflight 󠀀
[3:08:24] Domini1001: @Towelliee  going for aspects is literally "break glass in case of emergency" kind of theme everyone loves it and they really need to step up atm
[3:08:27] hookkz: i hope they dont try to connect it with previous expacs, oldschool style
[3:08:27] cptrogers123: is it weird, that i wanna play alts so bad, but when i think about all the shit i have to do, then its not really forfilling
[3:08:31] duffluv22: Noone guessed BFA
[3:08:32] shanks_blank: @Towelliee do you think they will announce a new class tomorrow ?
[3:08:34] bob_the_demon: Not with their current reputation with the players; a troll wouldn't go over well
[3:08:34] Strouss: Think the 6 month and Mount will be gone tomorrow? Replaced with something new?
[3:08:43] kyoone07: @Fille1809 i feel you KEKW
[3:08:48] orizont2k: @SeckSymbols hmmm but the build so much for void lords ? you think they will go to the little dragons ?
[3:08:52] SeckSymbols: @Domini1001 They already broke the glass in case of emergency by using ICC as a selling point for Shadowlands
[3:08:55] Strouss: Strouss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hammers Up

[3:09:40] n0rdberg83: Do you guys not have phones?
[3:09:43] SeckSymbols: All of the mounts they have released have ties to dragonland shit if Bellulars videos is anything to go off of
[3:09:44] MCSNAKEFACE: @Fille1809 if you already leveled your cov's alts are easy, the second leggo is cross faction and you can get renown to 80 in ZM quests.
[3:09:50] Domini1001: @SeckSymbols  nah its a teaser, last time they did that was with resurrection of Illidan, there was even a meme where guldan breaks illidan tomb and it says break glass in case of content drought xd
[3:09:54] Banjo586: it would be an out os season april fools joke Kappa 󠀀

[3:10:40] SeckSymbols: @Domini1001 No, using ICC as a selling point and stating that we are going to the place of death within the WoW universe where we could possibly see Arthas and a bunch of other dead fucks is pure emergency shit
[3:10:43] orizont2k: Overall I dont mind if is Dragon expension.... is just that they made so much of a setup for void lords and now to play with dragons.... i dont know...my common sense say no
[3:10:44] MaLaffy: seems like of small now haha
[3:10:49] yunitoYuniro: Murlocs has new race and bards new class

[3:11:51] Kisswani: @varutug they are alternative ways of gearing . dungeons can help gear you for raid , there is also a weekly reward for doing mythic+ dungeons
[3:11:52] shanks_blank: is it confirmed there will be new classes ?
[3:11:58] dkapocalypse: world of warcraft we dont give a fock
[3:12:03] Clodagh_Lunaria: @shanks_blank Nope

[3:14:00] MCSNAKEFACE: @Fille1809 you dont though, you can buy ash and cinders in ZM and send them to alts with bonesmith items, after doing intro quests in ZM you can buy all conduits at 226 with just friendly rep, and you can just farm rares and chests to get flux, was able to get 4k in a day on my alt pally
[3:14:08] Bentzer87: @Thoreya Hard to preorder when shadowlands is on 50% sale intill 25th April
[3:14:27] cptrogers123: @MCSNAKEFACE Damn i actually didnt know that, THANK you mate!
[3:14:58] Nowaayjose: the whole faction in 9.2 should be account wide smh

[3:16:17] Dyriks: omg all this time I didn't even think about looking at your bars until now. I thought you were playing a monk LOL
[3:16:18] MCSNAKEFACE: @Towelliee just like my stupid misjudged BM Clash in to sanguine
[3:16:31] Dyriks: I am blind
[3:16:44] Banjo586: @Fille1809 thats a pr dumb rule since getting revered is like a 1-2% power increase
[3:17:00] YardRage: NotLikeThis

[3:18:00] Breadpie: lichborne, you can dispell yourself
[3:18:36] Banjo586: @Fille1809 yeah, but not directly, you buy the item, use it on your main and then go to Korthia to buy the containers for alts 󠀀
[3:18:39] Triist0ne: if the tanks know what they're doing then most of the time regardless of tank spec, they heal more than the healer
[3:18:44] subversv: yeah sleeps charm and fear
[3:18:49] subversv: lichborne is amazing
[3:18:53] h00rayforstuff: an hpriest can put gs on you outside of your vamp and you're basically good. they wont' need to touch you
[3:19:23] QuigsTV: @Towelliee my mind was blown when I found out you can heal yourself with death coil after you use lichborne LUL
[3:19:37] QuigsTV: I actually didnt know that
[3:19:50] mmrghost7: wiped on the last boss of pf on a +20 he has 80k hp left :/

[3:21:26] Nokterian: When you have 4 piece set and two leggo's it is nuts
[3:21:29] Korupcija_: this guy is kinda trolling if he's not kyrian priest
[3:21:39] Specsifier: holy is just way easier to play. you gotta work a lot harder in disc and we all know wow players don't like to have to do more effort LUL
[3:21:41] nephttv_: @Korupcija_ they are nf
[3:21:48] b_ferd: disc isnt bad, holy is just better
[3:21:49] h00rayforstuff: disc absorbs don't do much and attonment doesn't heal what it needs to to compete
[3:21:52] Banjo586: holy priest does very decent dmg though, normally
[3:21:57] Nokterian: Resto Shamans are amazing
[3:22:06] Nokterian: double leggo is where its at

[4:15:48] Kurpto: @Ortinoth This is true and it would be nice for it releaser sooner than whats happened in the past
[4:16:18] darssia_: he streamed himself exploiting too. what a guy.
[4:16:18] Ortinoth: @Kurpto but in all reality i wouldn't expect till Decemeber to Early Feb 2023
[4:16:31] ILikeKillTheZombies: what if next expansion will be called "Sylvanas reunion" and it will be about nathanos and sylvanas love story
[4:16:38] faulen: is a DH tank more dmg mitigation or healing based (like dk) 󠀀
[4:17:45] aikopooh: total concentration mode
[4:18:05] ArchMystery: What's the add on that marks prios for you?
[4:18:22] faulen: that's a weak aura
[4:18:45] board4life65: you can skipp that pack you have mind soothe in the group

[4:19:50] smashwow: does a ton of healing
[4:19:59] 91Niki: Yeah don't use the exploit to wear more leggos than you're supposed to. Unless you want a vacation from wow LUL
[4:20:29] pumpsxc: you wont
[4:20:30] CritcobainTV: you can do it if u can hold threat KEKW
[4:21:04] Llamatude: @91Niki people are doing that and thinking its ok?
[4:21:16] 91Niki: @Llamatude People are stupid, what can i say
[4:21:17] LiveFromStua: I mean how is it bannable, it\s blizz fault they left that option up
[4:21:33] pumpsxc: all exploits are bannable lol
[4:21:39] Sollice: @LiveFromStua Because you know its a bug
[4:21:40] Llamatude: @Llamatude they will be the same people saying they did nothing and dont know why they are banned.
[4:21:45] CritcobainTV: @LiveFromStua Because its' a bug that's not menat to be done, wdym LUL
[4:21:47] 91Niki: Yeah but it is very clearly an exploit, so if you kee doing it, it is on you
[4:21:53] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee https://twitter.com/jasonxdrofl/status/1515818875320946691/photo/1
[4:21:56] faulen: yeah, in every slot 󠀀
[4:21:57] CritcobainTV: He streamed himself doing it on mythic jailer
[4:21:59] darssia_: a guy from Golden guardians.
[4:22:00] Metket: hahahaha yes
[4:22:06] Dyasis: iKB on Illidan lol 󠀀 󠀀
[4:22:08] Rudric_Ice: 7 legos
[4:22:09] ContraRob: Apparently the extra leggo effects don't apply, but you do get the higher ilvl
[4:22:11] Metket: ban all guild
[4:22:14] PYRO_MANI8C: dont do it quick ban, I got smoked by someone in arena doing it yesterday
[4:22:16] ThePawPaw: THANOS did that KEKW
[4:22:17] darssia_: he killed mythic jailer with it.
[4:22:21] Todmeister9000: so, apparently you don't get the legendary effects it's just ilvl and stats?
[4:22:23] CritcobainTV: it's just for the stats of 291, it's insane lol
[4:22:29] flebbooo: true, whole guild should get banned if they got the kill for it
[4:22:31] tydrennistv: Technically can’t hunters wear 3 with the bow
[4:22:36] Rudric_Ice: who exposed the guy ?
[4:22:43] nephttv_: those adds dont show up on meters
[4:22:47] Dyasis: he streamed it lol
[4:22:50] CritcobainTV: i linked it
[4:22:52] darssia_: @rudric_ice himself lol. he streamed it.
[4:23:01] TrixStar36: Felinator was doing it
[4:23:04] PYRO_MANI8C: there were a few people doing it icy veins put out a post about it
[4:23:09] Llamatude: hes 283 ilevel.. wtf?
[4:23:23] 91Niki: Can't wait to see the upset kids on reddit after they get banned for wearing 7 leggos KEKW
[4:24:00] aikopooh: well its ganno be funny
[4:24:04] PoppaMetal: @Rudric_Ice its 2022 MF's expose themselves lol
[4:24:06] darssia_: golden guardians all knew about it too and still killed mythic jailer. literally why.
[4:24:21] CritcobainTV: @Rudric_Ice Dude literally streamed it
[4:24:23] mayonaes: @Towelliee Do you have a favorite coffee?
[4:24:32] Sollice: He doesnt drink coffee really
[4:24:36] Sollice: Heathen
[4:24:43] mayonaes: wut
[4:24:48] CritcobainTV: @Sollice Do u have a favorite coffee?
[4:24:58] Sollice: Any with burbon in it
[4:24:59] mayonaes: Coffee is natures fuel
[4:25:02] mayonaes: Kappa
[4:25:03] Mitune: So ya think tomorrow is gonna just be a trailer and thats it or a more semi indepth sorta like Blizz con?
[4:25:04] just_laxus: towelliee gfuel flavour when ?
[4:25:05] realnzall: Will you be restreaming the announcement tomorrow?
[4:25:14] PToastman: hot bean juice
[4:25:14] Sollice: I like Lavazza
[4:25:25] zerkx1: @pumpsxc exploits like being able to wear 7 leggos are the fault of the developers and shouldn't be a bannable offense unless it's used for griefing. which I can't think of how you can.
[4:25:27] nephttv_: I think my details name is fitting
[4:25:27] CritcobainTV: i've never drank coffee.
[4:25:29] AureliusXV: gfuel KEKW
[4:25:41] Rudric_Ice: hows the matrix flavor ?
[4:25:42] HaxzorJimDuggan: some of that fancy gourmet shit
[4:25:44] sampit: but like
[4:25:44] mayonaes: they have a coffee flavor gfuel right? perhaps i should try it
[4:26:01] sampit: if you go to bed and take a 8 hour nap, time will go faster, aren't you like, excited for tomorrow
[4:26:01] Moobot: World of Wacraft 10.0 Expansion LEAKED ON MAIN SITE! Could be deflection? Mebbe? THRE BE DRAGONS! https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-expansion-leaks-on-blizzard-website-326583 We are doing a 24 stream for the expansion announcement. Be here!
[4:26:04] smashwow: towelliee getting ready for that alpha release.
[4:26:11] CritcobainTV: @pumpsxc It's used to progress and kill a boss you're stuck on, knowing full well that its not intended. They're abusing the bug by doing it to clear content, which is bannable
[4:26:14] smashwow: and new playable character
[4:26:17] newwayz92: I like your stream ^^
[4:26:18] barefoot_on_bricks: Any realistic thoughts on a 10.0 official release date?
[4:26:23] EmperorFredd: 11pm what timezone is that in?
[4:26:29] smashwow: PST
[4:26:38] EmperorFredd: Thanks
[4:26:39] pumpsxc: correct :p
[4:26:42] smashwow: or PDT since we're in spring
[4:26:51] Domini1001: @Towelliee  you gotta help stepbro
[4:26:53] AureliusXV: @barefoot_on_bricks why would you care they havent even announced it yet lol not for a while
[4:26:58] Rustofer: what time is the reveal?
[4:27:06] ofendedorazo: yo hit the gym
[4:27:06] CritcobainTV: Help him stepbro, he's stuck monkaS
[4:27:08] PoppaMetal: I cant see myself coming back unless maybe a new class is announced
[4:27:09] muertashaman: why is this bot posting 2 weeks old news ffs
[4:27:15] muertashaman: goddamn clickbait
[4:27:15] Sollice: @pumpsxc This is why it's called a bug and welcome to any game in the past 10 years. Especially LIVE service games. You know your not suppose to do it
[4:27:24] Rudric_Ice: 9 am is pretty early for an announcment
[4:27:27] swordart2022: @poppametal then don't
[4:27:30] zerkx1: @Critcobain if you can't get banned for glitching out a boss then you shouldn't get banned for wearing 7 leggos. it's that simple
[4:27:45] muertashaman: it's 9am so we in europe also have it a t a normal time
[4:27:46] Mitune: chances are febuary of next year would be my guess @barefoot_on_bricks
[4:27:48] Rustofer: @rudric_ice tk u
[4:28:29] Sollice: Any Havoc DH mains here? I am going to play WoW again and I hear I can leave Night Fae and go Venthyr?
[4:28:42] JediNeo99999: @zerkx1 You do get banned for intentionally bugging a boss. The issue isn't if you know the bug exists but if you take advantage of the bug. If you discover you could wear multiple legos and you tell blizzard and don't use them it's fine.
[4:28:42] pumpsxc: venth is the paly
[4:28:50] nephttv_: @Sollice go ven
[4:28:55] Sollice: Thank god
[4:28:55] Todmeister9000: @Sollice for ST yeah
[4:29:05] swordart2022: I am kyrian havoc playing dash build
[4:29:06] Sollice: I am so tired of NF. Between DH and Hunter
[4:29:09] BubblePriest: a lot
[4:29:11] Korupcija_: 9
[4:29:18] Shearkahn: Thoghts on when WOTLK drops?
[4:29:21] Sollice: Oh...I'm not good enough for Momentum builds lol
[4:29:22] Reiumi_: guzuNotes
[4:29:25] raldrik: end of january
[4:29:37] 91Niki: If you're defending the leggo exploit, you're clearing exploiting it yourself. You can't convince me otherwise LUL
[4:29:40] mavericks312: late january is a safe bet
[4:29:41] nielefs: i think beta in june and release febr/martch
[4:29:43] generaljosh721: Did you already fill out your bingo card?
[4:29:47] pumpsxc: facts momentum builds requires thinking which i dont do
[4:29:52] Rudric_Ice: im guess early feb
[4:29:53] zerkx1: @Sollice roll with the bone bois
[4:29:55] Korupcija_: ye but I'm on hopium
[4:30:02] rtucker04: @Towelliee said this xpac would but a lot different during NW stream.  Can't wait till he's right, the hype is realllll
[4:30:07] Rudric_Ice: guessing*
[4:30:09] swordart2022: @pumpsxc lol just aim yourself xD
[4:30:10] Jokervenom1978: Im hoping to be playing some Wrath during the draught.
[4:30:15] Orirholim: I'm guessing that entire guild will get their mythic jailer achievement taken away if Blizzard does anything.
[4:30:18] Sollice: Necro? Did they improve the soul binds?
[4:30:22] tragx: We also have to take into account that their announcement might have been delayed by various factors. So if the situation is sufficiently different, looking at past data might not be that informative.
[4:31:00] Mitune: Im all chill with a later expansion release especially if they delay due to responding to feed back in the beta for once
[4:31:06] EmperorFredd: Is there any way to upgrade the leggo you get for completing the ZM campaign
[4:31:08] Orirholim: @tragx wasnt' blizzcon supposed to be last year? we probably would've gotten expansion information then, they've probably been working on this expansion for a bit
[4:31:15] rtucker04: Dungeons the most effect way to level currently?
[4:31:28] Hinsonn: @EmperorFredd Yes
[4:31:33] Thoreya: yall ready for that invoker class announced tomorrow? lmaooo
[4:31:35] swordart2022: @emperorfredd put it to runecarver?
[4:31:43] Ortinoth: @rtucker04 fastest way is to do the quests - if your not a tank or healer
[4:31:52] swordart2022: @rtucker04 no
[4:31:53] lithium364: he knows Kappa
[4:31:54] JediNeo99999: You can't upgrade the free lego from ZM
[4:31:55] ThePawPaw: what is Invoker
[4:31:57] Mitune: Tinkerer is way better imo
[4:31:57] Yetik: sorry but what is an invoker ? LUL
[4:31:59] rtucker04: @Ortinoth thank you :D
[4:32:00] mavericks312: evoker is just a fancy mage
[4:32:00] Yagr6: shaman tank plz
[4:32:02] Obmxtiny: Kappa 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:32:04] Orirholim: I doubt it's Invoker. People will probably riot lol.
[4:32:05] fewyn: wait
[4:32:07] ContraRob: There are evokers in the game alrady
[4:32:07] cappei: As long as it's not a Stinker, I'm all good
[4:32:08] fewyn: what's invoker?
[4:32:09] pumpsxc: yeah agree it doesnt sound very WoW themed
[4:32:11] Phil87z: Tinkerer now is the time lol
[4:32:12] Mitune: @JagrZero THIS
[4:32:12] Kdog8t7: Invoker is a Dota hero
[4:32:13] Rudric_Ice: Invoker ?
[4:32:16] Rudric_Ice: dota ?
[4:32:16] Holybytheway: I dont think they're gonna annoucne a new class
[4:32:18] Holybytheway: tbh
[4:32:20] warrenny: Do we need a new class
[4:32:21] Orirholim: evoker/invoker whatever it is
[4:32:22] RetiredNavyVet: BARD! the the power chords!!!!
[4:32:24] swordart2022: Chat got baited Kappa
[4:32:27] Hotspotsz: reckon there will be a new class tho?
[4:32:31] tragx: @Orirholim That's my thinking. Blizzcon didn't happen, so that might have delayed their announcement, together with the allegations. They are cutting Shadowlands short obviously, so they might want to attempt a November release to get back on the 2 year release schedule.
[4:32:38] Donswag3: @EmperorFredd You can buy the memory of unity once you're revered rep with the Enlightened and you can craft it to 291
[4:32:39] Bennodkk: there's enough classes in wow we dont need more
[4:32:40] Koperniiik: I hope for robot tank
[4:32:43] lithium364: heavy metal themed bard which shots lightning from his E gitarre
[4:32:49] Sollice: I dont think we are going to get a new class
[4:32:54] Orirholim: @tragx Hmm. November would be crazy. I'm thinking December/January
[4:33:00] RetiredNavyVet: obviously, the new class is Dragonrider
[4:33:04] temp3st98: but what we need is a new race Kappa
[4:33:09] darssia_: I just want one new ranged spec, but yeah I doubt new class.
[4:33:15] Mitune: agreed @Sollice Though I do hope we get some new specs maybe
[4:33:25] Youredoneson666: if we don't get a new class i'ma be REAL sad.
[4:33:26] 3663Sharad: He dead monkaS
[4:33:31] pumpsxc: LUL
[4:33:33] maccaruso: Oh boy
[4:33:35] swordart2022: @temp3st98 Cat girls and Dragon girls YEP
[4:33:52] tragx: @Orirholim That's plausible, too. I guess we'll see tomorrow. :D
[4:33:53] Yetik: clutch monkaS

[4:34:01] Rudric_Ice: so we getting invoker in WoW now ? can't wait to bash my head on the wall to learn him
[4:34:05] Carahail: healer was bad ass
[4:34:06] Kisswani: Clean EZ Clap
[4:34:07] Todmeister9000: we don't need new classes in wow
[4:34:19] Rexy95: and u got a orb
[4:34:29] Rexy95: or nvm
[4:34:32] Dyasis: I'm kinda hoping no new class 󠀀 󠀀
[4:34:33] Orirholim: @tragx if the expansion is PogChad tomorrow, going to be a lot of resubscriptions and expansion pre-purchases assuming that goes up tomorrow
[4:34:33] raldrik: Id be happy with a few new specs for existing classes
[4:34:43] Sollice: Wait I forget
[4:34:54] Sollice: if I have anima do i need to get those tokens before i switch covenenants
[4:35:12] cevyr1: yeah you do
[4:35:18] jaina8675309: be nice if we get more bank space
[4:35:19] swordart2022: @sollice if you want to have it in different yes
[4:35:26] Sollice: Ok ty
[4:35:27] 3663Sharad: @Sollice anima will be left behind after you hanged
[4:36:02] racketpunch: I hope healers go back in the direction of just healing, not having to worry about how much dps we put out
[4:36:12] Thoreya: apparently Cali is trying to do 4 day work weeks instead of 5? thats cool
[4:36:17] PhillyDilly18: @racketpunch 10000000000000%
[4:36:31] Nokterian: gg
[4:36:35] tragx: @Orirholim Definitely. I can't see it not being hype, tbh. The negatives of an expansion usually become apparent in the closed tests. Unless they make a major blunder with where the story is going, I don't think they really can screw up an announcement.
[4:36:42] lithium364: i agree i dont wanna min max dps as healer
[4:36:47] swordart2022: @racketpunch go play classic bboomer
[4:36:52] Kisswani: towDynt
[4:36:58] racketpunch: Lol
[4:36:59] SyWr: hello
[4:37:00] Yagr6: @Towelliee make blizz do shaman tank spec plz and thank you
[4:37:12] Orirholim: @tragx true, i'll pre-order tomorrow if it pops
[4:37:18] zulway_: hundefick192
[4:37:21] Gotxiko: we dont need more classes
[4:37:26] Gennzo: tinker lets go
[4:37:27] Nokterian: A new healing class plx
[4:37:29] Rudric_Ice: can't wait for danuser to explain the new WoW saga KEKW
[4:37:29] mmrghost7: we need one , we need a refreshment
[4:37:29] Aervyper: i liked the idea of the 4 mini classes it's a great idea
[4:37:33] BlastingHookTTV: new class specsss
[4:37:34] MarquisLek: shaman tank!
[4:37:36] ryanmoss35: A NEW MAIL CLASS
[4:37:38] maalow: new class = more dead specs
[4:37:39] Coriollis: wotlk, mop, legion , hmmm
[4:37:40] PvtHudson093: new class is a big hook to bring in the people that left
[4:37:45] jarilrpg: class skins
[4:37:46] Obmxtiny: tinker would be dope.. tank dps healer PogChamp 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:37:46] raldrik: I want the earth tank shammy
[4:37:49] Thoreya: im always for new shit. cool ideas >>> perfect balance
[4:37:51] Donswag3: player housing is the biggest thing for me - adding more collection grinding/aesthetics would be great for their sub count too
[4:37:53] szble: I mean another class fantasy in our expansive world i think is great 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:37:53] cappei: Fact is every single expac with a new class are the ones that are praised for the best class design. Wrath, MoP, Legion. But I'm sure that's just a coincidence LuL
[4:37:53] darssia_: I just don't think there's my dream class or spec yet, kind of want something new.
[4:37:53] amricatt: I would prefer more specs rather than a new class.
[4:37:56] Technogre: fix the actual game before adding new classes and specs
[4:37:57] HaloS23: @Towelliee skip the class IMO... Id take a playable Dragonborne race
[4:38:00] nezz231: we already got alot of dead specs, fix the one they have plz
[4:38:01] jaina8675309: need more toon space got 50 toons allready
[4:38:05] Coriollis: I mean new classes came with the best xpacks
[4:38:05] MetalJoshP: Let’s get our existing classes “balanced” and improved maybe a new spec and spells
[4:38:06] enceo9: new ranged class if any
[4:38:08] Draz3nx: we need a healer class if anything
[4:38:08] Ortinoth: i
[4:38:09] PvtHudson093: we need a mail wearing class
[4:38:11] Eviltuna13: New race/class combos will be nice
[4:38:13] theaccountant219: think we need to eliminate some specs and then add another class with two specs
[4:38:13] temp3st98: dps healer maybe
[4:38:14] Thoreya: new spellcaster man
[4:38:16] mmrghost7: i'm down for a new tank class
[4:38:17] ContraRob: they've never added a ranged dps
[4:38:18] Aervyper: give me a bard so i can laugh at the people that main bard
[4:38:20] generaljosh721: I would take better class design over a new class with shitty designed classes
[4:38:21] ZealotryTV: Ranged Survival back and called Dark Ranger plz thx
[4:38:22] swordart2022: If it doesn't plays and feel different doesn't matter
[4:38:22] KShellZx: Hunter Tank spec!
[4:38:24] duffluv22: @towelliee What would you like to see in the new expansion???
[4:38:25] enceo9: but id rather have new specs... gimme my tank shaman

[4:38:30] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee We need another mail class if something is coming up, race, why not
[4:38:30] Tokies: when you play healer or tank guilds expect you to be able to play any healer or tank well. it's a lot
[4:38:31] love_eggplant: Dragonmancer
[4:38:31] Rudric_Ice: i dont want a race i want A CLASS
[4:38:33] pumpsxc: new race id be down for, new class would be err...
[4:38:37] Kisswani: Fus Roh Dah
[4:38:38] Coriollis: shaman and lock tanks here we come :)
[4:38:38] Angxlic: Dark ranger!
[4:38:39] m4ldrock: tinker is coming
[4:38:41] mizerboy: He knows.....there won't be a new class
[4:38:42] NineOneSixGod: New specs for existing classes imo
[4:38:43] swordart2022: Dragon girls confirmed YEP
[4:38:44] szble: FeelsBadMan new class deniers
[4:38:45] QuigsTV: @Towelliee ty for the key man. I had fun and gl on your vaults tomorrow.
[4:38:46] ShadoodHD: SPEAKING OF CLASSES.... there's too many of them
[4:38:51] Qelvue: why settle for one? maybe two classes, two race? ;O
[4:38:55] darssia_: I want a blood mage.
[4:38:57] Nokterian: KEKW
[4:38:58] mmrghost7: no new class for 3 expansion back to back its gonna stink
[4:38:58] Hitokiri83: renown

[4:39:16] Rudric_Ice: if no new CLASS at least add some NEW specs for some classes
[4:39:16] Nokterian: A new healing class is a warm welcome
[4:39:16] CanadianCataclysm: Bring on the Necromancer that is the Mail wearing armor type who is the DPS / Healing class. Along with it being some Dragon race that is like how panda class started.
[4:39:24] NineOneSixGod: Existing classes should get new specs like hero specs
[4:39:28] NineOneSixGod: Hunter for dark ranger spec idk
[4:39:28] Obmxtiny: shaman tank would be dope as well
[4:39:28] mmrghost7: @enceo9 i can go for it
[4:39:29] SyWr: dont know if its coinsidence but, pandaria = new race/class people loved expansion.  warlords = people hated it.  legion = new class people loved it.  bfa = nothing hated it. shadowlands nothing people hated it
[4:39:34] nephttv_: instead of a new class, maybe idk...Fix the current ones?
[4:39:34] Mitune: Id would love new specs but ill take anything as long as it is fun

[4:39:56] JediNeo99999: @SyWr People were not very happy with legion until 7.3 though
[4:40:01] Tokies: I hope it's not player housing. I want a solid expasion that focus on classes.

[4:40:16] lithium364: it will be an hypermobile range class which will make all other range classes redundant
[4:40:21] Mitune: Monk just felt good to play as well. Super smooth compared to others at the time
[4:40:22] SyWr: @JediNeo99999 numbers say the other
[4:40:24] Banjo586: monk still the least played class by far
[4:40:28] Coriollis: I want a DH healing tree , MY SCARS SHALL HEAL YOU!!!

[4:41:30] HaloS23: thats why i think its going to be more dragon race vs class
[4:41:31] falldrgn: OOOH.. think dragon knight with old Demo warlock  where you could turn into a dragon.
[4:41:31] cahoots82: Streets has gotten better
[4:41:34] swervo61: I feel like blizzard is gonna treat making a new class how you were talking about leveling cap being raised. It’s just something they’ve done and will probably continue to do
[4:41:35] Banjo586: streets is fun after the nerfs 󠀀
[4:41:35] warrenny: @fewyn Dragon themed formswould be great?
[4:41:35] QuigsTV: streets is ez
[4:41:35] lithium364: why not guardians deal more damage then feral anyway now lmao
[4:41:38] Tokies: removing feral druids... I play that. Sometimes the truth hurts
[4:41:40] nephttv_: I will give you a very solid maybe @Towelliee
[4:41:42] ProfJeffs: Just give Druid a dragon flight mode @towelliee
[4:41:43] ZealotryTV: why do people want new classes that can do all 3 roles? is it really necessary
[4:41:44] OhNoNotAgain: streets isnt bad anymore id say
[4:41:48] mmrghost7: a class that can swap between dragon and humanoind
[4:41:53] Stonefather: Dragon race would be weird
[4:41:54] MleveK: Dragon Druid :O
[4:41:56] ShadoodHD: dragon knight? let's be honest there's too many goddam classes in the goddam game /s
[4:41:57] QuigsTV: @Towelliee i can lower my Plaguefall to a 15
[4:42:00] Coriollis: Dragonborn in woW should be cool
[4:42:00] cahoots82: @ZealotryTV People just want something new
[4:42:02] Kisswani: @ZealotryTV new stuff is always exciting
[4:42:04] Nokterian: Dwagon anniesAw
[4:42:17] AveragePvp: @towelliee same as worgen style maybe?
[4:42:19] Rudric_Ice: add a Dragon Warrior
[4:42:25] lithium364: imagine an triple DPS spec class
[4:42:27] ShadoodHD: dragonborn?? DOVAHKIN
[4:42:32] Sore1: my hail mary is that itll be a 4 spec class combing the 5 aspects with their respective roles
[4:42:40] Aertharion: dont think i could play healer now as haven't played healer since MoP
[4:42:42] szble: leaked 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:42:46] SyWr: @Towelliee something between hunter and priest... the only thing i can say as an example is the tyrande... or something like her
[4:42:46] PvtHudson093: it needs to be a mail wearing class
[4:42:47] mayonaes: Invoker could invoke a dragon spirit to tank for them?
[4:42:48] Youredoneson666: invoker confirmed. heard it here first 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:42:49] BoomSquad41: He said invoker. Confirmed
[4:42:52] swordart2022: Doubt they ever cared for who will play it.
[4:42:52] szeeman62: @towelliee Warden class based on what aspect you align with the role changes ;black dragon-2 handed tank, green healer, red hybrid heal/dps, bronze time based dps
[4:42:56] Obmxtiny: dh range spec would have been cool as well
[4:43:00] mmrghost7: i want a class iwth 5 tank specs
[4:43:03] MarquisLek: its like a druid but dragon
[4:43:04] Nokterian: that is to much 2 specs at most
[4:43:04] Tokies: What if shaman got a earth tank spec?
[4:43:06] MetalJoshP: If there is a new dragonborn class it needs to be a 3 spec with all three represented
[4:43:06] szble: can they use invoker thought with dota?
[4:43:07] AveragePvp: @pvthudson093 agreed
[4:43:08] zigzugg: The new expac is WoW Back For Azerite
[4:43:13] Opelfruit: do you think they will rlease a 3rd DH spec later on at somepint ?
[4:43:13] mavericks312: they cant balance the 37 classes they have now
[4:43:15] Todmeister9000: is Ion going to present the new expac?
[4:43:16] ShadoodHD: or have a multi class hybrid system to fuck around with right? :D
[4:43:19] mayonaes: Invoker and the three specs are them invoking the spirit of a different dragon
[4:43:20] Cabbageman007: Thoughts on player housing
[4:43:21] xXSiebzehnXx: 4 new specs, fuck it
[4:43:21] Coriollis: but Meaningfull ChoicE
[4:43:22] jerexify: @Towelliee In your opinion, any chance they make it to where all races can be all classes?
[4:43:22] swervo61: All I know is when 10.0 comes out I wanna see the sub notification get broken like tbc launch
[4:43:23] ashwing_: Invoker is this Dota ?
[4:43:28] lithium364: you could say the same about covenant powers tho, impossible to balance
[4:43:32] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Warden class would work as someone said up there, mail armor, dragon themed, it could work
[4:43:34] warrenny: @topersan No doubt
[4:43:37] mikhaeld277: i mean if u have only 1 spec you dont have to share class spells and u can concentrate on having cool stuff i guess
[4:43:38] yuvalal: I hope if there is new class it will be dps/healer specs or tank/healer specs only
[4:43:38] Mitune: id take fun over balance but thats just me
[4:43:39] DeanoTV: most altoholics that have been playing for years have played most the classes
[4:43:40] Youredoneson666: Lets just go Ascension wow style, classless WoW
[4:43:41] szble: the balance argument is a dead horse at this point
[4:44:01] dougefreshhhh: if its a dragon based class, it needs to be a lancer. spear and shield class, ranged dps with javelin throw, healer is avatar-type with wind/fire healing
[4:44:09] lilwird_o7: murloc expansion: March of the Murlics
[4:44:12] tigzie: I cant stand that argument about balance. They can't balance anything at all, just have fun with it
[4:44:20] warrenny: @youredoneson666 Hell no
[4:44:22] lithium364: an ranged Spear class would be dope
[4:44:25] Gennzo: covid 2.0 inc
[4:44:26] raye_gaming22: balancing is not hard they need to colect combatlogs and add or substract numbers thats it
[4:44:26] Zolare: you mean microsoft walking into blizzard department and say we need to make money we spent a lot on your ass.
[4:44:28] cappei: The game wasn't balanced without DKs. It will never be balanced, doesn't matter the number of classes, so it's a shit argument
[4:44:29] Coriollis: I hope they went with every class is broken in new xpack but because they are broken each has its fun niche
[4:44:29] unowncreature: I mean its not like it wasn't hard to balance before DH, Monk, and DK im sure... so they would most likely put out another just for hype aspect
[4:44:32] SyWr: what about a class / spec like tyrande... a priest with a bow or melee short swords
[4:44:38] love_eggplant: wow needs an updated ui please
[4:44:41] szble: it shouldn't be either or 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:44:46] fistofnature: updated classes would be nice
[4:44:55] jerexify: @Towelliee In your opinion, any chance they make it to where all races can be all classes?
[4:44:55] swordart2022: Dragon Girls HYPE
[4:44:58] dougefreshhhh: @lithium364 right? lol it would be a dope ranged class.
[4:44:59] Thoreya: itd be just such a shame if they have cool ass ideas for classes and just dont add them for "balancing reasons"
[4:45:01] mavericks312: or make allied races a .2 or .3 patch
[4:45:01] kimmo_gaming: Dragon aspects would be like covenants , simple as that, meaningful choice
[4:45:01] dougefreshhhh: if its a dragon based class, it needs to be a lancer. spear and shield class, ranged dps with javelin throw, healer is avatar-type with wind/fire healing
[4:45:02] Crowharrick: "past pandemic status" YEP
[4:45:02] Sore1: Have they ever said why they dont do a recoulored armor set for m+ seasons for cosmetics
[4:45:03] Lamyth: also, new classes are better for marketing
[4:45:05] Thoreya: imo
[4:45:05] Rudric_Ice: We will all get to know about class or no class tomorrow
[4:45:07] Youredoneson666: @Towelliee you think we'll keep the same talent tree or something newish? 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:45:07] darckone: they need to go back to how what people loved about the game in the first place and sstop the gimmicky systems
[4:45:14] temp3st98: THICC dragon girls LUL
[4:45:15] dranet11: expansion announcement is at the start of my raid

[4:45:37] swordart2022: @darckone classic for bboomere go play
[4:45:38] Stonefather: Imagine an expansion without twent new systems danSad
[4:45:41] comp1: hype is real
[4:45:42] Qelvue: @Towelliee Maybe we free an orc that then timetravels and tries to invade us?
[4:45:51] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee what time is the show tomorrow?
[4:45:55] MetalJoshP: Facts for this expansion I’d rather have all those improvements to the gameplay itself before a class id almost rather see a class come through the story narrative towards the end of the xpac or in final patch before next expansion (11.0)
[4:45:57] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Say it with a spanish accent, its Paulito Kappa
[4:45:58] swordart2022: @stonefather go play classic Enjoy
[4:46:00] Stonefather: I mean one would be fine, but when you're stacking six of them.
[4:46:02] kaze171: NOOOOO Power
[4:46:09] mavericks312: aspect power , tier sets
[4:46:10] KythosMeltdown: Hey towellie how do i force my SO to play wow
[4:46:11] Phil87z: I’m hoping for a design philosophy update more than just a new class. Let’s get constant time walking, maybe badge gear
[4:46:13] mmrghost7: just dont fk up like covenants
[4:46:14] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @dougefreshhhh (warning)
[4:46:15] tragx: I'd be down for account-wide aspect power.
[4:46:15] Phil87z: Copy 14
[4:46:20] Coriollis: is there a bingo card for tomorrow's announcement ?
[4:46:20] Thepalestino: Aspect power
[4:46:27] Stonefather: @fairplay2021 I don't want to play Classic.
[4:46:27] Rudric_Ice: can't wait for 100 currencies in the next xpac KEKW
[4:46:27] MetalJoshP: True!
[4:46:28] TurtlesAndChill: Cheer100 Just wanted to let you know Oliver was born on that very same day <3 Thanks for providing something to watch during labor @Towelliee <3
[4:46:36] AkA_Palex: k
[4:46:37] Fallensinner_: As a Ret Paladin I'd prefer to just see class/spec reworks for the majority of classes.
[4:46:37] Garrujak: If there's another convuluted covenant-style choice then it's curetains for the whole expac
[4:46:38] board4life65: whats the issues with soulbinds and conduit?
[4:46:39] darckone: people also love to play alts the xpac should be alt friendly from the get go
[4:46:43] Hotspotsz: acount wide everything is highest on my wish list this exp
[4:46:54] swordart2022: @board4life65 none
[4:46:55] ShadoodHD: congrats TurtlesAndChill towPog towHAMUP
[4:46:56] HaloS23: @Towelliee Id be stoked if they were to revamp profs!!!
[4:47:02] temp3st98: i could see like a legion weapon type of borrowed power, maybe artifact back?
[4:47:02] thelordlongshaft: I hope there is no new class, they cannot balance what is in the game already asmonBoy
[4:47:09] nephttv_: @Towelliee Do i go on alt? I might stay alive longer LOL
[4:47:13] oSirKnight: oSirKnight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[4:47:14] Coriollis: uhh can u pls post it on twitter or idk xD
[4:47:20] Theduskflyer: Would you prefer RNG drop Leggos? Or would you like them to stick with the build your own?
[4:47:26] swordart2022: @thelordlongshaft go play chess EZ
[4:47:40] Domini1001: @Towelliee  but MoP was fun without all taht ashit
[4:47:51] TrixStar36: Peeps are gonna miss these cov powers lol
[4:47:57] Metket: meaningfull aspect choices
[4:47:58] BlueBeast33: Or...just make a class themed around it like DK's and Monks
[4:48:01] Sore1: I dont think there will be legendaries this time around since its always been every other expac in the past
[4:48:04] Thoreya: @thelordlongshaft then what is the difference if they add one? lol
[4:48:05] PvtHudson093: I want a new talent row that includes Divine Toll in that row
[4:48:06] Sore1: aside from last patch stuff
[4:48:07] maalow: just making the rep/currency grinds account wide would be a huge improvement to the game
[4:48:10] mavericks312: im ready for Cov's 2.0
[4:48:10] QuigsTV: its haste
[4:48:13] cipusanx: yea, old expansions did not have AP and it was more than fine
[4:48:17] Garrujak: One power is okay, but it and reputation better had be the ONLY things to grind. Fuck time gating, fuck systems within the system, and fuck punishing players who play different content
[4:48:19] Stonefather: If they just did something like artifacts or corruptions I would be fun, but when you throw in Azerite gear neck powers etc etc things start getting taxing.
[4:48:24] SyWr: there are a lot potential class/specs could added  rangers moon priestesses tinkerers etc etc
[4:48:26] danimoto10: danimoto10 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! lets gooo

[4:48:32] Fallensinner_: Didn't MoP have a new talent row too?
[4:48:38] darckone: powers are great
[4:48:38] Thoreya: game would be so fucking barebones without it
[4:48:40] Dyasis: mop had lego cloak... 󠀀 󠀀
[4:48:44] ShadoodHD: like the covenant system with locked storyline and limited options like the talent system Kappa
[4:48:52] Domini1001: @Towelliee  please dont say taht, i feel old :(
[4:48:56] darckone: just don't lock it like the covenants
[4:48:57] warrenny: @mavericks312 All the great ones did wierd that
[4:48:57] swordart2022: Bboomere in chat KEKW

[4:49:03] jaina8675309: mop was 10 years ago
[4:49:05] Kakotan2143: @Towelliee well Blizzard could do a brand new card game for in game to be the selling point of the eXpack PrideShrug
[4:49:10] raldrik: yeah look at how long people stick around and play classic. Fun for a bit but dies faster than SL did
[4:49:19] BlueBeast33: I mean it's not like MoP was BC or something...
[4:49:20] Stonefather: I like moving forward but thus far moving forward the last two expansions have been rough Keepo
[4:49:21] ShadoodHD: fine then, WoD garrison system lesgoo
[4:49:24] Gingerprimer: Yeah Tank threat in classic kind of fund tank threat during keys in retail now cursed shit
[4:49:33] George2001k: If the release date for the expansion is like in April, I will cry.
[4:49:34] swordart2022: @kakotan2143 Hearthstone playable in wow would be Pog
[4:49:57] Nokterian: Earth ele died to damn fast
[4:50:04] Metket: tow should play enhance this season
[4:50:07] swordart2022: @kakotan2143 someone seen ESO stream KEKW
[4:50:08] Nokterian: i keep using them on bosses
[4:50:42] maalow: hope they save some covenant spells like kyrian for arcane mage or divine toll for paladins
[4:51:10] Kakotan2143: @fairplay2021 gladdKEKW YOU Know it :D I have it pre ordered but im not happy for the card game as the selling point lol
[4:51:30] jarilrpg: @Towelliee do you think there is anything they can take from FFXIV? making old content relevant, new crafted geared right before mythic (to help with splits), and more ways to help with bad luck with gearing (tokens?) are the ones i hope they take something from
[4:51:42] Phil87z: What’s your take on player housing? People really seem divided on it
[4:51:51] swordart2022: @kakotan2143 card game looked like crap with bad rules imo
[4:52:09] lithium364: they should just steal the heavensward story for dragonflight 4Head
[4:52:14] Orirholim: @jarilrpg group finder from FFXIV would be great, make all dungeons/raids relevant
[4:52:36] Kakotan2143: @fairplay2021 yep
[4:52:52] warrenny: @orirholim Why tho soloing old content is fum
[4:52:55] Youredoneson666: FFXIV just double downed with their latest update and revamped old dungos. super cool to see 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[4:53:00] swordart2022: @jarilrpg what a terrible take,why raid just sit in city get gear lol

[4:53:24] Ortinoth: pvp conversion?
[4:53:29] jarilrpg: @fairplay2021 more time actually progressing?
[4:53:34] Kakotan2143: @fairplay2021  I appreciate the devs working hard on it but it looks like they tried to hard to make sure it wasnt like the other card games out there, they could have just put Legends into ESO
[4:53:48] Metket: voice lines in tazavesh is pretty cool tbh
[4:53:52] Orirholim: @warrenny group finder would just lower your level down to the old dungeon/raid like ffxiv does, etc

[4:55:10] miIkm4n: Anyone know the timer addon on the right?
[4:55:28] jarilrpg: @fairplay2021 yes, but they could make it so that you need to kill the last boss on a specific difficulty to be able to get the mats to craft the gear
[4:55:30] kaze171: @Towelliee how long to get caught up with leggo if you coming back from 915
[4:55:38] Kisswani: @Orirholim if they ever implement scaling , I have they scale the content up to our level instead of brining us down . Bringing me down to the level of the dungeon and losing my abilities is one of my most hated things in FFXIV tbh
[4:55:45] Kisswani: I hope *
[4:55:50] Gingerprimer: @kaze171 not long at all
[4:55:50] swordart2022: @jarilrpg nonsense LUL
[4:55:56] Shalamyne: gotta go fast

[4:56:09] Vexxsis: @Kisswani thats also changing fyi in the future
[4:56:12] Orirholim: @Kisswani yeah, could go either way, but scaling up sounds better
[4:56:18] Adeppttt: I sure hope they find a good way to put this game on xbox gamepass, so that it can get some kind of BOOM of new players @Towelliee
[4:56:24] Coriollis: time to rebuff guardian Kappa
[4:56:32] Thoreya: music pog
[4:56:37] Orirholim: FFXIV should copy WoW's low GCD and ditch the combo system, it's the only reason I don't play it
[4:56:37] ThePawPaw: FOR AZEROTH
[4:56:44] Kisswani: @Vexxsis that would be cool . in WoW hype mode so didn't check any 6.1 stuff yet :)
[4:57:00] Vexxsis: @Orirholim nah keep the combo system
[4:57:05] Gingerprimer: @Coriollis yes

[4:58:21] Vexxsis: i want this expansion to be good ,id love to come back to wow for a bit
[4:58:41] Thoreya: outlaw kyrian is stupid fun in pvp
[4:58:49] Thoreya: they gotta uncap that spec in pve
[4:58:52] Vexxsis: @Kisswani yeah it sucks but everything else is great , i love the player plates and hope they add it into all content
[4:59:26] Thoreya: LUL LUL
[4:59:27] Metket: @Towelliee what do you think about 1 zone hub like oribos vs boralus&zandalar which one do you think they are gonna do? (both your wish and truth please) Kappa
[5:00:16] Kisswani: @Metket I'm always for more variety . I love alliance and horde seperate storylines because I get to experience different stuff while leveling different alts

[5:01:18] Morpserie: porn hub? Kappa
[5:01:18] zigzugg: The new hub is gonna be Stonard

[5:02:14] ShadoodHD: "ask the guard" "what guard?'
[5:02:20] Kisswani: Demon hunters felt like cheating in Zuldazar
[5:02:27] amricatt: Really screwed Horde with Zuldazar.  So dumb.
[5:02:31] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well it was designed as a battle between factions so 2 hubs had to be done, but Dazar Alor was awful Kappa
[5:02:36] lithium364: i hope they use an remix of the classic wow theme for the 10.0 cinematic feelsgoodman
[5:02:38] warrenny: Or flat map with everything relevant in one room?
[5:03:18] stabzmcgeee: i would like to see stormwind/org used as the main hub
[5:03:24] vDrYuukey: thats what she said

[5:06:20] Kisswani: especially with Khadgar making an appearance in SL
[5:06:24] love_eggplant: can we have a circular hub?
[5:06:26] Ortinoth: but the eternal war is oveer for now so 1 hub most likely is forth coming
[5:06:29] thatguynamedjans: All my homies love dalaran
[5:06:31] Alcanore: I got bored of dalaran i wotlk... please dont bring it back
[5:06:33] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Well Khadgar is back, it has to be Dalaran
[5:06:36] cptrogers123: Boralus were dogshit haha
[5:06:39] wisperuna: @Towelliee Well for legion dalaran was ok.  I am kinda sad they did not use Shattrah as the main city in WOD
[5:06:42] Bernardo994: please repurpose Shatt
[5:06:43] Lamyth: silvermoon as horde hub
[5:06:44] Coriollis: I looked on the bingo card and there was no new BG there Sadge
[5:06:49] Metket: new weak aura for circle hub to hang around and race Kappa
[5:06:54] PToastman: he showed up and waved
[5:06:55] cahoots82: @Fille1809 Boralus is the best hub ever.
[5:06:57] Rudric_Ice: WoW devs needs to cater to the Casuals more than their hardcore players
[5:07:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: We need new BG's, really
[5:07:07] Korupcija_: khadagar end boss of 10.0 🙏
[5:07:07] Scoodles91: make orgrimar great again :D

[5:07:32] aikopooh: lol
[5:07:33] darssia_: what do you think prepatch content will look like?
[5:07:34] lithium364: which doesnt make sense since the portal closed after the jailer cinematic?

[5:07:36] pootsmcgee508: peepoHappy tiny malfurion
[5:07:39] QuigsTV: KEKW

[5:07:41] mavericks312: simpfurion
[5:07:43] xhaven: Id stay and explore shadowlands too, enough with Azaroth
[5:07:47] Coriollis: I think Malfurion went back to the dream since tyrande went apesht
[5:07:48] dreadvaine: isnt Anduin also there in the Maw with Silvarnas?
[5:07:51] SoloImperius: man everytime i come to watch towelliee hes got this wow OST on and it makes me so nostalgic
[5:07:52] comp1: that poor simp
[5:07:52] Orirholim: If the lordareon sutff, etc leak is correct, Dalran makes sense as hub though since dragon isles are above eastern kingdoms supposedly no?
[5:07:52] Dyasis: What if Khadgar is actually Medivh lol
[5:07:56] Nowaayjose: Khadgar did what i did and quit in release and came back 9.2
[5:08:05] agentblaster123: Furion was always one of the favorites. They should use him more in the lore. Not only when Illidan is back
[5:08:07] jeflag: malfurion is stealthing in cat form beside tyrande 24/7
[5:08:09] Coriollis: he was like nah dawg going back to the Dream
[5:08:11] Vexxsis: I'd love more screen time for Valeera ffs
[5:08:11] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee Ohhhh hes back, that was also pre-Legion, he was there for Draenor and for Legion, he has to be here now, or Magni LOL
[5:08:13] raldrik: at some point Khadgar is bringing someone back from shadowlands to help fight murozond
[5:08:16] Kisswani: @Nowaayjose just ptr and datamining stuff . not in game yet
[5:08:16] PToastman: tyrande hang around for like centuries while malfurian was in the dream with his druid buddies. ther are both kind of ew
[5:08:18] Rudric_Ice: what if khadgar is a Dreadlord
[5:08:27] PvtHudson093: if the dragon isles are floating, Dalaran does make sense
[5:08:43] Jokervenom1978: I want to see malfurion kill more dudes with Entangling Roots.
[5:09:17] George2001k: @towelliee I don’t think we will see Khadgar next expansion. He will come with Illidan.

[5:18:51] blade_killa: @SphinxyOCE yea true
[5:18:54] ShadoodHD: NEW THOR TRAILER towPog
[5:18:58] rsimpson105: @Towelliee remember when Bolvar was kind of menacing especially in Legion? and there were hints he was up to something naughty? and then they just threw all that away OMEGALUL
[5:19:00] Manyfist: @vexxsis They died with start the New Trilogy
[5:19:08] Rudric_Ice: can anyone link the thor trailer cant find on YT
[5:19:08] Vexxsis: Gorr the god butcher is gonna be badass
[5:19:09] OlStubbs: I came back before the buffed the rate of progenitor essentia so I was able to farm enough gold from those to get 60$ in battle.net currency and a few months of game time. I am hoping things look good for the next expac
[5:19:17] Bl4ckSauce: @mrfuzzynuts420 yeah I agree
[5:19:20] Vexxsis: @Manyfist sure bruhh
[5:19:43] Squats3: =(
[5:19:43] Betrys: they finally released a trailer for thor!!!!
[5:19:43] 3663Sharad: Warrior Sadge
[5:19:51] temp3st98: Yikes forever
[5:19:52] Frank4LuLz: fuck woyers
[5:19:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Any tank can do all the content, it's just easier with some specs like paladin
[5:20:06] TY_Dunston: all prot warriors are legends
[5:20:09] throwawaym3: When do you think the next xpac will drop?
[5:20:10] Frank4LuLz: aall about pallies and Dk's
[5:20:13] SpoofAvatar: new class that can dps, tank or heal that wears mail armor
[5:20:17] Graybush18: I just got WoW again. I'm so lost lol
[5:20:18] Panasonic82: You can close those rifts from your mount if you are in the air.. without getting off the mount
[5:20:23] net_mi: No wonder why azmon is so pissed
[5:20:35] vDrYuukey: they dont like the magic damage
[5:20:35] Mourningztar: Warrior in my guild is outdoing our DK lol
[5:20:35] hotchrisbfries: I got KSM this season my prot warrior :(
[5:20:36] mavericks312: why tank on a warrior when you can mash stuff in fury
[5:20:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: Warrior is harder to play like Blood DK, but there are some dudes who rock it
[5:20:52] Coriollis: can't complain about tanks, my venge was a happy one
[5:20:56] nephttv_: My warrior has 4p and is 274. My dh is 264 and 0p, It feels easier to tank a 21 on my dh than warrior
[5:21:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: if they make a new class that can tank im sure it will be overpowered for a tier or two
[5:21:00] Vexxsis: star lord and thor together is gonna be sick
[5:21:03] Bl4ckSauce: @gdmonger is that a thing or just speculations
[5:21:03] kappaday23: Kappa
[5:21:20] CGd0c: DK > Pala > DH > Monk > Bear > War
[5:21:25] blade_killa: pee time
[5:21:26] blade_killa: yes
[5:21:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I always say bear tank is easiest and best for new players
[5:21:35] aikopooh: guess warr got shafted in tank department
[5:21:36] merzicdh: honestly feel like DH isn't nearly as good as others. same monk over dh
[5:21:42] Nowaayjose: whens reset?
[5:21:43] rsimpson105: btw whoever was asking for the thor trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZCBEw6GeYE
[5:21:57] GrimhaZZ: new thor teaser was funny af
[5:22:03] Vexxsis: shes ripped af
[5:22:09] Malnar1123: DH survivability with 4-piece and Darkglare is pretty nuts...but the damage isnt as good as brew
[5:22:12] Coriollis: I mean DH is still great for m+ and all overall best tank of the xpack , can't complain :)
[5:22:16] TLew02: that BrM 4 pc is ridiculous. Ive thought about switching from WW to BrM because of it lol
[5:22:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vengeance DH has a ton of mobility, it's more about kiting at higher levels....takes finesse
[5:22:50] ZealotryTV: a tank that has to avoid taking damage KEKW
[5:23:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, for a long time that was the strat in Shadowlands....tank without getting hit much lol
[5:23:26] MrFuzzynuts420: it's sad my bear tank is doo doo now Sadge
[5:24:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH was able to jump in, drop that sigil that nukes, then haul ass
[5:25:06] zeljakis: make wow great again!
[5:25:12] ZealotryTV: thats not a tank thats just an aggro holder
[5:25:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: But yeah they buffed all the tanks over the expansion to make them tougher, and now with class sets they are even stronger
[5:26:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Losing the Heart of Azeroth they lowered the threat multiplier, but tank damage is back up good now

[5:32:52] gooni_coyg: U mean buy to win ark? @teflonmango
[5:33:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Sure, any kind of hype will bring some players back to the game and a new expansion is a lot to look forward to
[5:33:27] Rastailian: not sure what I am more excited about: the NFL draft or the Expac Announcement
[5:33:39] jarilrpg: @bypized new players because of an announcement? the expansion isnt being released for probably another year
[5:34:24] Creative_Pigeon: "we" you got a plaguerock lol
[5:34:25] MrFuzzynuts420: @bypized maybe? i don't see it bringing a ton of people back with the fact is still over a year out from release minimum
[5:34:28] bypized: There are still people that will buy the expac because their streamer is buying it. Some people are just kinda like that. Dumb imo but ya know
[5:34:38] Khade_Tyrson: @Towelliee you think you will do community keys with horde and alli when that goes live?
[5:35:51] Korupcija_: why would he let filthy alliance in his groups SMOrc
[5:35:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: The devs were saying before that they can't make huge changes in the middle of an expansion, so that means 10.0 is their big chance to remake the game
[5:36:01] Rudric_Ice: next patch Towellie's cow surrounded by humans and dranei's
[5:36:18] reformedalex12345: i just got my legendary for completing the sepulcher questline is there any way i can upgrade it to higher IL or change the effect ? 󠀀 󠀀

[5:36:29] aumixp: @rudric_ice and gnomes
[5:36:36] wEiRdO_dUdE: Changing things like how PvP gearing works, that's why we need 10.0
[5:36:37] bypized: @Towelliee do you see blizzard working more to update this engine for 10.0?
[5:37:00] TheLoho: @12345Alex12345 effect will always be the convenant legendary effect. So if you change cov it will change to that, but otherwise no, you cannot change the effect to any old Lego effect.
[5:37:02] mavericks312: @bypized no why would they? the engie is fine
[5:37:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: @12345Alex12345 Once you unlock the unity item from the rep vendor you can create that legendary on any slot at an ilvl
[5:37:38] reformedalex12345: alright ty
[5:37:38] TheLoho: @12345Alex12345 for higher iLvl, you need to get to Revered with the Enlightened and you can buy the memory for the 2nd Lego, which allows you to craft it onto a 291 piece anywhere. The effect is again still only the cov lego
[5:38:23] wEiRdO_dUdE: The quest belt can't be upgraded but you can make a new one that is higher level, basically
[5:38:28] bypized: Id be concerned LUL
[5:38:35] DarkenedHour97: i feel like 10.0 is gunna be bfa all over again or next legion
[5:38:49] bypized: Dragonlands
[5:39:07] onous_: @darkenedhour97 then don't over hype it.
[5:39:33] mavericks312: BFA wwas a good xpac
[5:39:50] Toradin: 20 k dps wtf
[5:40:07] MrFuzzynuts420: i'd love to go back to 2020 8.3 BFA. it was great
[5:40:10] trustthejust1: TRUE
[5:40:14] Rudric_Ice: @mavericks312 it was fun in the last patch thats for sure
[5:40:20] onous_: Every xpac was good its just some of the systems were cringe.
[5:40:22] hotchrisbfries: warriior has challenging shout as well
[5:40:32] trustthejust1: super good for pantheon
[5:40:32] Evcon_: was it great or was corruption just op?
[5:40:32] AlphasaurusRexx: not sure how you can come to that conclusion when nothing has been said about the xpac yet..
[5:40:50] Gillrad: love brewmaster taunting the spiteful adds, they still fixate and just move faster lol
[5:40:51] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[5:40:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think a lot of us loved Legion, seeing another one of those wouldn't be bad
[5:41:22] onous_: Wo for the hoe
[5:41:47] Rudric_Ice: i would like BFA classic with corruptions on the first patch LUL
[5:41:48] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[5:42:18] bypized: i think a lot of "love" of what a "good" expac was is too much linked to nostalgia and that time of your life. And sometimes life as an adult can suck more than back then when things were more simple as a teenager/young adult
[5:42:34] onous_: I'd like to see classic tw tbh and maybe throw some m+ on the og dungeons to.
[5:42:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Legion had a lot of time for development and a lot of content, we wouldn't be able to get that much, but we can still get really cool things
[5:42:42] Shrenko: Legion was recieved poorly for a long time though
[5:42:57] Bl4ckSauce: How are they gonna announce the new expansion , with a livestream or something?
[5:43:00] Shrenko: like the last patch fixed Legion, like last patch in every other expansion
[5:43:29] ItsEddieAU: lai lai
[5:43:33] SoloImperius: bro, just imagine if the start of 10.0 is as good as the end of legion
[5:43:33] bypized: Yep
[5:43:41] reformedalex12345: nighthold was rly good imo 󠀀 󠀀
[5:43:42] Gillrad: legion on launch was so bad it was the only time I quit the game
[5:43:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: Suramar was fantastic
[5:43:47] bypized: brace for impact
[5:43:47] balancedlight: @Towelliee do you ever struggle with what character to play in wow? If so. what do you usually do to help you decide?
[5:43:57] Coriollis: yes at concordance patch things changed for good
[5:44:15] wEiRdO_dUdE: I hated that rep grind, but there was so much cool stuff
[5:44:24] Tokies: that class questing was interesting from the start though
[5:44:26] Tokies: it slapped
[5:44:38] bypized: I struggle to play with DH, I just want my character to fit the fantasy narrative and sometimes DH just feels out of it
[5:44:45] trustthejust1: the key is playing a bunch of characters
[5:44:51] trustthejust1: then you never get bored
[5:44:53] Cristiex2012: Hey @Towelliee ! Did you create the bingo card yet? If so, where can i see it?
[5:44:55] SoloImperius: honestly i wish i could love and enjoy playing 1 game as much as you do
[5:45:04] SoloImperius: i feel like i get bored quickly after a few months with everygame i play
[5:45:05] onous_: What!? Dh's are great.
[5:45:12] cptrogers123: @Towelliee how long have you streamed on twitch now?
[5:45:15] mrniceguy817: Legion was last time profession were enjoyable their own quest were fun
[5:45:43] fluh_: bdk looks fun as hell right now but its sad cuz you need old warrior soul and jailer wep to make them feel that good playing them
[5:45:46] onous_: Dh spirit bomb is op.
[5:45:55] fluh_: and 4pc
[5:46:21] Luxembourger: There is a bingo on Reddit
[5:46:35] Rudric_Ice: hope they bring back archealogy as a profession it would be the perfect  for the next expac
[5:46:55] bypized: WoWHead is broken
[5:47:48] Luxembourger: I returned to WoW for 9.2 and I am really enjoying it. Also the current event with Legion dungeond is really well designed
[5:47:55] AlphasaurusRexx: they could if arch had more collectables. E'chero or whatver ghost moose is cool af

[5:49:27] Molvonos: That's kinda why I blow up the first purp slime and banish the second.  There's some janky shit  that goes on
[5:49:32] swervo61: Withering slime puts an AoE jump on a target so both slime jumped to you
[5:49:51] MrFuzzynuts420: yeah wowhead is messed up
[5:49:57] turbodog14: you were out of range of the boss; so he was chain casting Burning Strain; that's what wiped you.
[5:50:01] onous_: my group normally  banish the first and kills the second
[5:50:07] Molvonos: MDI strats
[5:52:41] ianek: its a wipe.. you cant banish besides the explosive
[5:52:45] kaihole: well they banished it near the explosion lol
[5:52:47] atastybigmac: You're kinda dicking your group by running to the explosive
[5:52:49] sinlesssinner: b oss is free casting
[5:52:58] atastybigmac: if you taunt the ooze out, then banish it
[5:53:01] sinlesssinner: you gotta be in melee range of the boss
[5:53:07] cahoots82: way easier to just kill the ooze
[5:53:27] kaihole: You guys have the damage to kill it anyways
[5:53:36] im_capy: Moral victory
[5:53:44] agentblaster123: Tow are you gonna stream the reveal tomorrow ?

[6:34:16] annokev: @Towelliee Worst fear for the new Expac?
[6:34:19] DragonofWolves: thor teaser released this morning
[6:34:34] LekeroleN: Sweet child o mine Kappa
[6:34:35] Xugodx2012: i understand the spine comment though
[6:34:42] Aquadriel: @Towelliee dragon soul was only hated cause of the LFR haters lol
[6:34:44] Ezekyler: it was awful
[6:34:45] Xugodx2012: the airship was pretty pog
[6:34:46] devilhawk83: At least Docks isn't a bad dungeon, but Grimrail was just terrible
[6:34:52] Legomaniac1m: Hows the Pally in the new patch?
[6:35:08] smashwow: LFR launch didn't help either
[6:35:08] Kisswani: Yeah I like the slime boss
[6:35:10] DragonofWolves: LekeroleN one of the few songs I know. I don't know that many songs from them
[6:35:13] just_laxus: do you think they could do mythic plus of classic dungeons ?
[6:35:34] Ryathael: Dragon Soul was really spoiled by the last 2 fights being letdowns, imo.
[6:35:48] devilhawk83: Dount it @reallaxus
[6:35:49] silverplay1304: @aquadriel I farmed ds heroic on 6 chars, 400 runs, never bored
[6:36:03] devilhawk83: Doubt*
[6:36:22] GamerKillance: Spine of Deathwing def wasn't a bad fight. It was epic and very hatd. The VERY last fight of Dragon Soul was a huge letdown

[6:36:42] Ryathael: I mean, COULD they make M+ versions of classic dungeons? Yes. Would they invest the time? No @reallaxus

[6:37:03] janaparks: is new expac for sure dragon themed?
[6:37:11] silverplay1304: hagara was harder than deathwing LUL
[6:37:20] mavericks312: @janaparks nah kobold themed
[6:37:21] GamerKillance: M+ and them trying to turn WoW into a esport over it causes issues. I'd say it dragged down expansions post Legion due to it

[7:40:52] Poopdollar: trueeee
[7:40:55] pavepawns: i want them to continue covenants

[7:40:59] janaparks: go go green dragonflight
[7:41:00] duffluv22: Pyromancer is the only  valid leaker....lol
[7:41:03] mavericks312: the WoW community is a bunch of idiots
[7:41:03] pavepawns: and keep improving them
[7:41:03] NOS_4EVR: keep the vault, that is a good system
[7:41:08] NOS_4EVR: but needs some adjusting
[7:41:08] Moobot: towHAMUP TOWELLIEE GOT A NEW ORIGIN GAMING PC! | https://bit.ly/35GOQIN towSO |Specs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/414625240233148419/857136797167779860/orringpc.png | Towelliee Gaming is proud to be sponsored by ORIGIN PC!

[7:41:09] Todmeister9000: but that's not continuin
[7:41:09] Hyelander_: Borrowed power system should go
[7:41:12] BlackCl0ud: it's the same with Assassin's Creed franchise. people complain it's the same, Ubisoft changes it and everyone bitches
[7:41:19] mavericks312: hell yea give us covs 2.0
[7:41:23] valianya: Keep it but make it better
[7:41:35] maalow: if we can change freely it's totally fine
[7:41:41] Vendralos: But they're restarting the system so that we have to do it all over again. I think that's what people don't like.
[7:41:42] c0mmander_starscream: that dude sounds like that  old school BC player when BC ended
[7:41:48] MILESkg21: ASPECT Halls 4Head
[7:41:52] Todmeister9000: then it's copying, not continuing
[7:41:52] starknadooo: Its just renaming essentially.
[7:41:53] TheBroCrow: perma pick is fine, but don't tie player power to it
[7:41:59] starknadooo: Which I'm fine with
[7:42:01] racketpunch: big part of the issue is it takes blizz the entire expansion to cater it to the players.  and they do that on purpose
[7:42:11] Rayzor_G: separating content into different factions sucks, you should be able to see everything with your main, not have to create multiple alts to see the whole thing
[7:42:11] Snabido: Watch the MDI trailer Pog
[7:42:15] serbiandruglordx: what if blizzard have been playing us and the next xpac has nothing to do with dragon aspecs but something nobody expects
[7:42:19] Erielle04: Or don't tie them to player power
[7:42:19] Coriollis: marketing people Sadge
[7:42:28] josephrt10: @towelliee get rdy to say bb to covenant skill
[7:42:31] xhaven: COD: Infinite Warfare (the sci-fi) one showd me that people on internet really do not know what they want and companies should ignore them tbh FeelsBadMan
[7:42:33] c0mmander_starscream: TWITCH or BUST
[7:42:35] jeffnsteff2019: what is towel most excited for in 10.0
[7:42:36] duffluv22: If legos are in new expansion make them valid. example the torghast lego is useless in torghast
[7:42:44] pavepawns: @Topersan its continuing the system that its built upon its not copying. as a continuation is meant for continuing the work they have already done and improve even further
[7:43:01] MoonwalkingAngel79: continuiinh to be improved
[7:43:02] Colt_Engineer: how is it considered copying if the company who made it is just continuing it?
[7:43:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || NEW CHALLENGE ANNOUNCEMENT - 9 to 5 Challenge youtu.be/mj5WI5NEHkY
[7:43:05] dinomiyte: jesus, why tha fuck do people argue about dumb shit lol
[7:43:11] rolando415: @Towelliee heyo!
[7:43:12] pavepawns: copying would be just a repeat of awful covenant system till a 10.2 then fix it
[7:43:16] Snabido: I dont want to collect shadowlands anima in 10.0
[7:43:24] zynki: pls no
[7:43:27] cappei: Bet you a major story element of Dragonflight will be Nozdormu turning into Murozond
[7:43:29] Vendralos: People don't want to have to do it all over again, that's the issue.
[7:43:35] faulen: aspect artifact! 󠀀
[7:43:36] KragnosWoW: what would the names of each zone be called on the dragon isles
[7:43:36] slackeryaker: I hope the tier sets don't look trash
[7:43:37] mavericks312: @Snabido you would collect aspect power
[7:43:38] HaloS23: TBH I dont like the mission tables
[7:43:42] Erielle04: @dinomiyte WoW community in a nutshell
[7:43:44] DieselTypeS: @Towelliee  what do you know about Wrath changes!? I seen a video of you saying on steroids!?
[7:43:45] Theduskflyer: towellie gonna be farming Sha 2.0
[7:43:49] Snabido: @mavericks312 Now that i can get behind 😏
[7:43:49] Exxcar: I just either want no player power, or freely switch from the start
[7:43:50] notadoctear: They would refer to their individual order halls as "dragon aeries"
[7:43:57] Vendralos: Agreed
[7:44:04] deadalon: Some dont even think at all :D
[7:44:09] Molvonos: People trying to be cute with wordplay need to get a damn dictionary.  It's obviously continuing a mechanic appropriate for the expac.
[7:44:14] c0mmander_starscream: Fuck it just have them bring back "Draenor" shit just so I can read the forums and eat popcorn slootSmug
[7:44:21] Poriand: housing and solo Q for rated bgs plz
[7:44:24] dimofodi: I don't want to level again but I know people out there love that part.
[7:44:24] Colt_Engineer: I want my artifact back
[7:44:25] EmperorFredd: With all the cross faction changes coming, I would like them remove the cross faction language filter, what do you think?
[7:44:27] KragnosWoW: i wont YEP
[7:44:28] raldrik: I liked being able to grind my kneck and cloak in BFA
[7:44:30] MILESkg21: just call it AP (Aspect Power)
[7:44:32] Exoduc: The only thing i wanted from shadowlands was my damn kyrian wings Sadge
[7:44:37] Fugazi811: Aspect Power spoiler alert!
[7:44:46] rolando415: hey whatever they are going to do just keep the Tier
[7:44:47] Ezekyler: farming AP is good if it is account wide
[7:44:52] jeffnsteff2019: that amount of anima and stygia rewarded was horrid in beginning of 9.0
[7:44:56] picaantee: Titanforging?
[7:44:59] imasofty: @Towelliee ill collect AP but i onl want to do it on one character thinking about doing on a second makes me not want to play
[7:45:00] PvtHudson093: gimmie those short boss kill world quests back
[7:45:03] dimofodi: I'd be ok with covenants again if they tied it to a system that let you change it with a tome instead of needing a rested area and a forge etc.
[7:45:03] DrkPhoenix6913: Dragon power, so we can get a little DP in here (out with AP)
[7:45:06] Vendralos: If AP farms were account wide, I'd be all for them
[7:45:07] ashwing_: bring back islands LUL
[7:45:13] KatieGaming: LUL
[7:45:18] rolando415: LOL true
[7:45:21] idenkaz_: it sucked for 11 months lets be real
[7:45:21] Tokies: people spend months trying to get perfect speed sets out of BFA. Plus, millions of gold.
[7:45:21] MILESkg21: a little OP KEKW
[7:45:23] Coriollis: everyone would've picked convoke Kappa
[7:45:33] mavericks312: let me keep my mirrors of torment lol
[7:45:36] KragnosWoW: i didnt like any of it
[7:45:37] raldrik: I want ashen then TD everyone in my ashen
[7:45:38] Todmeister9000: why not something new and unique instead of a reskin of covenants?
[7:45:40] gregl__: cov system rn is fine
[7:45:42] ConstructedX: people will find a problem in anything now a days
[7:45:46] KingSlayerYotam: WQ are fun, but i only liked legion wq, fast and easy, wasnt a chore
[7:45:47] Adeppttt: @Towelliee i loved that some azerite powers came as actual talents
[7:45:49] Molvonos: Pally convoke would break the servers with all the damn shields
[7:45:52] Megadisaster24: Class Halls was the greatest addition to a wow Expansion, I really wish they kept them going
[7:45:56] Ezekyler: i'm a Convoke andy FeelsBadMan
[7:45:56] Herzenliegen: I was hoping they were going to wipe it and start somewere new.
[7:46:01] Erielle04: @gregltv Yeah
[7:46:04] Vendralos: @Topersan Sometimes new isn't always better
[7:46:05] Exxcar: That's the key, as it is NOW
[7:46:12] dimofodi: He wouldn't mind a second expansion with a system improved upon instead of a fresh one to fix. @Towelliee
[7:46:12] Poopdollar: Warlock convoke slanging out 30 chaos bolts please and thank you
[7:46:20] bladetricks: nobody gives a fuck what the 5% think
[7:46:27] Todmeister9000: @Vendralos and sometimes it is
[7:46:29] BfAleTitan: i think that is the key take away, covenant system is great, as it is now, don't unlearn
[7:46:30] rolando415: just gunna have to wait until tomorrow and they will throw some shit we are like "wtf"
[7:46:32] duffluv22: Get rid of cookie cutter talents
[7:46:33] BlackCl0ud: what's the addon for the map to show all the spawns and stuff to do?
[7:46:38] KatieGaming: i just want a house, is  that too much to ask for? LUL
[7:46:38] TheManlyWay: the problem with the dragonflights is that ppl will swarm to their favorite dragon even if it doesn't benefit them
[7:46:39] xSoldierhardx: A torghast system next expax i want
[7:46:48] Vendralos: @Topersan Funny how them trying to reinvent the wheel is what ruined the game
[7:46:49] pavepawns: @Topersan why something new instead that can easily flop over a system they atleast made work (9.2 but still needs improvement). asking for something new just increases the changes of them fckin things up and making people suffer
[7:46:50] atowellthatiallreadyused: i want CONVENANT DRAGONFLIGHT And AP power back
[7:46:53] mavericks312: or they go back to rep grinds and give each flight its own rep and ppl would hate that to
[7:47:14] PhillyDilly18: Do you think 9.2.5 will reduce the amount of Anima you need for transmog stuff from the covenants?
[7:47:18] rolando415: come on @Towelliee you need the help
[7:47:19] rolando415: on this
[7:47:26] deadalon: They should just add these aspects powers as catchup mechanics tbh....
[7:47:27] valianya: @towelliee would you want to see Scenarios return as a way to give more lore and content outside raids/m+ and maybe to show past key story details from the novels
[7:47:30] MeisterPetze: i want that fuckin worldquest with the stupid turtles back
[7:47:31] havenbirch: I want artifact weapons
[7:47:32] TheManlyWay: Alexstrasza's covenant would be full just because she's the more well known dragonflight
[7:47:33] rolando415: lol
[7:47:40] mavericks312: @PhillyDilly18 no you get so much anima now you cant even use it
[7:47:52] Truthseeker96: balance all specs for pve and make the needed nerfs for pvp
[7:48:03] theDirtyon3: i have toons gettings runes for me
[7:48:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Want to go black dragonflight, but forced to go blue because it does 2% more damage.  > <
[7:48:04] cahoots82: Get that rep, get the reusable one for like 40k gold
[7:48:05] PrisheBurningBlade: i think it works if you keep the soul shape, fleshcraft, kyrian pot etc part.  But with likely new systems I think it becomes imposible to balance especially if there is new class
[7:48:05] theDirtyon3: its great
[7:48:07] rolando415: I want I want I want
[7:48:08] Shrenko: you been slacking!
[7:48:31] xSoldierhardx: @towelliee whAts ur thoughts on a torghast thingnext xpac
[7:48:36] rolando415: mam! bathroom!
[7:48:42] KatieGaming: Amen
[7:48:57] MILESkg21: 🙏 YES SIR
[7:48:58] mizerboy: Great...they are bringing back TF/WF then. That makes me happy :)
[7:49:06] Tokies: agreed.
[7:49:07] lukeymoo: less timegates and id be happy
[7:49:08] Exxcar: Make a good game and stop trying to FORCE us to play it. Trust me, give us an alt friendly FUN game, and we will THROW our time at you Blizzard, full stop
[7:49:13] Taz_85: More account wide currencies, and alt accessibility 100 %. I'd be pretty happy
[7:49:23] MILESkg21: everything ACCOUNT WIDE
[7:49:24] Vendralos: World of Warcraft: Account Wide
[7:49:27] KragnosWoW: i feel like wow will never be alt friendly, its been out for 20 years
[7:49:29] mrpresbaby: CLIP IT!
[7:49:30] BlackCl0ud: what's the addon to show spawns and stuff on the map?
[7:49:31] Nightshaft25: PREACH
[7:49:33] Raggamoffyn: we will build a wall and make the jailer pay for it
[7:49:34] AureliusXV: rep
[7:49:37] deadalon: I think they should just forcus on making alt play better.  Allow the causal players to play 1 character properly.
[7:49:40] Theduskflyer: oh we going dragon mounts!!?!!? TOWELLIEE KNOWS!!!! hes giving you the answers guyslol
[7:49:42] Herzenliegen: Yes please
[7:49:43] ilavayoutv: World of Warcraft: Player Friendly
[7:49:45] rolando415: Make Love Not Warcraft next xp
[7:49:46] hnti86: World of Altcraft Kappa
[7:49:46] Poriand: i would be surpised if we get a new class
[7:49:48] pavepawns: we dont care about the top raiders aswell. make sure that if you try to limit them dont limit the other 99%
[7:49:49] Tokies: I don't care about time gating because I work. Just as long as there's alt catchup I don't mind time gating
[7:49:50] AureliusXV: rep is the bigest one for me
[7:49:51] Nightshaft25: AMENO Kreygasm
[7:49:56] Xindii: more time-gated systems KEKWDISCO
[7:49:56] Vendralos: 10 characters
[7:49:57] Collected1: agreed. shared progression across alts would be huge.
[7:49:59] xXSiebzehnXx: The ability for everyone to use axes KAPPA
[7:49:59] duffluv22: yup!!!!
[7:49:59] lukeymoo: i started playing wow a month after 9.2 and this rep grind for unity is slow
[7:50:02] Truthseeker96: huge facts tho
[7:50:04] Collected1: let me play any alt and progress.
[7:50:06] AureliusXV: i dont wnat to grind rep for 2 or 3 toons
[7:50:09] Tokies: Not the new mount creation system. That mote thing suxed
[7:50:12] KragnosWoW: preachin to the choir man
[7:50:15] Samaellus: there is no peeps left to do that @Towelliee
[7:50:21] rolando415: very true
[7:50:24] Collected1: if they do that, i'm back
[7:50:26] Tokies: motes should have been buyable. l
[7:50:28] BlackCl0ud: and play for longer
[7:50:30] Bloodseeker1604: yes
[7:50:31] thatguynamedjans: I would become so addicted to wow again if they did 2 things, 1.) Focus on making every class FUN to play and 2.) make Alts as accessible as possible
[7:50:33] Exxcar: @Towelliee that's what I never understood... we don't need systems that "force" us to play with timegating.... people played DAYS in like WOLK because we just enjoyed the game and it was alt friendly
[7:50:34] cappei: I refuse to play alts when I have to grind the same dogshit systems over and over. When I play an alt, all I want to do is raids, PvP, dungeons, and gearing them. None of the other bullshit I've already done on main
[7:50:37] Mech876: Can we join the TBC/Classic/WotLK with the retail communities in the Blizzverse?
[7:50:38] DragonofWolves: Acually gold being account wide, would be pretty damn awesome
[7:50:38] zgag: Blizzard will never do that.  It's not the Blizzard way
[7:50:39] MILESkg21: i'll buy a lifetime sub if that happens
[7:50:40] Exxcar: Blizzard just seems to forget that
[7:50:42] Demanisraar: so true
[7:50:44] JWoody82: someone threw out the idea of one reward for hitting max level on the first character being a boost to max lvl on another - seems good
[7:50:49] xXSiebzehnXx: 💯
[7:50:51] mrpresbaby: let us buy motes with that stupid currency for gear lol
[7:50:53] KragnosWoW: 4Head
[7:50:55] Collected1: 110%
[7:50:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Roster level, shared power increase with alts, would also be good
[7:50:59] papascruge: unpopular opinion, bring back real dailies with daily hubs again
[7:51:00] BlackCl0ud: imagine they make a huge revamp of the game
[7:51:02] duffluv22: never understood time gating???!!!!
[7:51:04] jeffnsteff2019: transmog or aka armor sets better be better designed in 10.0
[7:51:11] Collected1: i've always wanted an account wide "paragon" level system that you can work towards on any alt
[7:51:14] Theduskflyer: What baout a Player Bank. simular to like a guild vault, but for your alts. keep mats and gear and what not in one place boa stuff. boe, etc
[7:51:17] Todmeister9000: COPIUM
[7:51:25] MILESkg21: and please not another "We're lisstening" bullshit
[7:51:26] KragnosWoW: HOPIUM
[7:51:28] cappei: Don't worry, it'll all come together in 10.3 when they don't listen to feedback again LUL
[7:51:30] Vendralos: Imagine having more content
[7:51:31] kaihole: They kinda got it right by making the set pieces accessible outside of the Raid and making Unity power account-wide
[7:51:35] viralpirate: Good point
[7:51:39] zgag: If the beta is a marketing tool more than a feedback/testing than we know how Blizzard will proceed.
[7:51:40] Yagr6: level once in the new expansion and unlock 100% bonus xp for alts
[7:51:50] rolando415: big boi
[7:51:51] jeffnsteff2019: like cata with its 3 added dungeons in cavern of time
[7:51:53] bypized: @Towelliee do you think Blizzard/Microsoft will try to revive HOTS?
[7:51:57] aumixp: @duffluv22 if timegated wouldnt exist people would do everything in a day and whine about nothing to do
[7:51:58] Truthseeker96: @Collected1 If they can somehow capture the diablo grind and how easy it was to gear another class plus play then i guarantee EVERYONE would come running back
[7:52:02] BlackCl0ud: !addons

[7:52:11] Collected1: ok now i'm getting  seriously hyped

[7:52:42] tarantinosfoot: tarantinosfoot subscribed with Prime. 
[7:52:43] KragnosWoW: The first month of shadowlands was the best part of shadowlands
[7:52:54] rolando415: DUDE RIGHT!
[7:52:56] PrisheBurningBlade: I think you nailed it tho "Accessibility" that was the problem with Leggo in Legion,  Azerite / Corruption in BFA, and Covenants / soublinds in SL.   They need to do it from the start, and all of those xpac are great thruout not just final raid patch
[7:53:02] rolando415: I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
[7:53:03] MILESkg21: Kreygasm

[7:53:21] Snabido: Like any other account catch up gear they've given out
[7:53:28] maalow: couldn't have said it otherwise
[7:53:30] AtticussDk: the ZA/ZG dungeons they did in cata were awesome. catch up gear just before the nest raid tier. i think Cata had an awesome dungeon system
[7:53:30] Demanisraar: yep , idgaf about my alts anymore
[7:53:32] KragnosWoW: stop youre getting chats hopes up way too high KEKW everyone is saying AMEN now
[7:53:33] rolando415: @BierArnO sadge
[7:53:34] bypized: I have a normal job, I dont have time to do a whole new alt
[7:53:40] Vendralos: Make it easy to hit 250+
[7:53:43] Collected1: if they get to a point where you can log into any alt and never feel behind then that's huge
[7:53:50] Nokterian: I am never stuck on one healer
[7:53:53] Nokterian: i play all healers
[7:53:56] DrNox__: AMEN PridePog
[7:54:08] rolando415: Iam all healers!
[7:54:10] Erielle04: The wow team has taken out the trash, which will bring a change in philosophy as a result
[7:54:10] Oculusdeath: @AtticussDk i agree with you 100%
[7:54:11] bypized: @Towelliee do you think Blizzard/Microsoft will try to revive HOTS?

[7:54:29] Kelmor: And they hurt mount collecting behind raid this patch
[7:54:52] rolando415: lmao
[7:54:55] pacificmc1: @Towelliee There's a leaked picture of the cinematic
[7:55:04] aumixp: @kelmor as it has been all xpacs
[7:55:12] Shrenko: I just play on 1 character, collecting achievements and mount on my main only
[7:55:14] thatguynamedjans: Are the +20 portals to dungeons account wide? cause they 100% should be if not
[7:55:15] Kelmor: no
[7:55:16] DragonofWolves: pacificmc1 already saw it
[7:55:17] DrNox__: AMEN that would be perfect and then i would play the shit out of this alt!"
[7:55:21] valianya: They also didn't have the collection systems in place fully 10-15 years ago

[7:55:44] mmrghost7: dasdsada
[7:55:44] viralpirate: b
[7:55:46] duffluv22: People would try more classes.
[7:55:49] Aggravius: #accessibility
[7:55:51] Fugazi811: the rep for enlightened on alts is dumb
[7:55:53] Theduskflyer: how about honored on an alt to unlock it all from your main whos completed it?
[7:55:59] dinomiyte: you need accessibility!!!!
[7:56:04] rbayduden: we did it!... Now we just need blizz to say it
[7:56:04] metavahn231: no thats too casual, only hardcores alowed
[7:56:06] rolando415: "trust"
[7:56:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Drag the boomer game into the zoomer era, kicking and screaming. LUL
[7:56:13] PrisheBurningBlade: Ion tmrw "You think you want accessibility but you dont"
[7:56:14] Perseus_IRL: @Towelliee What do you think of the new defense hires for the Colts?
[7:56:16] garkhyt: Indeed
[7:56:22] mmrghost7: ofc
[7:56:27] Demanisraar: I would play the shit out of my hunter alt if that where the case yeah
[7:56:31] 91Niki: Yeeep
[7:56:31] mmrghost7: i will play double time
[7:56:40] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee yeah, Blizz needs to stop thinking they are still in 2004
[7:56:40] deadalon: I like how Lost  Ark is doing it.  What I don't like is that Lost Ark is doing in giving ppl same multiple same class adds benefits over a fresh class alts
[7:56:44] duffluv22: It just that bare accessibility...that simple bare accessibility
[7:56:45] Shearkahn: reputation should have been account wide a long time ago.
[7:56:47] jeffnsteff2019: what ya all think convoker or dark ranger for ne class in 10.0
[7:56:56] rolando415: o is this the start of the 24hr?
[7:56:57] Hitokiri83: agree alot of work no reward atm
[7:57:03] thatguynamedjans: I have this perpetual cycle where I finish everything I need to do on my main, log onto an alt for 10 minutes and then exit the game lol
[7:57:14] im_n0t_jezus: i have 1.5 k relic
[7:57:14] MILESkg21: just imagine how much more active user time they would see
[7:57:17] richardmu: @ongtehjem
[7:57:18] garkhyt: Grind on Main is fine but to do the same on Alt in unfair
[7:57:19] im_n0t_jezus: no clue what to do with them
[7:57:22] skorchhx: yeah getting ready to do the 9.2 story for the third time for an alt...
[7:57:25] Atokiri: the last time i did a big grind for alts, was legion legendaries and just for the mage tower that was all
[7:57:25] assman_ny: I started hoarding them too actually
[7:57:25] KragnosWoW: new raid requirements for pug "must have 6 alts with aotc to get invited on main"
[7:57:25] Snabido: Accountwide, but only ones obtained after the hotfix 😏
[7:57:26] rolando415: nice
[7:57:27] richardmu: this is the locaition of sandworm relic
[7:57:39] SensationalBanana: Grateful Offerings, man... They have to remove those as a currency. I'd play the SHIT out of 60 content if I didn't have to farm those on EVERY character.
[7:57:39] Demanisraar: @datguynamedjans same, I only do mission board gold stuff on them LUL
[7:57:40] EmperorFredd: SWTOR has the legacy system, that makes alts so much more enjoyable
[7:57:47] rbayduden: 979
[7:57:48] zeitgeiz: I don’t think they will make those account bound. They should
[7:57:50] Zivs: it says in the tooltip

[7:58:49] Exoduc: That makes too much sense
[7:58:49] Vendralos: Do the Gw2 approach and make all currency account wide
[7:58:50] natevic: account bank
[7:58:51] zgag: That would be to good. Blizzard doesn't care about fun stuff
[7:58:56] thatguynamedjans: Uncap valor + account wide

[7:59:03] Collected1: sign me up
[7:59:07] MILESkg21: ACCOUNT BAGS
[7:59:09] mmrghost7: blizz fears that will make ppl to play less , thats where they are mistaken
[7:59:10] Meistarinn96: account wide currency would be so fucking good
[7:59:13] assman_ny: Access a damn ruby all of it, could not agree more.  Tired of different currency just sitting there dusty

[8:00:02] 3dRes: Take care, Towelliee duckCringe
[8:00:04] Collected1: perhaps thats why cross faction is becoming a thing to allow true account wide integration
[8:00:05] xXSiebzehnXx: Have a great day man! Good luck with whatever it is
[8:00:09] richardmu: @Towelliee then the issue would be: will the currency gained from the alt also added in this pool? or capped from main ?
[8:00:13] pereadin: Sounds good, I'll set my alarm
