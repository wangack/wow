[3:11:55] Clicklesly: This is the internet, everything can have drama ^^
[3:12:35] zgag: You can read about it on the POE reddit forums.  Asmon even admitted to the allegations.   It was GGG giving steamers priority queue when the game was having major DC issues all night
[3:12:36] CritcobainTV: This is the worst run ever lmao

[3:13:46] zgag: There were lots of videos and Asmon even admitted to knowing about it
[3:14:05] thecynicalshuffler: it was drama bcz no one could stay connect for more than 5 min and then you would get dumped into a queue og over 100k and streamers that had sponsored streams got to get straight back in
[3:14:10] zgag: It was mentioned that GGG actually messaged the streamers directly on how to bypass the Queue
