[1:08:41] LFMwowgirls: its honestly kinda hard to look for specific contractors besides the normal renovation ppl
[1:08:46] Vigi9413: @Towelliee and chat, my dog stole my spot while I was at work LUL https://imgur.com/a/Tcd67cg
[1:08:48] Wulfgrym: what about contractors who have done media spaces for actors or people who work in those industries
[1:08:50] zorantt: @Towelliee I can do your set up for 5 million gold in game Kappa
[1:08:50] FatR0B0T: What about production set designs?
[1:08:51] Brandonhipster: Im sure there some in Texas LUL
[1:08:51] Kriven: Just reach out to the people that did Nick Mercs room lol that shit was crazy.
[1:08:56] CDubTheRIPper: maybe the person youre looking for is just hidden LUL
[1:09:03] TMMOOF: streaming specific going to be tough, but dedicated gaming room maybe
[1:09:13] Sollice: @Kriven Yeah but he is in Michigan right?

[1:09:22] MOLAR305: I would say find an AV company they might know good contractors
[1:09:33] nasteemurph: Nick is in MI
[1:09:43] KneoTank: nick is in florida
[1:09:54] DaltonIRL: @NeoSkyGaming yeah FL now but his decked out house is in Michigan.

[1:10:02] nasteemurph: Main house is in MI, Winter home in FL
[1:10:21] Phantomstrk: Nicks room is in MI. But he‚Äôs currently in Florida but that‚Äôs not where his room is. I think this company came in from outside MI but not sure

[1:44:20] jerexify: @Towelliee Have they said how far they're going to go with it? Will they just keep re-releasing all the expansions?
[1:44:23] supermintyfresh: sunwell!!

[1:45:04] kozamasu: idk why we let companies get away w charging massively on phones
[1:45:14] xRoughneck: I'm kinda guessing BC and WotLK won't hold up the the expectations tho, since it was way better in memories, but yet those areas are the least popular for leaving / timewalking afaik.
[1:45:26] supermintyfresh: as long as it runs in 120 dpos at 4k on my phone ill be happy

[2:45:11] ronnyone: before mythic dungeons how did people gear outside of raiding
[2:45:20] psycothedruid: raiding kekW
[2:45:20] smashwow: DH is alos insanely tanky if you go the fiery brand build. and still pumps numbers
[2:46:02] cerality: the fear broke :D
[2:46:10] Dave_e: explosives monkaW
[2:46:26] daniel85mg: explosions monkaS
[2:46:40] smashwow: LOL they killed everythign else first
[2:46:51] Frank4LuLz: so squishy
[2:47:02] Armdel: hp drops below 50% everybody panic
[2:47:09] crimestream: this instance is the ultimate test of herd mentality
[2:47:13] RowRicaso: what key lvl?
[2:47:20] Dave_e: oops
[2:47:25] theDirtyon3: KEKW
[2:47:31] Supertek: 15
[2:47:44] no_case: Best cov for balance druid?
[2:47:53] Wildside1177: yes
[2:47:54] DargieK: just do it
[2:47:57] smashwow: yup
[2:47:59] casualboomer: lol just try it
[2:48:02] Iolgz: @no_case nf
[2:48:03] YungshrimpXD: i've done it
[2:48:44] invictusseu: nf for raid m+ kyrian @no_case
[2:48:54] Dave_e: the maze is easy if each member goes and reveals a symbole
[2:49:03] NotAnotherNettie: not only that - but my eye/brain coord is better when i can see them all at the same time lol
[2:49:13] Dave_e: but yeah running between them is a nightmare
[2:49:18] GiraffeHydra_: @Dave_e good man, too many groups dont do that
[2:49:23] swampt1l: And still easiest dungeon
[2:49:37] smashwow: kyrian is only good. if you have people in your group pulling over a dps threshold. NF is just better all around because you don't have to manage a damn thing.
[2:49:55] JacobBose: lol no one is streaming this morning except you
[2:50:52] Lulaboo: Good morning
[2:50:59] Dave_e: yeah dps peeling off a mob before its dead TRIGGERS me also :)
[2:51:05] venomizedcarnage: Good Morning LuLa
[2:51:06] TexValhalla: LULA! POGGERS
[2:51:07] casualboomer: If I'm the tank, and I'm the only one interrupting anything, that triggers the fuck out of me
[2:51:12] Cru3: @lulaboo
[2:51:13] Dave_e: especially in Halls of Atonement and they leave the mobs alive at 5% hp so the boss just sucks them to full hp
[2:51:20] Machine42593: not interupting TRIGGERS me soo bad
[2:51:23] Cru3: @lulaboo HeyGuys
[2:51:28] Machine42593: like why would you not help the GROUP out
[2:51:30] crimestream: the dps mindset is "i'm going to "waste" a cast on this low mob, i need to move to next so i can start my rotation and PUMP"
[2:51:31] venomizedcarnage: Congrats guys on the closing of the house
[2:51:35] smashwow: or did you all die? just let a bro know
[2:51:47] casualboomer: In a 14 or 15, it should be standard
[2:52:01] casualboomer: I shouldn't get to the end of a Mists, have 47 interrupts, and the rest of the group has 7 each
[2:52:02] UltiCarnagee: In Pugs either no one interrupts or everyone kicks the first cast
[2:52:02] ThatGuyFayde: interupts are basic
[2:52:03] GiraffeHydra_: @Towelliee my friends did that all the time in BC, finally had to scold them "No, only tank can switch to build aggro, you bitches finish shit or I'm bubbling next boss"
[2:52:05] Dave_e: I mean honestly if people dont interrupt in a 15 they shouldnt be doing a 15
[2:52:09] GoGetItKo: no that's wrong. People just don't know TO interrupt
[2:52:14] TexValhalla: I'm that guy that as soon as he sees something to interrupt I hit the button KEKW
[2:52:22] CritcobainTV: Same ^
[2:52:24] skaaldi: and then it's like everyone uses their interrupt on the same mob or literally no one does
[2:52:28] smashwow: interrupt is a basic toolkit of your player. if you overlap, that's fine. just use the damn kick
[2:52:34] JacobBose: Hey what addon are you using for those health bars i like dat compared to neatplates
[2:52:38] Machine42593: blows my mind not even on the GCD lol and ppl dont do it
[2:52:41] Dave_e: yeah i interrupt quickly in pugs because i know i can usually beat the others and it shows my intentions quickly
[2:52:43] stickylicious21: @GrittyTexan same KEKW been trying to get used to wait to see if tank interupts the first one tho
[2:52:44] tommyhales: they should make it so u can only cast a interrupt if the mob is casting something that can be interrupted that way if someone gets it u don't waste yours
[2:52:51] CritcobainTV: not really fine to overlap in higher keys @smashwow gotta have shit kicked
[2:53:10] MemphisIX11: only talking that goes on really is in de other side for portals lol
[2:53:13] silentkenny093: yeah, a lot of people faceroll the earlier difficulties and never learn to interupt, as a healer, doing necrotic wake on high keys is a nightmare in pugs because nobody interupts necrotic bolt
[2:53:19] UltiCarnagee: Well in higher keys you are probably spending 2 mins planning that stuff out when tank does the Route
[2:53:22] TexValhalla: well in m+ I always let the tank interrupt first because I haven't met one yet that doesn't, then after that i smash my button LUL
[2:53:25] casualboomer: Timing this one is going to be tight
[2:53:30] mo197: maybe start that conversation
[2:53:37] YungshrimpXD: not if they don't wipe
[2:53:44] smashwow: @critcobain yes but at least show that you know you have the kick. baby steps. sorry should have put more context to it. just show you know you have the kick ability. we can work on overlaps.
[2:53:46] Fabsst: what plater profile is that?
[2:53:56] CoffeeNeko_972: happy to see shaman doing good dps
[2:53:56] swampt1l: They got 7 minutes lol they are fine if no wipes @casualboomer
[2:54:01] metavahn231: remmeber in WoD when they said no one wanted dungeons so they only added 5 LUL
[2:54:02] D3m0nHunt3r666: I just blame everyone for explosives, then you take the whole blame for it , no ty xd
[2:54:13] mysteriousm4n: lmao
[2:54:26] itsTwigs_: Good morning @Towelliee and chat. Cold as northrend in florida :(
[2:54:30] mysteriousm4n: the reflex tank interrupt LUL
[2:54:31] casualboomer: @SwapT1_ yeah, I'm retarded. i'm used to fail pugs
[2:55:03] TexValhalla: @Lulaboo You find them kettle cooked Takis yet?

[2:56:29] dbeezie14: fuck SD
[2:56:29] TexValhalla: WOW POKEMON POGGERS
[2:56:37] cowthulhu1: I would tank that key.
[2:56:41] itsTwigs_: @Towelliee grats on the house. Did you just like... pay it off ha
[2:56:43] TheCliffyShow: My decay grub is cuter. Despite the awful name.
[2:57:00] yokai_5: sanguine depth >>> necrotic wake
[2:57:08] brokenhelix85: The dps was actually solid I have not had a solid 14 or over key this week for dps at all
[2:57:11] Frank4LuLz: you stole it
[2:57:11] Wrizzik: Gratz to you @Towelliee enjoy making it yours!
[2:57:17] Dave_e: necrotic wake is easyyyy, people just dont know how to play that second boss
[2:57:19] mo197: payment go down?
[2:57:30] Rev_4_Life: @Towelliee did it start as a rent to own?
[2:57:33] Dave_e: all the dps need to do on NW 2nd is kick the casters and let the come to tank
[2:57:36] TheRealGecika: Congrats!
[2:57:52] Wrizzik: Towelliee tryna be JP LUL
[2:57:57] Jarlan23: did you watch wandavision yet
[2:58:02] KillaPr0: damn that was fast
[2:58:04] Gizadragon: congratz
[2:58:15] Dave_e: there's only 2 casters though, if you kick the first they are silenced for like 5 sec
[2:58:15] itsagentscully: @Dave_e its the overlap with the breaths that makes it difficult.
[2:58:19] Duelzyy: just switched to night fae on my rogue and it‚Äôs literally amazing
[2:58:29] itsTwigs_: I'm still angry.. bought my house Feb with a 3% and then covid hit and everyone is getting like... a 1.5%
[2:58:35] mo197: your mortgage payment cheaper than the rent?
[2:58:36] Dave_e: @itsagentscully yeah but ideally tank should be interrupting boss, dps just kick the mages and then run to tank
[2:58:44] Affiiance: 2 Monks can just Paralyze the Mages and ignore them
[2:58:52] Dave_e: lol that sounds like a nightmare LUL
[2:59:03] Affiiance: Dont even have to kill them
[2:59:07] D3m0nHunt3r666: do does classes even interrupt? lol
[2:59:11] dbeezie14: fuck thats a good idea actually to bring an unholy and call it a day
[2:59:38] Kerminal: whats abomb?
[2:59:40] itsagentscully: yeah as a hunter i just trap the furthest one each time, and on stitchwerks before 3rd boss take my pet out to taunt for mutilates
[2:59:44] Dave_e: a-bomb?
[2:59:49] JacobBose: i play frost with necro its fun
[2:59:51] swampt1l: Slappy hands
[2:59:51] JeanRalphio_: what is a bomb?
[2:59:51] Yngvezs: Abomb is slappy hands
[2:59:54] Dave_e: ah ok
[2:59:56] Jarlan23: slappy hands. abomination limb

[3:00:43] Wrizzik: My three most watched were EJ_SA (space streamer), CrevLM (FF14), and @Towelliee
[3:00:49] swampt1l: I did layer 3 TC in a grp & the tank did 275k dps
[3:00:55] Supertek: houses here are like 2 million dollars
[3:01:05] Big_Bob91: @Towelliee I refinanced back in September near SF / Bay Area and got 2.625%
[3:01:16] TheRealGecika: niiice
[3:01:24] CDubTheRIPper: i might give group a try for fun, ive been doing solo this whole time lol
[3:01:36] Wrizzik: @Jimmyraww if you do the math, you can still refinance even now. You just have to figure out when the closing costs will be covered by the interest savings.
[3:01:47] stickylicious21: venthyr is also pretty good for dps dks
[3:01:47] swampt1l: Next patch new 8 layers no rewards Kappa @towelliee
[3:01:53] Jarlan23: i think max unholy is venthyr
[3:01:56] JacobBose: I played Venth up until yesterday it was ok
[3:01:58] dbeezie14: dks going anything but necro as dk is trolling
[3:02:02] Eelz255: @Towelliee under 3% is good for a 30 year conventional, you can get closer to 2% if you do FHA. Grats on closing on the home.
[3:02:03] Frank4LuLz: ill flip
[3:02:04] xideontv: NF needs to be nerfed, so many classes there
[3:02:04] Yngvezs: venthyr is really nice for dk aswell
[3:02:05] draconisraccoonis: my blood dk is night fae
[3:02:08] Sepulchair: I won't play Night Fae no matter what
[3:02:11] Affiiance: If they change any of the "best Covenants" not the best ppl gonna lose their mind
[3:02:15] thiccsushi: 9.1 is where they will make us all change our covenants from what we currently have thats my guess
[3:02:19] Frank4LuLz: ill flip out and drive down to Irvine
[3:02:21] Wrizzik: @Jimmyraww we had a sub-4% mortgage and refinanced about 4 mos ago to like 2.825%
[3:02:28] Lockrocker: I wouldnt change as an UH DK regardless.. i pick my covenants for asthetics... fuck min max
[3:02:29] JacobBose: Frost Dk needs love for sure. Its my main class
[3:02:32] Jarlan23: max from limit was playing his unholy last night and it was venthyr
[3:02:37] swampt1l: Aff,Balance,fire,MM all night fae LUL
[3:02:38] Wrizzik: (but we also dropped term)
[3:02:53] itsTwigs_: @Wrizzik "Pain"
[3:03:11] Rev_4_Life: venthyr blood is nuts and i will never change it.
[3:03:15] JacobBose: Venthyr for dk is boring and doesnt ad a hole lot
[3:03:21] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee they probably won't change anything while AWC is going on for the next month
[3:03:25] casualboomer: Imagine if they buffed the fuck out of havoc lol
[3:03:36] gorilla_quantistico: where i leave a 2k square feet flat is 1.5 mil dollars btw
[3:03:37] Br1anRay: id be pissed

[3:03:42] Veras_7: yea but i also dont care about world first
[3:03:48] Veras_7: i just want a class to not suck
[3:03:49] ythril: mythic is over. blizzards needs to start balancing already asap.
[3:03:50] lumaday: Yeah they kind of have to lay in the bed they made
[3:04:02] NotAnotherNettie: i hadn't thought of that - how much impact balancing would have had in the context of a world of rare loot
[3:04:21] swampt1l: Havoc LUL
[3:04:23] Wrizzik: @Jimmyraww the most painful part for me was unfreezing my credit long enough for the refi to check it. But then again we went through Rocket Mortgage
[3:04:50] Raffah_: Towelliee are you going to play New World?
[3:05:02] gorilla_quantistico: i think april
[3:05:09] WoW_StandalonE: May
[3:05:10] Devlinate: its coming early feb
[3:05:20] itsTwigs_: @Wrizzik Not worth it to refi where Im at (Destin, FL) sellers market. also money down is not a W
[3:05:25] slatester: with boe's and splits, top guilds can get any class geared quickly
[3:05:29] Rev_4_Life: just buff other tanks damage and make higher keys less of a kite fest.
[3:05:36] Raffah_: yeah they changed/added a lot of new stuff
[3:05:38] PhillyDilly18: Would they release 9.1 around a possible TBC Classic? I'm sorry if that is a silly question, I know very little about their dev teams.
[3:05:40] swampt1l: Where do you think the new raid is gonna take place? @towelliee
[3:05:58] BemisA52: new world was a lot of fun at first but idk, kinda fell off for me.
[3:06:13] ythril: but the problem is they need to balance.- not because of some content patch, but so warriors, assa rogues and other shit classes get a spot and MM Boomies etc arent the only one getting picked in random groups
[3:06:14] daniel85mg: new world has a release date alread? hmmm
[3:06:15] thiccsushi: new world releases when our new tier starts roughly i think
[3:06:16] Jarlan23: im hoping we get a kyrian raid like a forsaken one
[3:06:23] problembarn89: Hi Towelliee. Which legendary would you recommend when running prot paladin in mythic pluss? Currently got a 190 Relentless inquisitor.
[3:06:43] Br1anRay: man i fr just got 9 ads back to back :(

[3:43:32] hideonreddit: @Towelliee eh it should be fine now that they transitioned to wfh. The transition itself is time consuming, productivity is actually the same if not more from home.
[3:43:33] tommyhales: dude renown on alts is nothing

[5:18:54] coloombiano: Kill boss first so you don't have to kill pride at 100%
[5:19:00] Cosmolus: Like you don't want it to drop 5 pieces of loot per run make it 4
[5:19:13] Cosmolus: just don't completely gut it like it is now
[5:19:32] board4life65: i miss my bonus roll each week
[5:19:44] Cosmolus: Like in the last 5 keys i did i got anima
[5:19:50] herblex: mashed16Pog
[5:19:55] ToastLamoan: Shadowlands has fallen flat for me. Gear not rewarding and most of the systems you can bypass if you want. Too much focus on pvp gear. Choregast is boring but required for soul ash
[5:20:32] smashwow: 210 loot Kappa
[5:20:40] nihilistic_bat: the same amount anima you get from doing a +2 as well
[5:20:54] MrGattz: come play the new poe league. theres loot everywhere!
[5:21:14] anithics: i feel you @FallenSun210 i had typed in chat earlier "is anyone else getting dry on shadowlands or is that just me" and seems to be that is a pretty big chunk of people
[5:21:22] Cosmolus: the most outrageous thing is that we are doing mythic content and we are getting gear with less ilevel than Heroic. Its a fucking complete joke
[5:21:30] nihilistic_bat: so much loot you have to use a filter :)
[5:21:52] MrGattz: true
[5:21:54] Throdio: 35 anima isn't just unrewarding, it feels more like a spit in the face
[5:21:59] MrGattz: otherwise your game crashes
[5:22:15] ToastLamoan: Yea, I can go in and do 4 x 10 M+ and get a chance at two 220 ilvl pieces. I can completely skip heroic raid if I wanted. Splash in a bit of pvp if I wanted and gg
[5:22:19] Cosmolus: @Throdio spit in the face ? it feels like i have been punched in the dick
[5:22:26] Zarinna2015: @enryu_mazino can you explain what you mean. I just started again a couple days ago.
[5:22:46] MrGattz: you mean you dont enjoy running a +15 and only getting 35 anima?
[5:22:47] Stiffy84: Stiffy1984 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 112 months! Congrats on the house! Hammers UP!
[5:22:47] LunarVaporz: !Kays mounts
[5:22:50] nihilistic_bat: +1 zekeYAY
[5:22:56] Zarinna2015: Mythic vs heroic
[5:23:12] DarthLemon: i'm new to wow with shadowlands. do blizz have a history of ignoring feedback or do they listen?
[5:23:12] SofaHigh: do you ever sit back and think "man I've been playing and streaming this game for a lonng time" nothing wrong with that btw
[5:23:22] Cosmolus: @Zarinna2015 You are going to do mythic+ keys (10 or above ) and u get 210 ilevel gear. heroic level gear is 213.... AND this is thinking you will get gear when it's not 35 anima
[5:23:30] xddDupers: hey towelliee why'd you go venthyr as your covenant instead of kryian? Im trying to learn prot pally more
[5:23:31] nihilistic_bat: LUL

[5:33:11] Darthyrevan: Mass Effect <3
[5:33:15] ArcaneMaki: DOA
[5:33:23] Dsolzz: KEKW
[5:33:27] armeleth: fell fuckin flat
[5:33:32] swordwindgaming: you enjoyed the game's best content
[5:33:49] ManneehFresh: Games as a Service. I will never buy does games. no content
[5:33:54] Jarlan23: its kinda depressing. they keep updating the game for their 200 person playerbase
[5:33:58] Jarlan23: i feel bad for the devs
[5:34:07] zulway_: badges
[5:34:09] ToastLamoan: tokens
[5:34:11] MrGattz: badges
[5:34:11] Frustrated_Nerd: A token system
[5:34:15] MrGattz: or tokens
[5:34:17] armeleth: @Jarlan23 isn't that square enix too? wtf are they doin
[5:34:18] JLmorten: Nerf pvp gear. lol
[5:34:19] Urebaldd: Returnal looks nuts just watched the trailer
[5:34:23] thiccsushi: @Towelliee Badges and upgrade the same way pvp is right now for M+
[5:34:24] Sincline387: Name a time in wow when quest rewards that were epic were boa
[5:34:25] Uther_The_Lightbringer: buff ret probably
[5:34:30] ExtreemeCheese: I saw some interview quote the other day from their game director and he made it seem like something was coming
[5:34:31] RobNXS: Bring back a token type system similar to honor / conquest
[5:34:36] ArcaneMaki: Weekly cap valor points.
[5:34:36] Jarlan23: well you can update the covenant gear to 200 right now. they could raise that
[5:34:37] ExtreemeCheese: maybe a valor quartermaster?
[5:34:40] Cru3: PvE currency
[5:34:40] MrGattz: pve NEEDS to have a token vender.
[5:34:45] MistaHat: i mean just offer a currency at the end of each run you can turn in to a vendor and use that same currency to grow the ilvl
[5:34:47] wolfieke: just go back to the old system where pvp gear only works in pvp environement
[5:34:55] necralia: just add a fcking badge vendor
[5:35:00] Frank4LuLz: add sockets and forge it
[5:35:00] SavageCheez: Allow more gear to drop
[5:35:04] Urebaldd: There needs to be a token vendor, I'm still using 190 weapons because I get 0 drops for 2h
[5:35:05] subluxt7: @wolfieke so make gearing worse? LOL
[5:35:08] UHStorm: unfix the bug they said they had with too many drops happening in raiding they said they had
[5:35:11] smashwow: put valor gear back in the game. gg
[5:35:18] RazzeronTV: What nicoline level you got in that vape bro?
[5:35:20] WymGaming: token or currency vendor
[5:35:23] Archiee: Gearing alts is hell right now
[5:35:25] Cosmolus: What we need is not to get a 35 anima every fucking key
[5:35:29] CazualD: Mythic keystone tokens
[5:35:31] Atem___: gets peopel to pvp again though
[5:35:38] Atem___: which is a change
[5:35:39] Jarlan23: people sleep on the covnant gear you can upgrade i dont get it.
[5:35:45] armeleth: Or add some kinda totem system that after so many runs you can cash it in for a piece of gear
[5:35:46] nihilistic_bat: I normally play 2 toons but only 1 right now due to gearing
[5:35:50] loragheta: VALOR POINTS
[5:35:54] Uther_The_Lightbringer: its sad that m+ doesnt drop even heroic gear and with pvp u can get 220
[5:35:56] WymGaming: you dont even get the anima on Heroic boss kills lol
[5:36:00] jakobsurfs: or the vendor could give a random item of the slot of your choice ala timeless isle
[5:36:01] thiccsushi: getting 35 anima is completely useless
[5:36:08] Cosmolus: Make it at every 3 keys you get atleast 1 piece of gear
[5:36:12] MrGattz: yeah but the anima is VERY clearly a gate. you need 5000 just to upgrade 1 thing
[5:36:18] MrGattz: why are we only getting 35
[5:36:24] RobNXS: If they did that the Anima would need a seious drop increase
[5:36:25] Arocian: residum really never helped casuals though
[5:36:30] Cosmolus: Fuck PVP
[5:36:36] JPS15: noone wanted to pvp for essences
[5:36:36] PoopdeckClaxton: Badges?! We do need stinking badges!
[5:36:39] subluxt7: Alot of people dont want to pvp to gear...
[5:36:40] JPS15: and noone wants to pvp now
[5:36:40] ch1rpz: ?
[5:36:43] ArcaneMaki: And players don't pvp for fun, but force them.
[5:36:44] yeti82: but did they not want mythic raiding to be the place to get max gear? so valor will never give max ilvl ?
[5:36:47] Cvixx: I don't like pvp, and I feel like I'm forced to play it now
[5:36:47] ManneehFresh: exactly
[5:36:48] swordwindgaming: Ignoring all the new SL content to do old pvp content with no new SL oriented maps is a fail
[5:36:49] Cosmolus: i should not have to do PVP to get gear fo PVE
[5:36:55] MrGattz: ^
[5:36:55] ch1rpz: Why do people have to talk shit about stuff others like?
[5:36:56] D3V1L_MAN: That's me, I don't want to
[5:37:00] metavahn231: i never asked to be forced to pvp
[5:37:00] thiccsushi: @Arocian At least with residiuum running 1 15 on an alt could get you 2 heroic ilvl pieces from the weekly and 1 normal
[5:37:03] 3dRes: Who PvP's for fun anyway?
[5:37:04] BlackSoulDH: true, it just forces PvP
[5:37:04] ManneehFresh: i would never pvp if it wasnt for the better gear. only reason im pvping now
[5:37:08] ch1rpz: If you dont likew to pvp, just dont do it. Dont talk shit
[5:37:10] CozzyFlannel: PvE players stood up for PVP players. PvP players should do the same
[5:37:15] Bro00: It should be just another OPTION to get some kind of reward.
[5:37:17] Shredmuffn: idk PVP is almost half the game for alot
[5:37:28] ch1rpz: Im a pvp player that hads no hate for pve. Just do you
[5:37:32] nocturnal_2195: @towelliee PC Gamer had and interview with ion and talked about some of this stuff. but idk how to link it
[5:37:37] Lantern214: The most annoying thing for me was last week. I cleared normal and heroic CN... and just received anima. The vast majority of my gear is conquest arena gear, and I despise arena.
[5:37:37] nihilistic_bat: agree, you can pvp if you want to but have the same reward system for pve
[5:37:42] ExtreemeCheese: I saw Ian did a small interview and hinted at something changing
[5:37:42] Cosmolus: @Shredmuffn PVP is half of the game because we have no other choice to get gear
[5:37:48] D3m0nHunt3r666: where are those god damn Q&A from BFA LUL
[5:37:55] JPS15: make vault more generous
[5:37:57] armeleth: Preach has a video on that interview's comments
[5:37:59] larres2g: Sanguine depths, why is it so hard lol
[5:38:03] Atem___: I mean its either increase drop amounts or valor liek you said
[5:38:05] hailstormz: but that would make sense lmaooo
[5:38:07] TrapM3: Im enjoying PvP a lot.
[5:38:07] Shredmuffn: @enryu_mazino no it always has been i stoped doing pve in cataclysm
[5:38:07] Uther_The_Lightbringer: they wont change loot till 9.1 anyways
[5:38:07] blazeofhell: yet, in bfa, you were forced to to pvp if you wanted to be better in pve
[5:38:11] BoldBalls: As a raider i cleared full HC and didn't get single item, not 1 item dropped
[5:38:23] Claba60: as a mythic raider, i am using exactly 1 piece of gear from raid. it's a heroic piece. the rest is vault/pvp
[5:38:23] smashwow: probably raiding then M+
[5:38:30] Bromanchu: Cata had the best gearing system, man. Justice and Valor vendors to match Honor and Conquest. The hour of twilight dungeons to get alts at a base item level to do current content.
[5:38:30] thiccsushi: @BoldBalls last 4 weeks of full clearing heroic ive got 0 pieces
[5:38:31] Cosmolus: @Shredmuffn No it hasn't . I did BFA without doing PVP for example
[5:38:48] SavageCheez: Shit, Preach hardly plays anymore
[5:38:48] Veegore: preach said the same thing, he thinks valor from ion's interview
[5:38:50] Shredmuffn: @enryu_mazino same but i never did pve
[5:38:50] metavahn231: preach is much too salty to pvp
[5:39:03] Sandisy: honestly I think they should lower the scaling in m+ across the board. at the same time add rewards for keys higher than +15. casuals suffering in keys from what I hear
[5:39:03] ManneehFresh: Same i got 1 piece in three weeks of full clears.
[5:39:06] ThePawPaw: how to make ppl do more PVP....just put amazing rewards there EZ
[5:39:22] ch1rpz: The system is off. Why is that on the pvp community?
[5:39:29] Claba60: and that's like so much raid gear lol
[5:39:32] ManneehFresh: I did 10 mythic dungeons and didnt get a single item
[5:39:34] Atem___: still remember the rage when people had to PvP to get the Pandaria Legendary cloak
[5:39:35] MrGattz: @ch1rpz its not. no one is blaming the pvp community.
[5:39:36] Cosmolus: @Shredmuffn So there u have it . I should not have to do PVP to get gear for PVE and you should not have to do PVE to get gear for PVP
[5:39:39] Shredmuffn: @enryu_mazino most pvp'ers just quit in legion and bfa
[5:39:41] MistaHat: @Nomeroh that cant be right, not saying youre lieing but if you are doing full clears, only one piece total, you at least had to have gotten three
[5:39:51] twelvevalve: luckier than me in raid
[5:39:54] Cosmolus: @Shredmuffn then there you have your answer
[5:39:56] Kromede: thx bli$$ard
[5:39:57] ch1rpz: I understand
[5:39:59] Lumimyrsky: Hey @Towelliee ! Have you finished Corridors in Torghast yet?
[5:39:59] KewlKittyProductions: Exactly
[5:40:00] ManneehFresh: I wish
[5:40:06] D3V1L_MAN: preach it!
[5:40:11] MrGattz: me to. im happy for the pvp community, it looks fantastic over there
[5:40:12] Claba60: "i don't wanna do your shit to get my shit" is what pvpers have been saying forever though
[5:40:14] nihilistic_bat: PvP all you want
[5:40:14] armeleth: I just wanna do keys and get loot
[5:40:14] metavahn231: solution is buff M+

[5:40:15] Cosmolus: Exactly. Thank you
[5:40:15] MrGattz: i just want no part of it
[5:40:16] BlackSoulDH: very true
[5:40:17] armeleth: Not fuckin anima
[5:40:21] Odinslayer: wasn't blizzard forcing pvp people to do m+ and pve shit for them to gear up in bfa also?
[5:40:22] ch1rpz: I wish everyone could just do them without having to do shit they dont like
[5:40:28] illi333: Well m+ isn‚Äôt dropping shit
[5:40:29] Shredmuffn: @enryu_mazino yea we need badges and vendors thats what pvp'ers were fighting for b.e we felt forced
[5:40:37] Lumimyrsky: @Claba60 Maybe, but PvP isn't the focus of WoW now is it? :)
[5:40:44] Thoreya: ^neither is m+
[5:40:54] ch1rpz: Is m+ that rough?
[5:41:00] ch1rpz: I dont run it so I have no idea
[5:41:02] swordwindgaming: more like its not rewarding
[5:41:02] anithics: yes
[5:41:03] nihilistic_bat: 35 anima
[5:41:04] Stormrazer78: I dont pvp simpel...so I play less wow so be it!
[5:41:04] Kromede: gold and sucki sucki KappaPride
[5:41:06] anithics: its that rough
[5:41:06] Cosmolus: @Shredmuffn i know and i wanted that for you so bad. But blizzard just went full Pepega and did a reverse on us
[5:41:07] demonictanktv: WHO SELLS IT LOL
[5:41:13] 5ft7ChristmasTree: m+ is more popular than pvp, if you're going by viewership
[5:41:19] MrGattz: @ch1rpz its not that its hard to do its that there is no gear. no gear at all is dropping from pve content and the stuff that does we dont need
[5:41:19] Claba60: @Lumimyrsky i mean, that's up to the player. im just saying that we pve people are now having to deal with what pvpers have to deal with now
[5:41:19] Namahc: its a perfect world now
[5:41:19] sussyrev: good luck getting a pvp boost as a tank KEKW
[5:41:24] smashwow: M+ is rough but the gear from M+ makes it not really viable to gear.
[5:41:30] Zarinna2015: Zarinna2015 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:41:35] metavahn231: pvpers never had a problem doing pve though
[5:41:36] Shredmuffn: personal loot is bad imo @enryu_mazino
[5:41:37] MistaHat: @Revanite20 they do it all the time
[5:41:40] sussyrev: less does not mean broken
[5:41:41] ch1rpz: Oh I understand
[5:41:46] ch1rpz: Thats true
[5:41:48] jason_shade: An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind
[5:41:49] ManneehFresh: Us complaining about pve doesnt mean we hate pvp.
[5:41:49] metavahn231: good pvpers have no problem doing mythic raid
[5:41:51] Cosmolus: @Shredmuffn YES idk why it even exists
[5:41:51] TheOGMed: Get vers out of PVE
[5:41:52] Thoreya: blizz barely considers m+ in the same breath as pvp and raid and people cry about m+
[5:41:55] Rastaballin: if you PVE just do mythic rading and your fine :D
[5:41:58] Namahc: ??you don't ''need'' to pvpto be competitive in pve
[5:42:02] TrapM3: Why is PvE broke?
[5:42:07] InvertLook: Sounds a lot like game dev in general, fix one thing and it breaks a bunch of others :p
[5:42:11] Thoreya: people literally have to beg blizz to make m+ as a pillar next to pvp and raid
[5:42:12] D1Chile: @Towelliee the issue is the amount of gear u can get from pvp and how quick
[5:42:15] BigButtus: they should bring pve gear currency.
[5:42:17] robinski112: \
[5:42:21] ch1rpz: Does raid drop a lot of gear?
[5:42:24] Netratrix: agree
[5:42:26] MrGattz: yeah. me. im at 204ilvl and i CANT progress without mythic raiding.
[5:42:27] KewlKittyProductions: yeah they made it really really hard to get a weapon this expansion, almost feels like Vanilla lol
[5:42:31] coloombiano: Why do those same casual players that you're describing need more than 205 though? Shouldn't that be the ceiling for someone who's just doing LFR and m0?
[5:42:35] sussyrev: lol no
[5:42:37] nihilistic_bat: wod NotLikeThis
[5:42:38] taolos: raid and m+ are just way too stingy with loot
[5:42:39] Wildside1177: He sees the WoD Dragon coming for him!
[5:42:42] twelvevalve: casuals shouldnt be the same as someone who puts the time in
[5:42:44] Thoreya: thats a hot take
[5:42:46] holbern5644: Making a alt was super easy to gear in bfa
[5:42:47] Ilibrit: I'd hate to be someone that made decisions for wow tbh
[5:42:51] Thoreya: theyd revert loot changes rn if it was going that bad
[5:42:53] ch1rpz: A
[5:42:54] metavahn231: raid gives the worst gear of all the systems
[5:42:57] Kromede: ion hit 217 https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/malganis/Gurgthock
[5:42:58] pbnj_kills: A lot of people here joining the conversation without knowing the gearing issues
[5:43:04] Wildside1177: Coming to eat his face!
[5:43:04] swampt1l: Pull the rip cord
[5:43:05] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[5:43:11] shale93: Im very happy with the gearing right now, I like to play all aspects of the game
[5:43:12] Cosmolus: All they have to do is make gear drop more. Period
[5:43:16] ch1rpz: R you getting at least a couple pieces of gear from heroic raid?\
[5:43:18] nihilistic_bat: he has full pvp gear Kappa
[5:43:18] sussyrev: less loot=Draenor is mega Pepega
[5:43:20] CazualD: many casuals in my guild already fed up, haven't logged on in 2 weeks lol
[5:43:24] Thoreya: if ion pvps ill gain hella respect for him
[5:43:27] Lumimyrsky: Stat-wise raids actually give some pretty crappy loot for a lot of specs that value crit and vers lol
[5:43:34] 5ft7ChristmasTree: no xmog KEKW
[5:43:42] Kromede: 4/10
[5:43:43] necralia: casual Kappa
[5:43:45] swampt1l: Not 24 LUL
[5:43:45] holbern5644: Lol at the renown
[5:43:49] taolos: renown 19 because he quit already LUL
[5:43:54] nihilistic_bat: no drip KEKW
[5:43:57] Claba60: that bastard. most of his gear is from raid lol
[5:44:01] MrbatataTV: wait does he really play WoW?
[5:44:04] MrbatataTV: pog
[5:44:04] Thoreya: ion dont give a f bout transmog
[5:44:11] Rev_4_Life: even Ion doesnt do sanguine depths LOOOOL
[5:44:13] Kromede: ofc TdN__
[5:44:15] Crowzcut: hes busy lol
[5:44:21] anithics: probably gets funneled gear
[5:44:30] nihilistic_bat: honor level 6 nice
[5:44:31] metavahn231: raid has no chance to keep up with with pvp and M+ even M+ give better vault
[5:44:54] KewlKittyProductions: 90% of guilds won't even see past first boss in Mythic if even the first boss
[5:44:59] Thoreya: seems like its coming from mostly the m+ peeps
[5:45:06] anithics: raid vault is pretty meh unless you have the mythic option
[5:45:21] HeyyyHali: it feels like a math equation where you have to do the same thing to both sides (PvP and PvE) and they just... forgot the PvE side
[5:45:26] Lumimyrsky: Most "mythic" guilds can't even kill HC Sire so they just kill Mythic Shriek and call themselves a mythic guild LUL
[5:45:35] LoseAlotLuke: feel like a chunk of people have left the game already @Towelliee
[5:45:37] Claba60: honestly, i'm fine with the gear drought. it was boring to be heroic raid geared out after 1 week of spamming 10s imo
[5:45:39] FuWeii: ppl can do anything if they make it their job to do so lol
[5:45:41] sussyrev: there is a thing called the weekly vault....
[5:45:43] OVERWATCHMEN: Hey Towellie long time great to see you hope all is well
[5:45:48] piratechris: I'll tell you... go play tetris is what
[5:45:49] metavahn231: not just casuals but midcore players
[5:45:51] Nickydo0: mythic plus
[5:45:53] TrapM3: PLay the game?
[5:46:02] Thoreya: blizz reverts loot in 9.1..then people will complain about the bfa loot pinata again
[5:46:05] D3m0nHunt3r666: m+ without ilvl gl with that :P
[5:46:05] Thoreya: gonna go full circle
[5:46:06] TreMetal: I remember arguing with anti-forging andy's about how removing it screws over casuals (not myself).
[5:46:09] highlydegen: wooly858 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! when do you think the usual new expansion fall off will occur?
[5:46:09] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee We've been forced to do Rated PvP to catch up is what has happened.
[5:46:12] anithics: towelliee just cares about the health of the majority and its amazing
[5:46:21] Nigerianbucket: @Towelliee Just be FFXIV where gear is on a conveyor belt, you plan out your entire gearing process, and pvp is meaningless =P
[5:46:21] 5ft7ChristmasTree: the only way i replaced my 138 green shield was from the campaign quest, and i was running m+ hard :(
[5:46:22] D3m0nHunt3r666: just play with the mission table Kappa
[5:46:23] Lesliech0w: Which problem?
[5:46:23] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[5:46:25] stepdrag: Don't you guys have phones?!?!?!
[5:46:25] MrGattz: you cant play the game more than you already are lol casuals dont have 20 hours a week to mythic raid at 10pm
[5:46:32] Stormrazer78: Play casual...
[5:46:44] xxKrayzie: titenforging POG
[5:46:48] Frank4LuLz: extra rolls for gear
[5:46:56] itsCloaker: im 207 but im 14% in my primary stat and 24% in 3rd best stat
[5:46:56] metavahn231: M+ is where casuals go when their specs are not FOTM enough to be in raid, they need to buff it asap
[5:46:58] GodKingMuninn: Need like 7% more loot overall
[5:47:02] twistedstick1: He is going to fuck up the gear in PvP and have both systems fucked.
[5:47:05] Neowanderer: bring back tokens and have a gear upgrade path
[5:47:07] ManneehFresh: I just dont want to be forced to pvp because of terriblie drops from raid and m+
[5:47:08] Cosmolus: make m+ like it was in bfa
[5:47:10] Lesliech0w: Oh. AP and Conduits aren't very rewarding or compelling forms of loot.
[5:47:12] armeleth: what do you think about the kiting meta for tanks right now?
[5:47:13] swampt1l: We need to pull the rip cord
[5:47:33] Lantern214: They need to scrap lfr at this point and reduce the amount of ilvl gaps we have
[5:47:35] mavericks312: maybe allow the covenant gear to scale up to 207-213 ilvl
[5:47:42] LGilbert1982: My guild is still 5/10 heroic and we're already having to drop ppl because the casual players are having trouble meeting the gear thresh holds. Our off tank had to be sat and is now grinding pvp to try to get his spot back and he NEVER pvps.
[5:47:44] Lesliech0w: They'll bring back some bastardized form of Valor. Again.
[5:47:44] Wildside1177: And whoever thought that a 184 weapon was adequate for finishing the Covenant campaign is a god damn scrooge!
[5:47:51] swordwindgaming: WQ grind is a scam
[5:48:07] wherleybird55: I loved the valor system
[5:48:08] DemonicGrizz: @Towelliee All I know is as a new wow player and this being only me second expansion running Mythic keys for eight hours and maybe getting one drop FeelsBadMan

[5:48:08] 5ft7ChristmasTree: @mavericks312 that would be great
[5:48:11] smashwow: just fix the ilvl drop from M+ and give more gear drops from raiding. then if that's not enough kick in the valor vendors
[5:48:18] Claba60: when they bring back valor, everyone will cry that they don't have enough time to grind the valor points
[5:48:20] metavahn231: how this guild group on premade finder says only they can roll on any boe's that drop
[5:48:21] Kromede: i got the 1 hander token from the campaign quest, needed the 2hander FeelsBadMan
[5:48:26] ManneehFresh: finishing the covenant questline was so unsatifying
[5:48:29] Cosmolus: The person who did the covenant campaign rewards was fucked in the head i swear
[5:48:34] OVERWATCHMEN: I'm so busy haven't even got to start Shadow Land
[5:48:43] Shredmuffn: even their questing gear in the campaign quest is good but it ends
[5:48:48] Finarato: lol put towelliee on the dev team
[5:48:56] pereadin: I'd be down to farm 5k valor just to get 1 piece of 226 gear
[5:48:56] Lesliech0w: LFR weapon for the final reward.. was such crap.
[5:48:57] itsagentscully: 2 vault choices is catch up
[5:49:03] Jarlan23: all that covenant gear you get from the campaign you can upgrade to 200. all they have to do is increase the limit on that
[5:49:03] Crowzcut: me to
[5:49:15] ATV93: i liked night fae
[5:49:16] Wildside1177: Night Fae felt like a cinematic was missing.
[5:49:23] hadusii: Maldraxxus was ok ish
[5:49:24] Neowanderer: bluther ftw
[5:49:32] itsagentscully: yessir
[5:49:33] Gipetto: im really craving some nachos right now
[5:49:35] riviktv: uther is mad hes gonna fight somone lol
[5:49:38] itsagentscully: just has to be from different aspects of the game
[5:49:43] mavericks312: @jarlan23 it Max's 197 currently but they could max it at 207 or 213 livl
[5:49:45] nihilistic_bat: my first vault was the same 2 pieces I upgraded that week, exact pieces
[5:49:46] smashwow: that or break the chests apart.
[5:49:48] MrGattz: that doesnt fix anything. mythic + still feels bad to run
[5:49:49] piratechris: Who do you think get full vaults? Casuals? Man what are you smoking?
[5:49:50] jaysteea: i dont trust uther tbh
[5:49:51] metavahn231: the problem is the content is pointless to do outside of vault choices
[5:49:52] ManneehFresh: vault is not an issue. everythin else is lol
[5:49:54] itsagentscully: @cubertin same here
[5:49:55] KryingMoon: Bluther
[5:49:56] JPS15: you would still pvp for high ilvl gear
[5:49:58] Uutef: if they bring back valor it will be like Nethershard, you target a slot not a specific piece of loot
[5:49:58] Cosmolus: idk about that....It doesn't fix anything
[5:49:58] D1Chile: u can just p[ick 2 pvp piec3es nice
[5:49:58] GegaBites: !armory

[5:50:04] Throdio: Could allow upgrading ilvl of gear via valor again
[5:50:05] itsagentscully: @MrGattz true
[5:50:07] JPS15: then you could upgrade 2 pvp pieces a week
[5:50:28] Odinslayer: aint pvp gear bad for pve though?
[5:50:31] MistaHat: @Towelliee do you mean the valor gear system introduced in WoD?
[5:50:31] Bromanchu: What if your class really likes vers?
[5:50:39] D1Chile: they should just make valor weekly cap like conquest gear
[5:50:52] MrGattz: i would rather pick 1 item in the vault and just have m+ actually drop more than 1 piece of loot thats lower ilvl than the vault.
[5:50:55] CobblyWobbly: CobblyWobbly subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! towPog happy 2 months! towPog
[5:50:59] GegaBites: what addon is he using for mission table?
[5:51:01] Claba60: @D1Chile exactly
[5:51:25] ManneehFresh: you can rotate the same ones to get sa different result
[5:51:31] j_hooligan: you need a tank and healer
[5:51:42] scrotobaggin: Just be night fae Kappa
[5:51:50] scrotobaggin: Easy missions
[5:51:52] D1Chile: @Towelliee towwelie send an email to ian and tell him to just make a valor vendor and make valor weekly cap like conquest and we good
[5:51:55] RagingbullTX: @towelliee I think that there are too many difficulty levels when it comes to PVE that it causes issues when having to limit item level for each one.
[5:51:56] LoveLantern_: What‚Äôs the add on for the mission table??
[5:51:59] Uutef: i wouldnt put meatball on the left, he takes increased damage
[5:52:13] Jastice01: MOUNTS!
[5:52:25] D3m0nHunt3r666: Maldraxxus boys heal a lot artoSmug
[5:52:25] Jarlan23: kyrian has 2 healers and all they do is heal one close ally
[5:52:29] Crowzcut: i was reading stuff on wowhead some players ready unsub becasue they cant kill the layer 8 bosses in twisting corridors
[5:52:31] Xerevil: wait how can ur Meatball hit everything...mine can't
[5:52:38] metavahn231: whats bis mission table cov

[5:54:34] yeti82: hmm rip :/
[5:54:48] Jarlan23: yeah me too. i dont get any xp missions anymore really
[5:54:54] mavericks312: gearing aside this is still blizz's best xpac in 8-10 yrs
[5:54:58] kashmara: Is the Encased Riftwalker Essence worth it from ve'nari?
[5:55:05] coloombiano: Losing level 39 and 51 missions give you 1200xp and 1500xp respectively
[5:55:06] Throdio: The ventyr troops have one use, to even out anima when it ends with a number that bugs you, like a 6
[5:55:12] turfjitsu: lol
[5:55:12] coloombiano: You can just send your minions on suicide missions for free
[5:55:12] Lumimyrsky: Meanwhile Nightfae were "nerfed" but still steamroll through all their missions because it's still broken.
[5:55:21] swordwindgaming: Legion doesn't exist anymore? lol
[5:55:23] Lesliech0w: Sit their in your own wrongness. Jesus.
[5:55:28] TexValhalla: Legion?
[5:55:29] Crowzcut: wrath his the beat
[5:55:31] TexValhalla: the fuck
[5:55:31] piratechris: There have been many expansions I've liked better than Shadowlands
[5:55:33] JPS15: this is blizzards best xpac
[5:55:34] Sincline387: mythic raiders are not happy, but casuals and pvpers are.....I wonder what the bigger group is
[5:55:35] ToastLamoan: @Towelliee what's this mission table addon?
[5:55:38] TexValhalla: Wrath is not the best
[5:55:40] SeckSymbols: Legion started the AP bullshit grind, cant exuse that
[5:55:41] TheObscene: @Towelliee what was ur favourite expac?
[5:55:41] SeckSymbols: excuse
[5:55:42] D3m0nHunt3r666: better than legion? did you stop playing on wod or what tastelessLUL
[5:55:42] chrslp: WoD best Kappa
[5:55:43] Aeylid: !mission
[5:55:43] Moobot: Mission Table addon - https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/venture-plan
[5:55:52] MrGattz: its the best base model xpac.. but content wise it needs work. but its the easiest xpac that they COULD make the best.
[5:55:55] Lesliech0w: Legion was so much better
[5:55:59] Urebaldd: It's a very good expansion, but legion was gooder
[5:55:59] Kerhlen: this expac just feels rushed
[5:56:10] Shwayze24: fax
[5:56:10] Sincline387: was 8.0 better than 9.0
[5:56:17] angmar95: legion had suramar, SL has the maw...
[5:56:18] XuremGaming: Mission tables are terrible
[5:56:18] Sincline387: not 8.3 is better than 9.0
[5:56:19] Aeylid: monkaS no
[5:56:20] TexValhalla: all you Arthas/Lich King lover boys need to get over Wrath tbh
[5:56:20] Hitokiri83: my table dosnt offer xp quests anymore
[5:56:22] kemliii: what addon is that
[5:56:24] Throdio: I send my people on missions I know they will fail for the 1200xp
[5:56:29] SeckSymbols: Its easily better then BFA
[5:56:33] MrbatataTV: Legion was great
[5:56:36] SeckSymbols: No question about it
[5:56:36] chrslp: I feel like all of the games released in 2020 were rushed to cater to the people at home from the pandemic
[5:56:40] Odinslayer: lets wait for 9.0.5 and 9.1 before we judge it
[5:56:44] Xcenntric3k: @Towelliee packers or rams?
[5:56:45] Powerhugful: Is that an addon for the adventure table?
[5:56:57] NotDillyTV: go pack go baby
[5:56:58] MrGattz: !mission
[5:56:58] Moobot: Mission Table addon - https://www.townlong-yak.com/addons/venture-plan
[5:56:59] Jarlan23: fuck the packers
[5:56:59] metavahn231: is Ion high? "we stripped away randomness to give everyone more clear goals"
[5:56:59] Klauzzer: im loving it
[5:57:03] Vigi9413: but it still beats the beginnign of bfa righht?
[5:57:03] Urebaldd: Yeah hopefully content patches make a difference
[5:57:08] Br1guy: what we need is a vendor that sells dungeon loot, where you can buy every dungeon item that you want, for a currency that you farm by running M+ intime. So the more runs you do, the more Items. That would solve alot of problems in my opinion.
[5:57:11] Lesliech0w: Rushed it out to stem the sub loss from BFA. lol.
[5:57:11] Powerhugful: Cheers
[5:57:11] TreMetal: Legion was pretty bad at least until some of the legendary fixes
[5:57:34] GroovyTheSenpai: AGREED
[5:57:38] Lumimyrsky: +1
[5:57:40] MrGattz: yeah
[5:57:42] Jarlan23: i like it. im excited for gear again and that feels good
[5:57:43] BlackMarmalade: Just bring back 3 chests from Legion
[5:57:49] metavahn231: nothing is a clear goal in SL, it has the most rng of any expansion
[5:57:54] Kerhlen: will they be able to release the next content patch on time ?
[5:58:01] metavahn231: except pvp i guess
[5:58:14] TrapM3: The Goals need to stretch towards the end of a patch. not all maxed out halfway through.

[5:58:17] ScytaleTv: Before launch Bellular made comments that if they didn't delay till after the new year the game would have major issues ... he was right
[5:58:47] GroovyTheSenpai: if they would have done it JUST for the world first race....i think that would have been cool but OPEN it up for the rest of the people
[5:58:57] TheRealMFingVigor: Hey, what's going on dude
[5:59:10] ManneehFresh: and then if it not BIS lol
[5:59:28] zeeAbe: You get 2 daily quests and only 1 world quest
[5:59:29] akia03: wq
[5:59:32] ExtreemeCheese: WQs give more rep
[5:59:33] Raffah_: the daily quests are so trash
[5:59:35] zeeAbe: WQ is much faster
[5:59:41] Sollice: @ScytaleTv What major issues? Loot? Thats a design choice. This is how they wanted loot to be distributed. POst New Year launch would not have changed that
[5:59:43] jason_shade: wq is faster but u do get 2 dailies
[5:59:52] akia03: daily takes ages
[5:59:55] Lukenonwalker: dailies give more offerings but take forever
[6:00:07] OVERWATCHMEN: Isn't alpha and beta the reason for trying things out not after release
[6:00:20] Broomba: even towelliee said that way back in late alpha and beta
[6:00:21] RobNXS: Any thoughts of making a DH tank?
