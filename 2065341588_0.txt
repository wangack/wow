[0:30:46] DerPazzel: ai excuses
[0:30:52] Rivalyn: danm
[0:30:57] Ewriick: We thought AI would replace "simple jobs", like stocking, moving things etc omE

[0:31:57] light126: @Nunadaaa Good EZ
[0:31:57] gowahl: 5 people make videos, you now make videos 2 times faster, that doesn't mean you need 2xvideos
[0:32:00] Deliro714: This isn't WOW
[0:32:01] Trexbo_: ICANT Writers literally went on strike not too long ago in hollywood because of AI
[0:32:02] kerodas2: drone shots value will fall down to the bottom
[0:32:06] mordiell: cause you can have one person using AI replace whole teams
[0:32:06] Diamsofer: when jobs are useless by technology new ones are created
[0:32:08] ribas314: and it will be much harder to get a job in this fields if you are just in the beginning of your career
[0:32:09] Ari0n0s: If its more efficent humans will do it , just like min maxing in wow

[0:32:30] tyriev: is this openAI?
[0:32:33] Nunadaaa: surely you cant be replaced by a robot smoo Clueless
[0:32:35] xelm_: somebody posted the github link unsure how safe it is tho
[0:32:36] chr47: The AI is just a clever way to plagiarise tbh
[0:32:39] Nunadaaa: UBI when omE
[0:32:41] NIICKLAS_TV: already seeing youtubers use AI for thumbnails. so no need to have anyone make a thumbnail anymore KEKW
[0:32:44] alextheblight: hell, Microsoft is on board with this
[0:32:45] Nunadaaa: its wild
[0:32:52] Ewriick: om
[0:32:55] rashty92: how youre hate for boomkins work for you?
[0:32:55] Ewriick: saw that guzu?
[0:32:57] LabyrinthMW: Wtf
[0:32:58] criblica: Imagine this "Make me a warcraft themed tv series with Arthas storry line" We can legit make our own TV shows..
[0:32:58] Ewriick: gorse
[0:32:58] Smooo07: Nunadaaa you seriously think a robot can take care of elderly, sick (depressed) people the way humans can?
[0:32:59] light126: Where did the horse go xdd
[0:33:04] Ticklezao: @xelm_ github is usually always safe, but that was fake
[0:33:05] LabyrinthMW: okay yeah
[0:33:07] backstreetalright: this is bonkers guzu
[0:33:08] LabyrinthMW: I didnt notice hat
[0:33:09] Ewriick: gorse !vanish
[0:33:10] Ari0n0s: yea the horses are wrong
[0:33:10] Nunadaaa: @Smooo07 in time? probably more efficietn than we can now
[0:33:11] AvengerDK: fingers
[0:33:13] hanttapuliukko: Learn to use it and adapt. Yeah, some are going to lose their work over to AI, but basically the same has happened many times before and humanity adjusted.
[0:33:14] arrkies91: @guzu next year we will see a whole movie made my AI
[0:33:16] mordiell: theres videos on how to create months of content for a month with AI, you would need whole teams for it before, making graphics, coming up with titles, editing videos/pics. Now you just need one person to write out a good ai prompt
[0:33:16] kerodas2: cowboy wizard monkaS
[0:33:22] auto_wow: the main thing will be like how well you can splice multiple AI videos to be coherent and make sense together
[0:33:27] larrydavidtherogue: HAND MODELS ARE FINE FOR NOW BOYS
[0:33:36] Jellooze: the surge of AI generated fake news is gonna be massive
[0:33:39] dogmano7: Book to movie instantly
[0:33:39] PorryhatterTV: this will put time travelers out of business
[0:33:39] Virtym: some top seller books on kindle are already written by AI
[0:33:41] Nunadaaa: @Smooo07 fact of the matter is that once trained robots are simply far superior than humans PepeHands
[0:33:43] Numline123: guess Snacky's getting fired Kappa
[0:33:49] rallycharly: and tweaking and stuff
[0:33:51] Mr_Moffert: baseg
[0:33:51] xelm_: makes me wonder if in 30 years streamers will all be AI.
[0:33:51] criblica: Imagine this "Make me a warcraft themed tv series with Arthas storry line" We can legit make our own TV shows. gg
[0:33:52] the_ordo_malleus: CGI kinda sticks out anyways so this AI will just be the same and much cheaper i assume.
[0:34:00] Hyzen88: @Numline123 Snacky already is AI
[0:34:01] Ewriick: An AI model can usually only do one thing though, and each model has different obstacles
[0:34:01] light126: Why watch Guzu when you can watch GUzAI?
[0:34:03] Omalley15: snackybox getting fired
[0:34:04] Smooo07: Nunadaaa if that happens were already doomed, imagine not having any social interaction and robots doing everything for you
[0:34:04] Nunadaaa: @xelm_ guzu is already an AI
[0:34:05] ZaweriHC: I find it hilarious that people didnt care about machines replacing people until artists got hurt. How is it a massive issue that artists get replaced by AI (which cannot come up with original content btw) but not say, Greg at the lamp factory getting replaced by a machine? @Guzu

[4:56:50] Googlybearz: Well this isnt Classic, and due to all numbers, it a VERY small margin of players that likes 40 man.. Its ulitimately also why the "First Season" fell apart.. One due to content drought, and people not being able to fill their 40 man roster... They wont make that mistake twice

[5:19:21] ZjakalGames: Chatting One time I typed a really long, post in a streamers chat for him to read. It was literally max character length, and he totally ignored. I thought that he might have missed it, so I kept posing it. Every time i posted it I tried watching his eye movements, I even used the highlight option, and I think he saw it a couple of times but he never acknowledged it.
