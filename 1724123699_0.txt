[1:19:49] TreytorMcDeath: Factory is a PVP paradise, dont start there.  Woods its too easy to get shot by some guy you never see and good players will absolutely shred you.  Customs allows a mix of things while having many landmarkers so its easy to figure out where you are at
[1:19:49] MaxGamerFlame: I dont know how people play streets shit map is scary as fk.

[1:20:48] drunktechchaser: Bro is that Pacman on your Shotgun?
[1:20:49] DrunkenTee: @Ripsnorter_Boon I'd always recommend going Factory with your Scav whenever you can and do PVP so you get to learn it before you attempt to sacrifice your PMC to PVP

Scavs are just people who lived in Tarkov which now turned a Warzone, some (Criminals etc) turned bad.. others are just Scavs (who dont shoot other Scavs) because they just want to live

[4:55:09] paddykillz: @blaasted It's easier than it looks. Classic is easy af and 90% of the Screen-Spam is not important, you could disable it. :D
[4:55:17] SerbossBre: This is Lich King ? :O
[4:55:19] Koffiekoekje: @blaasted Yea makes more sense if you lvl up from lvl 1, learn the class spell by spell
[4:55:25] l1tt: @skidimoo ye its impossible, aka why theres 0 logs for the fight
[4:55:36] KsZombieJesus: @Koffiekoekje the issue was that even sims in ulduar bis didn't reach the required dps

[5:28:51] bonyato: 1 hand rotation must be ret YEP
[5:28:58] LunaRCS: @elswicka You'll probably like Dragonflight then i think the raid is quite good although some shitty bosses in it. And the M+ rotation for the season is pretty good
[5:28:58] vinicrowbr: GenderFluidPride
[5:29:03] chandleriab: @elswicka highly recommend watching a video on the classes as some can be brutal to learn as a new player
[5:29:21] Go_CrazyKL: Hi Shroud ashter2Shades

[5:29:53] LunaRCS: @chandleriab Ye and check the stats of each class and spec cause some are ansolutely useless in raid
[5:30:20] elswicka: @LunaRCS  @chandleriab good stuff - ill read up on that during work tomorrow

[5:31:53] golgothohdoggo: FF XIV is harder in his rotations than WoW
[5:31:58] Zeradicated: Feral, Spellhance sounds more complex to blast than anything what I played before in WoTLK
[5:31:58] chandleriab: @benderintime Idk, as an enh shammy its kinda difficult
[5:31:58] suraxis: @wizzkek brother
[5:31:59] l1tt: disable the bars on the bottom? 5Head
[5:32:00] Vronning: ye
[5:32:02] LunaRCS: Feral is annoying/difficult to do your rotation properly cause they have like 4 different froms
[5:32:05] Alaziara: Your bars are offset monkaGun
[5:32:08] hate_xyz: your UI is clean SeemsGood

[5:32:17] scrimshaww: You'll get used to it, keep the info in the same spot and you'll adjust
[5:32:21] ashkii_uwu: I think it's cool for minimalism, but not necessary for classic
[5:32:22] soClutchItHurts: bar tender da best
[5:32:24] nosebleed__: thats for consecration
[5:32:27] dgreendog: Why you need all that at bottom visable
[5:32:27] cptnkuroky: can just hide bars
[5:32:40] Vronning: its a mana tick timer?

[5:34:42] Vronning: use ur repentance mucgh?
[5:34:43] uFF_Da: @Urlerroii probably a WA - if you search wago for things like "tank stats" you'll find something similar
[5:34:43] ashkii_uwu: You could remove or hide elements to customize it yourself ig
[5:34:43] hate_xyz: @!iiTzSenpii yeah but you can make gold in game to buy a wow token that pays for a month
[5:34:45] matching_towels: Yeah retail wow needs to show procs/buffs better by default
[5:34:55] Malkavien13: in wotlk wasn't there a squawk and awe for pally?

[5:36:21] Lexide: add-ons cripple your gameplay make you worse. imagine if you had a weak aura in dark souls telling you when to roll. just dumbs the game and the player down.

[5:39:54] HenaruSan: @l1tt i know that, but most useful addons like weak aura are used to track events - buffs - debuffs pvp or pve
[5:40:00] illists: what do people use for addons now days "overwolk" sucks
[5:40:06] illists: wolf*
[5:40:12] uFF_Da: WA is a single addon

[5:41:06] illists: Thx^^
[5:41:12] uFF_Da: ya. But im saying WAs is like the only one that people use for buffs/debuffs
[5:41:12] LunaRCS: is this a pug or an actualy raid group shroud is playing with?

[6:06:50] RerQ: I hated this part of WoW, where as a warrior/pally etc you'd wear leather/mail
[6:06:53] orderxv: Being under expertise cap for ret isnt that bad since most of your dmg is from spells that csnt be dodged
[6:06:55] bambi838: Do you go expertise capped before going full strength?

[6:07:56] Asparagus93: listen this is how you do it
[6:07:59] ClassicMalcontent: @RerQ that was mostly vanilla some TBC. By Wrath I remember using gear type relevant to class.
[6:08:00] kimbx: cata sux balls
[6:08:02] ausderdose: some of the audio sounds really nose clogged somehow
[6:08:03] Cascus4Life: I bet they never do Shadowlands as a classic. Ever.
[6:08:04] extrabacon: no way they dont do cata
[6:08:07] ausderdose: including shroud
[6:08:09] MysticalOS: they'll do cata with changes, people forget cata started good, just ended bad. so change the ending
[6:08:09] Asparagus93: launch fresh vanilla, fresh tbc and fresh wotlk realms on a 3-4 month rotating cycle
[6:08:09] Jeys7n: they're gonna do dragonflight right after wrath. EZ
[6:08:13] Asparagus93: separate from eachother
[6:08:15] suraxis: COPE

[6:08:19] Spalorne: i hope there is no cata haha dragontails is pretty fun tho
[6:08:23] suraxis: COPE COPE
[6:08:23] Asparagus93: and you have an actual money printer that never ends
[6:08:24] RerQ: @ClassicMalcontent yeah same, by the time I got to ICC I was in all plate I think. I just hated it so much lol
[6:08:25] chandleriab: theres no way

[6:10:13] l1tt: @lukeguy31 ground beef
[6:10:14] Halzinky: Its the LFD and LFR introduction in cata that ruined it

[6:18:11] Adras_: guys which addon he uses for displaying the life bars of his allies in the raid group?
[6:18:19] MysticalOS: survivability one too
[6:18:21] uFF_Da: so if hunter has aimed shot you can try cut the heal if tank died
[6:18:38] uFF_Da: or rogue can poison. but that's a dps loss quite a bit
[6:18:50] Omni35: I don't have to explain myself to a weasel
[6:18:52] ragebeardo: You NEED an MS effect, no chance without
[6:18:53] uFF_Da: but the tank will have a debuff and is 100% at the timer
[6:19:06] uFF_Da: if yu don't kill in time, guaranateed 1 death and heal
[6:19:19] shadowsundertide: only heals 20% tho with MS
[6:19:28] JAMESLMFAO: HeadBang
[6:19:28] psyonikk: yo
[6:19:47] bambi838: Do you go for expertise capped before full strength?
[6:19:51] uFF_Da: having some heal reduction is huge in case the DPS can't beat the timer. we beat this with tank dying.

[7:21:00] diamondbuttcheeks: u trying hard modes?
[7:21:01] lolJax1: @HereticAstartes but me as disc had 8k hps on this fight when we 4man healed. From what I remember is that healers go oom in the last phase and if someone die healers cannot keep up
[7:21:08] loppeo: @j0vl yogg0 is hardest
[7:21:17] Praecordia: Is council a gear fight or just hard?

[7:21:58] Uplifted: so what's the secret to daeling with this boss?
[7:21:58] osoi____: shroud1 shroud2
[7:22:04] trekoni: i think wotlk is slightly on the downslope of the peak tbh but still really fun
[7:22:04] HereticAstartes: @lolJax1 hm i see, im just leveling up my disc priest atm but the videos ive seen of ulduar i see a bit higher healing as well. Thats what im kind of confused about. Maybe dps is just a bit low or the tank is just a bit special i have no idea
[7:22:05] Runeheal_: @Praecordia execution fight, doable in full naxx gear but hard
[7:22:09] J0VL: @loppeo I think probably a tie between yogg 0 and mim HM. Both are super tough for different reasons I think. Idk, tough to compare.
[7:22:13] loppeo: @wolfinosg xt just Got nurfed to the ground
[7:22:29] slowChroma: @Uplifted pretty sure melee taunts for the dps race
[7:22:34] dpjzz: what's shroud playing as??
[7:22:36] ChubbyMikey: @trecfori well, back when this stuff was current, the post Wrath stuff was terrible too, so if classic goes south, it'll be just like the old days
[7:22:49] Vronning: yogg 0 isnt hard
[7:22:55] Summerville: Some raids have insane DPS and shitty healers
[7:22:55] HereticAstartes: @dpjzz shadowpriest

[7:23:09] slowChroma: why dk not mt?
[7:23:09] Vronning: its no difference from yogg 4 execution wise, u just have to not be greedy in last phase
[7:23:10] slime__gg: my guild cant even get a full 25
[7:23:11] Runeheal_: @HereticAstartes disc can pad a  lot  in p3 on this  fight, you should be aiming to keep the people standing at   range in p3 bubbled nonstop which  is less hps than randomly spamming them
[7:23:14] dpjzz: @hereticastartes thank you
[7:23:22] ChubbyMikey: shroud is Ret right now, isn't he?
[7:23:29] Lemmnaid: yeah

[8:32:43] Praey92: hello mister @shroud is this skadadin paladin skadoodle from cs?
[8:32:45] maddux_tv: nah, stronk disagree
[8:32:46] Brakdin_: Velma is so bad it makes people want to watch it. So that makes it a profitable show.
[8:33:01] maddux_tv: Last of Us show is some dawg BibleThump BibleThump

[8:33:58] soldiers2kappa: wotlk
[8:34:16] PerrySqrd: it actually puzzling how hbo can make something like last of us alongside of a fucking velma LULW
[8:34:17] AyPeanut_: nkoWiggle
[8:34:44] WhatsMyBuckets: Is this period appropriate music?!
[8:34:50] Praecordia: There is alooooot of Rise Against in this playlist
[8:35:11] crudbox: HBO and HBO max are different divisions, and it shows
[8:35:17] maddux_tv: @PerrySqrd hbo hires producers and gives em money to make the projects. the producer of the last of us is a renowned producer
[8:35:21] DuskySnarf: RareParrot
[8:35:22] Lianquerry: You have too much mana! Use a bit more Kappa
[8:35:23] maddux_tv: the one for velma isnt, i believe.
[8:35:34] Brakdin_: The one for velma is renowned
[8:35:44] PerrySqrd: well somebody inside HBO approved velma for release, no? there 100% were shows that were cancelled during production
[8:35:45] maddux_tv: @Brakdin_ oof, then he must suck LUL
[8:35:51] maddux_tv: atleast in terms of that kind of project
[8:35:51] Neskymos: what addon you do use for CD numbers on the abillities, is it OmniCC or something different?
[8:35:52] Brakdin_: She was a head writer on The Office and has done other shows that are big.
[8:35:54] cumminspower09: Are you doing a full clear?
[8:36:14] Brakdin_: The thing is like I said earlier, everyone is shittting on the show but it's pushing big numbers. Their tactic is working.
[8:36:17] farmshank: @Demonify i meant ukraine/russia for eastern europe easily 24-25hr flights, turkey pretty south
[8:36:23] lukalarma: where is the mage pump?
[8:36:24] osoi____: catKISS
[8:36:27] maddux_tv: @Brakdin_ the office and velma are vastly different though, i would've gone for one of the OG writers for the movies/late 2009's shows
[8:36:54] BGL_Happy: this song slaps
[8:36:56] maddux_tv: then again, theres a reason why I'm not a renowned producer
[8:36:57] tracemuch: lol wut he playing with ghazzy
[8:36:59] Praecordia: Mythic on retail or?
[8:37:04] Doggekek: 5 dk's 🤔
[8:37:10] Brakdin_: @Brakdin_ They are different, but she was one of the most hated characters on the office and she wrote that character. Negativity gets more publicity than positivity.

[10:34:45] SgtSport: @gnasherreloadz dont think youve ever had a IGL before
[10:34:49] Smokespell: believe so when you hit the last phase when all the adds are gone the boss will be lower where the raid damage becomes yuge
[10:35:09] leblubtato: @gnasherreloadz if hes annoying then keep it to yourself.
