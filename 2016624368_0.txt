[0:28:53] IntelHD_: So, being cute and kawaii is honestly pretty cool. It's like, who wouldn't want to bring some sweetness into their life, you know? It's not just about looking cute; it's about surrounding yourself with things that make you happy, like cute plushies or those adorable pastel aesthetics. Internet culture just adds this extra flair to it, with cute memes and emojis making everything feel, like, way more fun. It's all about those good vibes and, like, spreading positivity without being over the top.
