[0:41:56] MourvinMad: i mean its 5-7 domestic so id put it at 2 weeks

[0:42:26] Armdel: wouldn't it ship out of their european warehouses if its ordered from there
[0:42:26] aeon0987: @Aquadriel if it works like conquest then valor is sorta useless
[0:42:39] heavenscloud1517: the valor cap works the same as conquest, increases each week but if you are behind you can keep grinding until you catch up
[0:42:45] Aquadriel: Yostin it does, you cap 5750 this week and next week can only get 750
[0:42:58] jamarky23: @Armdel they have EU warehouse?
[0:42:58] BMagicTX: No facecam anymore?

[2:30:23] 3663Sharad: Double Time + Devastator
[2:30:27] smashwow: roger trying to fly under the radar and shit Kappa
[2:30:41] Vile_: Double Time is the play, for sure.
[2:30:45] Roughers: Devastator is odd feeling but great
[2:30:51] Cyberl0c0: double time will give u more charge and leap, therefore more shield block right?
[2:31:10] forcegamerrr: With so much rage, devastator is fine cause you just fill with revenge instead

[2:36:06] Nico_vdM: rsham ;)
[2:36:10] Kromede: shaman
[2:36:16] Ambersulfr: If you haven't healed before, disc priest is probably one of the harder starters.
[2:36:20] ventu105: so shaman is better
[2:36:24] Ambersulfr: druid or shaman is a good intro
[2:36:26] Roobi_doobi: shaman is better if you are a new healer
[2:36:31] ventu105: ty
[2:36:35] Roobi_doobi: disc is good if you are a healer vet
[2:36:49] Nico_vdM: you could start holy priest or druid as starter as well
[2:36:55] ventu105: good i will check druid then lol

[2:40:16] Nico_vdM: I left dev on bar, still found myself pressing it often

[2:40:36] Ambersulfr: I'm not a fan of maelstrom but I main shaman anyway (resto, but play ele). It's not bad. The "buff" looked pretty neutral overall to me. Ele is still middle of the pack.

[2:42:15] Kromede: rip
[2:42:16] AstridLory: Why do you use dps oil and flask instead of stamina one?
[2:42:17] Sunbull01: why towellie not streaming with camera?
[2:42:24] aleck1776: YOLO
[2:42:30] Nico_vdM: bolster it up
[2:42:32] Ambersulfr: It's fun, but it can be overwhelming depending how good you are. If you do the full rotation for max DPS it can get to be a lot. I've seen a few people play it and end up doing awfully low dmg because the rotation is so complex they can't do it and keep an eye on what's going on around them.
[2:42:35] majestictaco0: Bolstering woof
[2:42:46] 3663Sharad: Bolstering goes Reeee
[2:42:46] Nico_vdM: !cam @sunbull01
[2:42:47] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while
[2:43:14] Sunbull01: aha, okay, have a good revovery
[2:43:20] Ambersulfr: If you know your way around it already you'll probably be fine.

[3:47:45] rocthenite: amazing game, just got fucked with release timing
[3:47:58] jdickson93: i was so bummed with CoD WWII, World at War was my favorite CoD and i was hoping it would be more like that
[3:48:04] mayhemguy: raven software made Warzone
[3:48:26] Chiphazzord: WWII started so bad but as it got older the devs never gave up on it and made massive improvments
[3:48:27] Fl3tchTTV: Emeni quest is the fucking worst. takes way too long

[3:50:40] Picard2207: is there some kind of bug that not everybody got their tree mount yet??
[3:51:15] Reckless_Monk: Anthem looked so beautifl
[3:51:46] therealhotwheels: Anthem had so much potential
[3:51:53] Colt_Engineer: Mass Effect needs to be their next priority because Bioware is like a couple more failures from shutting down
[3:52:05] fistofnature: @Towelliee is blood spattered scale good for tanks?
[3:52:05] Klauzzer: it eees what it eeees
[3:52:06] a_scoootz: anthem had SO much potential
[3:52:19] AlphaRocket: what class are you playing currently
[3:52:20] michaisn: Anthem had alot of potential, unique flying, beautiful graphics and the optimization was decent. Honestly they did the harder part

[3:52:33] Tomanak: Tomanak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[3:52:34] mario32: i remember call of duty was popular people would be lining up early the game stores
[3:52:34] Mr_Pennywise_: towHAMUP towHAMUP
[3:52:36] Colt_Engineer: No, Bioware had 6 years to work on it and didn't start work until 1 and half before release
[3:52:43] Sincline387: Anthem died because the hype was so over the top that people didn't give it time to mature
[3:52:44] Foglatch: Imagine thinking people will buy Dragon Age after so many of them were burned by Anthem and Andromeda
[3:52:47] Fl3tchTTV: Harry Potter and the Audacity of This Bitch
[3:52:53] LoremasterMarthan: EA rushes game, game fails, EA tosses 2 years worth of funding to Bioware to remake the game, 2 years of funding later tell bioware "ya know what nevermind we dont want to do this anymore"
[3:53:17] Foglatch: EA is terrible
[3:53:28] duhworks: it's 50/50 they are both to blame
[3:53:31] Fl3tchTTV: they were working on it for 6 years, but 2 years before release they scrapped everything to make it a live service game
[3:53:44] Fl3tchTTV: so thats why it was shit, it was never meant to be live service, but EA got greedy
[3:53:47] Colt_Engineer: @Fl3tchlive exactly
[3:53:52] Reckless_Monk: RoI though
[3:53:52] KingSlayerYotam: i only really liked dragon age origins, that game was the pinnacle of RPG
[3:53:54] mario32: yeah star wars had hacks and stuff
[3:54:05] LoremasterMarthan: Developers need to stop making every game a live service game - that is where like 99% of current video game issues evolve from
[3:54:07] mo197: like Blizzard was rushed for this Expansion by the overlords

[3:54:30] Maydie6066: @Towelliee SWTOR wasnt "rushed" imo, it failed because it's game engine wasnt good at all for the instant action they wanted like WoW provides. it was a very LOTRO engine where it was designed for a turn based fight

[3:54:44] jaysteea: cyberpunk disasater
[3:54:46] raymond3195: don't bad mouth swtor better than shadowlands
[3:54:49] DocsMistake: time to order lunch and grind on classic wow until it is time to hit the gym this afternoon
[3:54:52] RodneyIsPro: kinda wish they pushed it back LUL
[3:54:56] RodneyIsPro: again
[3:54:56] TweakT: if only they made games without microtransactions, imagine what nice games we’d have
[3:55:21] Reckless_Monk: SL is good for wut we got during covid
[3:56:15] h_u_r_k_: gimmie muh mount pepeMeltdown
[3:56:24] SilkeySmooth: blizzard gets a pass from me because of covid
[3:56:30] Zettabyte: REEE! marketing companies calling me @Towelliee! make them shtoooop xD
[3:56:45] matt2d2007: and overwatch 2 would come out this year lol without covid
[3:56:45] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[3:56:48] akafrosty4: SL is bad?
[3:56:57] SilkeySmooth: not bad boring
[3:57:06] GrimExecutable: I can agree with them there. Im the best off Ive every been because of this pandemic LOL
[3:57:11] Reckless_Monk: Nah SL is fine
[3:57:11] Zettabyte: @Towelliee unless i tell them about your gFuel campaign though towLul
[3:57:26] LoremasterMarthan: It's 500 feet wide and 2 feet deep
[3:57:26] BRUTALIT0PS: The story is great, but there just isn't much to do
[3:57:39] SilkeySmooth: Sl is just boring
[3:57:41] Xailen: it has lots of content but most of it is/was gated by time
[3:57:45] Klauzzer: idk i still dont feels like i have enough time to do all the shit
[3:58:07] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee have you changed covenants and then changed back at all. do you keep your progression?
[3:58:08] duhworks: a lot of the content is pointless
[3:58:14] actionbill: It’s the best expansion I’ve played as someone who can only play for about 1.5 hours a day
[3:58:16] jdickson93: i just want to get anima faster to be able to buy the cosmetic things LUL
[3:58:19] LoremasterMarthan: Which for all we know was there intention with their wanting to make a more "casual" game
[3:58:24] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like this is largely what people told blizzard they wanted though. They asked for less busy work and we got less busy work.
[3:58:37] Reckless_Monk: Ithink keystone being how it is for gear progression is, its just ok
[3:58:37] SilkeySmooth: @Towelliee my gut feeling by year 2 shadowlands wil lbe booming unless they give up
[3:58:41] KingSlayerYotam: who would have thought casual players dont wanna grind a lot for gear
[3:58:51] Sincline387: the issue is just as much with the players as the game, we asked for less grinding....and now "there's nothing to do"
[3:59:01] Zettabyte: @Towelliee and check my video post in disc after stream, you'll LOVE it xD
[3:59:16] Teebees: wheres the valor dude?
[3:59:19] JusticeRainsFromBehind: How’s the damage buff on prot warr feel?
[3:59:21] Reckless_Monk: Cus not alt friendly
[3:59:22] Gregadeaux: Bruh I'm pretty sure you were complaining about that exact thing at the beginning. That you had to grind constantly to stay competitive
[3:59:33] xvstormvx: @Towelliee well it was that not all of us have all day to play to be as strong as your toon was
[4:00:02] FranciscoTheMage: thye buffed or nerfed the Calling quests World Quests?
[4:00:18] TweakT: I wonder what priority list blizzard has in sending out the wandering ancient mount, still havent gotten mine
[4:00:32] karbonMAYne: I like PvE but there's literally no point for me to grind dungeons/raid when I can just PvP
[4:00:34] Sincline387: "to get 226 gear easily" isn't a statement that should be made
[4:00:56] FranciscoTheMage: people in my guild are so upset about the Tree mount @Towelliee @TweakT  they put in tickets. i think you just have to be patient
[4:00:57] TweakT: saw a dude on the mount, he gets all the betas, there must be a good boy list
[4:01:22] jdickson93: i had the mount right when i logged in yesterday LUL
[4:01:25] Gregadeaux: I dunno man. At the beginning of this expansion, you were praising the lack of grind.
[4:01:40] sdpercussion: lack of grind but also complete lack of gear
[4:01:50] rocthenite: i won't be shock if bfa is look back on foundly
[4:01:51] JukasZor: what made you swap your warrior to necro?
[4:02:00] ohnot___her: Its the same shit
[4:02:03] sdpercussion: they F*cked this season with the low drop rates and no valor
[4:02:10] ohnot___her: this is why Blizz/activision will never be able to win
[4:02:12] Gregadeaux: I get you
[4:02:13] Tipullo: So what's the most efficient way of getting valor? Low keys?
[4:02:15] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like everyone said they wanted badges back, but blizzard just added valor from Mop and it isn't as good.
[4:02:34] SilkeySmooth: all there is left is alts
[4:02:38] rocthenite: i mean it went down due to bfa
[4:02:43] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[4:02:55] TweakT: theyre all playing classic
[4:02:57] sdpercussion: valor might not be perfect but if it was in from the beginning it wouldnt even have been a grind. just upgrade stuff as you go to fill in the sub 226 slots
[4:02:58] TweakT: Kapp
[4:03:13] Klauzzer: i can only gear one LUL
[4:03:18] SilkeySmooth: classic wow is dead people aretired of clearing nexx
[4:03:36] TweakT: I havent even cleared naxx I just lvl
[4:03:44] Klauzzer: when then again i do unecessary shit for transmog
[4:03:45] TweakT: too many bots to afford raiding
[4:03:52] kissmysass9: world quests are still 25%
[4:03:52] SilkeySmooth: people are just leveling alts for tbc
[4:03:58] ohnot___her: People hate the grind, blizz listens and changes the way so you dont have to grind anymore. and now people are complaining theres no grind
[4:03:59] Carryout: @Towelliee this is also the first earnings report with out all the multiboxers also, dont forget all the accounts that didnt resub for that
[4:03:59] jarilrpg: i think SL can be summed up in the one line. "Your time doesnt feel rewarded." world quests need to give more anima, loot needs to drop more, torghast needs more cosmetics or something
[4:04:04] ohnot___her: Its kinda annoying
[4:04:22] Gregadeaux: Hard to tell if it would have had retention if you were grinding the whole time. BFA and Legion had worse retention than Shadowlands did, didn't it? I think you touched on the issue yesterday, that we would have been in x.1 at this point in BFA and Legion.
[4:04:27] rocthenite: @Towelliee i hate that people forgot that wrath was straight up hated back in the day with TB making hate videos on wrath and the "cawsrals" ruining the game
[4:04:33] ArcaneSyntax: Classic is even more dead than retail is. TBC is giving a minor shot in the arm, but until it launches it's gonna be dead.
[4:04:52] Einzbern: lfr in tbc!? PogChamp
[4:05:12] Templexx: LFG? lol
[4:05:15] SilkeySmooth: ill but some tokens:P
[4:05:17] ShaunsterTheMonster: Wow token
[4:05:19] SilkeySmooth: buy
[4:05:19] Gregadeaux: We would have already started raid 2 at this point in BFA
[4:05:21] sdpercussion: getting rid of bonus rolls and forging was fine. but nerfing loot drop rates into the ground was such bs
[4:05:34] sdpercussion: if they had valor and didnt nerf drop rates things wouldbe cool
[4:05:54] sdpercussion: the vault ABSOLUTELY does not make up for the lower drop rates
[4:06:03] KnsWoW: I want tokens
[4:06:03] Xilyane: @Gregadeaux And yet SL is still better than BFA. BFA was that bad
[4:06:04] ohnot___her: Theyre gonna change the loot in 9.1 they already changed the loot for raids tbh
[4:06:17] RunklePunch: i like when you think out loud
[4:06:17] SilkeySmooth: they mite announce it after beta when people are hooked
[4:06:20] warrenny: @gregadeaux Covid delays everything
[4:06:26] remedyt: both would help but dont fix the problem
[4:06:31] Gregadeaux: @xilyane I agree. That's kind of where I'm going. The issues with shadowlands stem from the delays. Not from the lack of grind
[4:06:34] rocthenite: bald man is going to be angry
[4:06:41] rocthenite: oh god no
[4:06:44] ArcaneSyntax: @Towelliee bots wouldn't exist in classic if there wasnt a demand for buying gold.
[4:06:50] Gregadeaux: And delays are warranted if they aren't ready for release
[4:06:57] SilkeySmooth: raid only so broken sets?
[4:07:03] rocthenite: preach on suiside watch
[4:07:16] sdpercussion: 3 drops from a m+ and valor would basically fix everything imo
[4:07:41] bigchilln_: !tbc

[4:07:45] nadmortv: Nadmor subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:07:47] sdpercussion: would keep the loot flow and upgradesability at a decent pace
[4:07:55] Gregadeaux: I think the drop rate conversation is very interesting. RIght now, we're saying we want more of a grind. And then at the same time, we're saying "please get rid of the grind for gear"
[4:07:58] rocthenite: no he hated banthic
[4:08:19] RunklePunch: is this the round of 16?
[4:08:24] MrGattz: were ahead but also behind sacHMM
[4:08:32] ArcaneSyntax: Preach could just stop raiding as hardcore as he does and he'd be a lot happier with the game.
[4:08:43] MrGattz: just give terry like 5 grand to boost that shit
[4:08:44] ohnot___her: @Gregadeaux Im just tired of seeing the same thing. Blizz finally listened to people complaining about the grind and now they did something and were right back into, we need more of a grind
[4:09:00] DanielTheMedic: need my hit of gfuel
[4:09:00] Mattsta: the only thing i remember sucking about benthic was the super random chance at the tertiary/sockets
[4:09:07] BRUTALIT0PS: What if I know the homeless man on the corner is big on GFuel?
[4:09:13] MrGattz: !gfuel
[4:09:14] Moobot: Towelliee is sponsored by G FUEL! The official energy drink of ESPORTS and THE HAMMER SQUAD! towHAMUP Use code ➡ TOWEL ⬅ at checkout for some % off! gfuel.ly/3kf8stb
[4:09:28] rocthenite: @ArcaneSyntax he is thinking about it for next tier, he said playing his alts without worrying about the raids was the most fun he ha d in wow in years
[4:09:41] BRUTALIT0PS: I mean, he can use my phone LUL
[4:09:43] Gregadeaux: And I mean, I'm not going to lie. I'm feeling the same things Towelliee is talking about. I log on to retail now on raid nights, and that's it. But I think overall, I am more satisfied with my WoW experience than I was with BFA
[4:09:45] PokerFaceMoose: whelp the dang robot vacuum just turned off my pc
[4:10:16] Trekxx: which is good
[4:10:32] Trekxx: because they can actually focus on making the game instead of having to fix system issues like in BFA
[4:10:37] Hawkzerr: Chat question about ZG. Has a 70 pally in TBC can you solo ZG to farm tiger mount?
[4:10:39] ohnot___her: @Gregadeaux I mean maybe its different for people who are in a guild rn. I can understand that. CN killed my guild and trying to find a new home is giving me more time to play and try out new classes
[4:10:47] Trekxx: that new 9.1 raid is gonna be transmog heaven
[4:10:49] rocthenite: so lightforge cursable? still awful
[4:10:53] myguyhood: so where did u get benthic gear from lol
[4:10:56] Gregadeaux: BFA, I logged in every day and did every single world quest for like 2 months. And by the time we were halfway through Mythic Uldir, I was ready to stop playing entirely
[4:11:08] GamerKillance: This patch NO people back lol
[4:11:08] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:11:17] GamerKillance: Valor for M+ only is such a stupid idea
[4:11:18] Gregadeaux: And I did stop playing. I basically quit right as 8.1 came out because I was burned out
[4:11:48] Gregadeaux: Now, I have less to do, but I'm having more fun doing it

[4:17:51] KronasKG: Feel free to invite me: BM Hunter Kronas-laughingskull
[4:18:44] dimofodi: @instant_savage I think you should be able to choose between Valor/Conquest if you do M+/Arena/something for raid? They could easily give you options there instead of just Stygia.
[4:18:50] xanione: quality stuff
[4:19:08] DanielTheMedic: its like NOTICE MEEE
[4:19:10] dimofodi: Probably just need to reload UI
[4:19:11] Armdel: looks like the animation froze

[4:19:32] dimofodi: It froze updating the data for it
[4:19:51] sdpercussion: @Towelliee why are you doing wqs?
[4:20:22] MrGattz: i saw terry was getting random dcs as well
[4:20:35] scrribbles: The Blood price DCs were happening hardcore in our raid too
[4:20:50] satinxdd: same
[4:20:53] Affiiance: Yeah we had DCs last night too
[4:21:09] Foglatch: I have been unable to complete leveling dungeons, first mauradon had all enemies evade and then grim batol dragons wouldn't take off
[4:21:16] dusty_crusty58: Yea people were having issues as well, especially when the adds come out 1st phase
[4:21:19] sdpercussion: ah renoun ok

[4:21:53] Horseweave: *PF 2
[4:21:56] sdpercussion: and then spam 2's for gear, renown and valor
[4:21:59] Nemo2510: got a +8 xD
[4:22:01] sdpercussion: dont bother with wqs
[4:22:03] D3m0nHunt3r666: gotta take a risk and pug those 2
[4:22:10] scrribbles: yeah, it was bad. ):
[4:22:17] Abyssus101: why no cam man?
[4:22:24] MrGattz: !cam
[4:22:24] Moobot: towelliee is currently taking some medication for his skin that requires him not to wear a shirt. so in the interest of not breaking TOS, he wont have a cam on for a little while

[4:23:08] Audiodisaster: Yes, 135 garunteed. tiemd or not
[4:23:18] jemfaker: honestly, 12+ is easier than a 2 pugging. People be wild in lower keys
[4:23:23] Shifthappens192: Yep
[4:23:27] heavenscloud1517: you get valor no matter what, the problem is that even lower keys reward the same amount as higher keys, which I feel they will adjust
[4:23:30] scrribbles: ouch
[4:23:32] TheDabbai: not having pride hurts
[4:23:37] scrribbles: 7 hours
[4:23:37] Klauzzer: it once took me like 2 hours to complete a +2
[4:23:42] sdpercussion: not on 7s it doesnt
[4:23:57] Jesperoni: lol me and a few guildies just grinded +2
[4:24:01] dimofodi: I don't do lower keys if I can see straight so they typically take me longer than high keys. :D
[4:24:03] Jesperoni: with tank and 4 dps
[4:24:03] instant_savage: !cam

[4:34:51] TweakT: I do m0 every week, get 213 from vault KEKW
[4:35:08] pk99: @TweakT wut
[4:35:08] fistofnature: Vial does alot of single target dps
[4:35:13] Klauzzer: SMOrc
[4:35:13] MWilco77: @Towelliee I live in the country, farm work in the summer for high school, so ringworm was common. We used to cut a green walnut and rub it on the ringworm. Shit was gone in 3 days.
[4:35:14] roostrr42: bolstering tyrannical is just so much fun
[4:35:20] daftnatetv: @Towelliee honest opinon...basically only pug on my prot warrior...i think banner is gabro unless you have dps to capitalize. Stay Kyrian? or go Necro
[4:35:25] TweakT: I swer @pk99
[4:35:30] DattommyWafflez: shadowlands is a game that is designed for competitive players, by competitive players. They neglect fun aspects of a game tokens (AT LAUNCH), tangible end  game content (mythic + ruined solo play).+
[4:35:39] iamdreh: he rocking reprisal now?
[4:35:55] Lincoln_WoW: is that a copy pasta
[4:36:05] DattommyWafflez: Yes
[4:36:08] GamerKillance: @Towelliee There is no grind for anyone outside of hardcore grinding
[4:36:12] heavenscloud1517: solo play?
[4:36:26] DattommyWafflez: People then forget how to have fun w/ the game, player base falls off
[4:36:30] Scraggersmeh: What do casuals even need loot for? They don't do any content.
[4:36:31] DattommyWafflez: nah i just typed that
[4:36:37] 91Niki: Maybe not upper upper end, but it defiantly doesn't cater to the super casuals
[4:37:04] TweakT: for the clout @scraggersmeh
[4:37:06] Bayless_TV: Banner is basically utility yeah.
[4:37:10] DattommyWafflez: solo play = pugging. which is basically non-existent
[4:37:12] GamerKillance: @Scraggersmeh Its not the loot, but the grind. Also casual doesn't equal a bad player. Don't cofuse those two. Plenty of casuals that do Mythic raiding
[4:37:13] SycosFamily: What are your talents?
[4:37:15] Scraggersmeh: What clout? They don't do any content that gets them clout lol
[4:37:16] TweakT: casuals wanna feel important too
[4:37:19] daftnatetv: @Towelliee thanks my dude, appreicate the thoughts
[4:37:29] Scraggersmeh: Casuals who mythic raid aren't the ones complaining about loot, GamerKillance
[4:37:31] DattommyWafflez: Casual playerbase is what carries ANY game
[4:37:33] Scraggersmeh: The dudes who don't do content are.
[4:37:34] j_hooligan: fleshcraft feels good now
[4:37:37] tidy_cats_marketing: how is warrior now for m+? @towelliee
[4:37:48] iamdreh: you rocking reprisal now sir? or still thunder
[4:38:06] GamerKillance: @Scraggersmeh Like I said it isn't loot. You're listening to a VERY small entitled group of players. The current issue is there is NO grind outside of hardcore content
[4:38:10] TweakT: ngl, I like getting 213 loot from vault by doing 1 m0 a week
[4:38:23] SumZeroGG: Is ignore pain your other regular defensive outside shield block
[4:38:26] TweakT: knowing that 226 is max I aint complaining KEKW
[4:38:32] GamerKillance: @Scraggersmeh Take out the grind you lose the players. THe recent numbers of WoW nearly losing half their players shows
[4:38:47] ursinealli: you can't get loot from the vault doing mythic 0's, you have to do at least a +2 because that's the lowest keystone level
[4:38:50] getflnked: how op is banned
[4:38:59] TweakT: wrong
[4:39:06] TweakT: I did an m0 yday
[4:39:12] Sepron14: @TweakT  You cant get vault loot from M0
[4:39:13] TweakT: got 213 heroic pants
[4:39:14] iamdreh: damnnn time to get my warr up too 💪💪
[4:39:21] TweakT: I fuckin did man wth
[4:39:35] Sepron14: The whole WoW fan base can prove you didnt
[4:39:36] TweakT: but my ilvl is 196
[4:39:39] TweakT: or was
[4:39:44] instant_savage: tyranical and storming
[4:39:44] TweakT: and 30 renown
[4:39:45] dmac614: So is valor the same amount no what key you run?
[4:39:54] TweakT: Im special
[4:39:58] TweakT: not an alt
[4:40:06] Creative_Pigeon: 293
[4:40:15] instant_savage: nvm u have bolstering
[4:40:25] RoboMaximillion: you have to
[4:40:56] TweakT: I think vault rewards you based on char ilvl not just the key nr u did
[4:40:59] Creative_Pigeon: your IO right now is 293 btw
[4:41:12] ursinealli: no, the vault is not based on your ilvl

[4:42:17] fistofnature: noob tank 😡
[4:42:19] Foglatch: those slimes are raid bosses by now
[4:42:26] Sepron14: @ursinealli He may be from the EU
[4:42:26] Klauzzer: kick tank
[4:42:26] ursinealli: You'd have to have done something last week to get a vault item yesterday
[4:42:29] SethSteckler: your char ilvl has absolutely 0 relation to your vault reward
[4:42:31] FranciscoTheMage: i dont understand this farming of valor.. @Towelliee why would blizz allow people to do that
[4:42:35] TweakT: EU @ursinealli
[4:42:38] ursinealli: ah
[4:42:39] TweakT: raid reset is wed
[4:42:55] FranciscoTheMage: you can farm the same key and get valor after valor?
[4:43:00] Hawkzerr: Was TBC beta leaked? I see it on peeps stream but no one answers...lol
[4:43:08] TweakT: maybe the renown level then @sethsteckler
[4:43:28] FranciscoTheMage: i think some betas went out
[4:43:32] ursinealli: no it's not based on renown either
[4:43:39] Sepron14: @TweakT Are you trolling now? we keep telling you its based on the Level of the key you do or its based on the raid diffciculty you do
[4:43:47] MrGattz: @Hawkzer11 no. also there is no beta yet. also if you see anyone on twitch streaming actual tbc servers report them because its a private server and your not allowed to stream private servers on twitch
[4:43:49] TweakT: then maybe Im just a lucky boy idk xD
[4:44:00] xiriskosoleny: where is your cam fatass ?
[4:44:12] ursinealli: did you maybe forget to loot your vault last week? and it's left over?
[4:44:25] TweakT: I swear to all the boyscout gods dude I got 213 pants from doing a single m0 dungeon last night
[4:44:25] deedeemegadoodooo: lol they didnt move from the slime

[4:44:56] Sepron14: Aye did you do a mythic keystone many weeks ago @TweakT  ?

[5:13:51] Hydrotechnics: Premade Group Finder is a decent addon. Helps you filter out groups that already have certain roles, and for particular dungeons
[5:14:20] SuddenHuevos: Interrupts lose dps KEKW
[5:14:32] karbonMAYne: yes

[5:19:27] SuddenHuevos: Pugs in lower is kek
[5:19:28] smashwow: welcome to the jungle
[5:19:30] yngwiemalmst: 9 is like the worst key level to run also since no pride
[5:19:39] motorboatingpro: prideful is awesome, 9's are way harder than 10, 11, 12, IMO
[5:19:43] DonAndolini: low keys is where players push the boundaries of mechanics and gameplay
[5:19:46] smashwow: yeah a 9 is awful
[5:20:11] 3v3r35t_: Yes, 18-20 feels easier than 14-15s
[5:20:20] actionbill: My first tank key was a +5 halls and I spent like 30 seconds trying to unfear our group because they ran away from the circle LUL
[5:20:23] DonAndolini: not in a good way always
[5:20:23] geojama93: what is his covenant for prot?
[5:20:29] Shifthappens192: It goes one of two ways people stick with it or they leave after one wipe. In low keys that I have done
[5:20:36] visi1761: before they needed NW I was in a +3 for 3 hours.  it was torture
[5:20:36] MrGattz: the higher the keys the more skilled and knowledgeable people are at them. its easier to run keys at a +7 +8 because by then people know the optimal runs. at least imo
[5:21:00] MrGattz: +10 or higher you get carry runs so thats no good and lower than a +5 people are still learning
[5:21:26] yngwiemalmst: i mean +7 ppl still dont know what they doing lol

[5:21:56] SuddenHuevos: Nerf said 9.1 he will play
[5:21:57] MrGattz: @yngwiemalmst true. but you are less likely to run into people that dont know what they are doing at a +7 than a +4
