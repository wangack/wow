[2:45:04] honklestein: Octarine
[2:45:09] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 Nope, thats completely incorect, sorry. We were given to Sweden as war concessions by Denmark, since they were on different sides of the war.

[2:45:59] Shanadir: redaga
[2:46:01] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 Then Norway got our own prince, but Sweden obviously wanted its war concessions, and it allmost came to war. But Norway and Sweden accepted a treaty and created the Union.

[2:46:46] power_corveus: Ive just scene motorbike centaurs ina commercial, and Im so confused
[2:46:52] Darrullo: but not brown
[2:46:57] Diamon_Boots: There is 40K Ork lore where a mek creates "redder", a red so red it causes actual retinal damage
[2:47:00] FreedSpeaks: Rink
[2:47:04] Darrullo: wwhite isnt a light colour tho tom

[2:47:06] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: Hyper Red
[2:47:08] Arcanaut: Red^2
[2:47:10] YeMadScientist: red 2 is red plus red
[2:47:15] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 Were Norway was still its own country, but had less sway than Sweden and its king. But Norway still had its own people-representatatives (dunno what that is in english), and Norway slowly got more and more freedom until independence
[2:47:37] poglinthegoblin: Sorry just came back and first thing I hear is 'redtube, seeing is believing.'
[2:47:51] sugarstalker: red TWO
[2:47:54] Diamon_Boots: Me type bad
[2:47:58] sugarstalker: not tube. Very important difference
[2:48:04] power_corveus: @jimthegreen I thought they were saying redtube too
[2:48:04] Cindipool: You should get some freelance work translating for morlocs, Ben.
[2:48:06] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 So I would absolutely say that Norway was not a "part" of Sweden. Hope that clears things up a bit
[2:48:12] max_teflon: but is a car in red 2 color extra faster?
[2:48:17] greyecloak: @Diamon_boots Yeah but an Ork would just make any colour greener because GREEN IS BEST
[2:48:19] corpseemperorbiden: wasting your time with maths
[2:48:20] honklestein: Red 2 is cool and all, but Red 3 is coming this holiday season

[2:52:04] Cindipool: This sounds very healthy.
[2:52:09] tonytwocans: oh you mean like steak tartare
[2:52:10] sbuiko: that is beef tartar
[2:52:11] corpseemperorbiden: raw onion WutFace
[2:52:13] MahonsTV: @xenowolfram the rest I kinda agree on since the norwegians did create their own constitution after the napoleonic wars which then made sweden invade norway and force them into the union
[2:52:15] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: That sounds like the stuff you'd put into a pan to make a dish not a dish itself
[2:52:15] Frooba3: English 2: Attack of the Clones
[2:52:17] Swenee: Sounds great if you fry it
[2:52:17] Shanadir: ... is this one of Bens nightmares?
[2:52:19] Idunyken: wut
[2:52:21] Diamon_Boots: Onions WutFace
[2:52:21] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 Yeah, thats sorta the point of a union, making a stronger whole from two or more countries. Like the EU having trade tracts in common within. Im not saying Norway wasnt the weaker part of it here, they absolutely were, but there was never a lapse in Norways own government, meaning they were allways a country
[2:52:22] so_fanzy: mettigel
[2:52:22] greyecloak: That's just the starter of a good burger
[2:52:25] YeMadScientist: raw??
[2:52:27] Darrullo: @Yogscast are you sure its not a burger mix not been cooked since bread egg and onion is always in there
[2:52:27] SixTonTitan: Rawbeef / tartare beef, that is.
[2:52:30] Idunyken: bung it in the microwave at least, jfc
[2:52:30] iRobits: did they forget to cook it?
[2:52:33] Diamon_Boots: I really dislike onions
[2:52:34] YeMadScientist: surely its meant to be cooked
[2:52:35] vintagethecolorpurple: add ants to that and you've got a meal from Noma
[2:52:36] StenGun: umm, pass
[2:52:36] Gamoranin: that would be delicious cooked, like a meatloaf or something
[2:52:36] doddsian: Does sound very steak tartare-ish
[2:52:37] STIMP_TM: its called 'Mett Brötchen' in german
[2:52:37] drizzir_: steak tatar eastern europe style yes
[2:52:41] sbuiko: it's a delicacy, if done right
[2:52:41] Cindipool: "I think you forgot to cook this."
[2:52:46] CptKernow: tartarak
[2:52:54] SixTonTitan: @Yogscast That's steak tartare, that is
[2:52:55] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 They didnt invade though, they had a "peacefull" standoff at the border. No shots were fired
[2:52:56] AcenDread: yes
[2:53:00] sbuiko: needs some paprika
[2:53:04] tonytwocans: presentation benn
[2:53:05] proflix: sounds like aswurst (idk how to spell it)
[2:53:06] doddsian: Good quality beef, well seasoned
[2:53:08] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: You didn't not cook it right
[2:53:14] TK_Chubs: You only use the egg yolk, no egg white
[2:53:16] milson_o7: Tatarák
[2:53:16] derpeldore: @Crescentrune Don't be silly. That is physically impossible. yogSed
[2:53:21] corpseemperorbiden: you eat with your eyes
[2:53:24] SixTonTitan: Steak Tartare!
[2:53:30] celtickraken_: maybe you ate it wrong
[2:53:32] lupinosis: that meat is raw
[2:53:33] Mizzuru: wander lusting mama
[2:53:35] Darrullo: its shit steak tartare, and tartare is not a great food, its a dish to use scarps of ffillet meat thats cut off
[2:53:36] Ebethian: google "tatarák"
[2:53:38] tuftaf: Tatarák
[2:53:40] DangernoodleHotS: tatar
[2:53:42] MahonsTV: @xenowolfram it was still under swedish control is what I am trying to get at since sweden basically decided the foreign policies and could supercede norway
[2:53:42] warsnail2: it was a bad traslation and should be SNAKE Tartar
[2:53:49] doddsian: So the restaurant sounds like the problem
[2:53:56] vintagethecolorpurple: maybe the restaurant just forgot to cook it
[2:53:57] greyecloak: eugh that don't look good
[2:53:59] Frooba3: I think "Delicacy" is a word that means expensive, not tasty.
[2:54:00] DeM0nFiRe: WutFace
[2:54:02] sbuiko: told you it was done wrong
[2:54:05] drago_drake: that is uncooked
[2:54:07] StenGun: ready for cooking
[2:54:08] max_teflon: mett brötchen or handwerkermarmelade
[2:54:10] Idunyken: why would you not just cook that???
[2:54:11] dumlen: looks g-goo..d? YEP
[2:54:13] Qwaar_Jet_Khar: This sounds absolutely disgusting
[2:54:13] Wunderud: r/wewatnplates
[2:54:13] Idunyken: It would be so much better
[2:54:16] Qwaar_Jet_Khar: And I love meat
[2:54:16] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: It's called rustic presentation Tom
[2:54:17] doddsian: Guys raw beef similar to that is very common

[2:54:20] doddsian: can be very nice
[2:54:22] Cindipool: It sounds like a great way to get really sick.

[2:54:24] XanderOfBritain: its like that test thing Bedowin tribes play on people with the goats head
[2:54:25] miiiona: so bad!
[2:54:26] TrowellingBadger: Maybe they expected you to take it home and cook it yourself. So they just sat watching in astonishment as this weird foreigner ate a plate of raw ingredients.
[2:54:27] corpseemperorbiden: "its raw"-gordan ramsry
[2:54:32] TrueBlueOne: well made its tasting amazing
[2:54:32] xenowolfram: @Mahons12 Eh, lets just agree to disagree here. Fun talk though
[2:54:34] Qwaar_Jet_Khar: Just cook the fucking food and it would be amazing
[2:54:34] asbog1: just apply heat and its good
[2:54:34] Shanadir: anyone getting hungry?
[2:54:37] Diamon_Boots: Looks... Not 100% terrible, but easy to fuck up

[2:54:49] doddsian: Love steak tartare but yeah if it's done wrong it's grim
[2:54:53] tesmike: it's really not as bad as everyone here is making it out to be.
[2:54:53] Ebethian: you put the garlic on the bread, rub it hard
[2:54:55] drizzir_: garlic for the toasted bread LUL
[2:54:59] Darrullo: @MisterMaus you can get chicken sashimi
[2:55:00] Idunyken: just cook your meat

[2:55:13] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I'll happily have the onions raw, but cook the rest ffs
[2:55:14] lupinosis: yeah just cook your meat
[2:55:15] SixTonTitan: Steak tartare is a thing, but you NEED to prepare it properly or you're gonna have a bad time
[2:55:16] YeMadScientist: thats just a chef being lazy and not cooking the food
[2:55:20] blazinpsycho: I am a raw man, I will eat anything raw
[2:55:20] Wunderud: @Idunyken Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in toaster
[2:55:28] Sharpy_G: they literally go through all the effort to make it burger shaped and then don't grill it
[2:55:34] MisterMaus: @Darrullo sounds disgusting

[2:58:17] Frooba3: You have to cook em! you're a cannibal, not a monster
[2:58:18] Mizzuru: I ate 보신탕 without knowing it once
[2:58:28] KXT420: Jimmy Space?
[2:58:28] themightymastermax: Hellebrone would be the worst to eat
[2:58:29] tankboy60: with lewis
[2:58:30] DigitalHamWarrior: the worst think that I will eat is shitty gas station fried chicken
[2:58:31] MahonsTV: Japanese jimmy shouldn't be that hard to find Kappa
[2:58:33] power_corveus: Is Jimmy just lewis?
[2:58:41] SixTonTitan: @Cindipool That's beyond me, personally. But I mean, I can't imagine a lot of meat you buy has parasites in it and regulators have just gone "eh it's fine, people will cook 'em out".
[2:58:42] Darrullo: food is meant to be bland but pretty
[2:58:43] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru and how do you say that?
[2:58:46] iRobits: Instagramers are going to be a great source of rump steaks when the apocalypse happens
[2:58:50] Darrullo: in japan at least
[2:58:55] Evolutionmonkey: @jimthegreen only if you eat parts of the central nervous system muscles like legs and arms should be fine
[2:59:01] xenowolfram: @Yogscast That is complte bullshit
[2:59:03] Cindipool: @Essixian Well yes, but the risk is still there. Is it really worth it?
[2:59:04] Mizzuru: @Mahons12 보신탕 Bosintang
[2:59:19] SixTonTitan: @Cindipool Never had steak tartare, wouldn't know. :P
[2:59:22] PascusRex: sashimi
[2:59:23] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru ah thank you
[2:59:24] gecko_90: wut?
[2:59:27] Erk2048: Chicken sashimi
[2:59:27] PascusRex: you can have chicke nor whatever
[2:59:35] Shanadir: salmonella bites, yumm
[2:59:35] monkeybadger: Yeah its got a name: salmonella
[2:59:37] Idunyken: yogEw
[2:59:38] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: Yum!
[2:59:40] phreekedelic: one time before an exam I looked up the probability of supermarket chicken having salmonella to see if I could get ill before the exam.
[2:59:41] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru and what is it?
[2:59:44] vintagethecolorpurple: raw chicken is only unhealthy if it's from a slaughterhouse, if it's killed cleanly it's just gross
[2:59:44] Gelert: I'd eat that
[2:59:44] drago_drake: 'food poisoning' thats what its called
[2:59:44] tonytwocans: WutFace
[2:59:45] lupinosis: mmmm
[2:59:47] SvatyFini: what is cartlidge?
[2:59:47] goodadam: I had the chicken sashimi in Japan one time...
[2:59:49] Darrullo: sashimiof chicken, the way they do it is they boil the meat quickly to kill germs and cut away the cooked bit
[2:59:50] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: It's called slices of hospital visit.
[2:59:53] Wallis_L: no thanks
[2:59:56] Diamon_Boots: Raw untreated pufferfish TPFufun
[2:59:56] goodadam: Don't really recommed it
[2:59:56] celtickraken_: I've eaten raw chicken, just not on purpose
[2:59:59] blakmoor: nah i croonch the cartalige
[3:00:01] MathisFalg: That my friend, is called the dum tourist test
[3:00:01] Cindipool: Cartilidge is like body rubber.
[3:00:01] blazinpsycho: definitely not a lot of us Asians in chat
[3:00:02] Darrullo: joints
[3:00:02] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: Thanks japan
[3:00:02] proflix: I might puke :)
[3:00:03] MisterMaus: I ate moose meatballs once and the first bite was a big piece of cartilage
[3:00:06] Mizzuru: @Mahons12 Dog Stew
[3:00:07] Shanadir: eww....
[3:00:07] corpseemperorbiden: salmonella sooshime yum
[3:00:08] CptKernow: gristle
[3:00:10] SvatyFini: eh WutFace
[3:00:11] vintagethecolorpurple: it's your nose
[3:00:12] RoelKalero: its the crunchy good stuff
[3:00:13] SnugSalticidae: chicken scratchings? eww
[3:00:13] derpeldore: Humanity excelled after we figured out how to cook food. Hipsters can slather themselves in raw mutton and goosefat, but they are historically wrong. assP
[3:00:14] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru monkaS
[3:00:15] SixTonTitan: @SvatyFini What Tom said, it's what your nose and ears are made out of
[3:00:15] smurgledwerf: thanks...I'm not hungry anymore
[3:00:15] RuneyViolet: The japanese just have a way of making everything tasty.. what I found xD

[3:00:17] iRobits: your ears.
[3:00:18] Scuffler: Collagen protein is important though.
[3:00:20] blakmoor: its extra texture
[3:00:21] power_corveus: ...its delisious tho?
[3:00:21] Shanadir: I'm glad I'm not eating
[3:00:22] roblikeabank: softer than bone harder than flesh, talking about that ween
[3:00:25] PascusRex: well they also have raw beef and germans have raw pork
[3:00:25] H0lymike: yogPlague yogPlague yogPlague
[3:00:26] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: It's for making stock not nomming.
[3:00:28] ojomaze: I can't wait till we get lab grown chicken without cartilage
[3:00:28] davidiceblade44: the vaccinate their chickens
[3:00:28] Darrullo: its not that bad, and no its quickly seared to kill any germ
[3:00:28] max_teflon: aaah Knorpel, the stuff in your ears
[3:00:31] power_corveus: Oh wait raw, nevermind ECH
[3:00:33] YeMadScientist: if its super fresh raw meat is fine
[3:00:36] davidiceblade44: it doesn't get diseases
[3:00:40] Mizzuru: @Mahons12 this is why I gave the korean name... I will again clarify, unkowingly ate it
[3:00:46] blakmoor: do you not?
[3:00:55] Darrullo: i once had a sheeps cheese that was fermented in the sheeps bladder
[3:01:00] iRobits: there tasty
[3:01:00] blakmoor: naah
[3:01:03] drago_drake: wait, you should leave more than the bones?
[3:01:04] gecko_90: stop this is making me sad
[3:01:08] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: It's like a tasty after chicken mint
[3:01:08] blazinpsycho: I ordered chicken knees at restaurants :3 it's fried and cartiledgey....
[3:01:10] milson_o7: healthy tho
[3:01:12] nerdcave_justin: A buddy of mine eats the wing bones
[3:01:12] Darrullo: its a sardignian thing, also had maggot cheese
[3:01:12] power_corveus: EXTRA PROTEIN yogTODDY
[3:01:13] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: You don't eat the knobbly bits, that's just wrong
[3:01:13] STIMP_TM: in italy they fry little birds and eat them as whole
[3:01:16] loatroll: are we sure the chefs aren't hazing them for not being Japanese?
[3:01:17] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[3:01:22] rapter29: @yemadscientist doesn't matter how fresh it is if it carrying a foodborne illness.
[3:01:22] Dokga_: Isn't it because the quality is so good the risk of salmonella is extremely low
[3:01:23] Mizzuru: I've had fried chicken gizzard before
[3:01:24] corpseemperorbiden: always clean your chicken wings clean imo
[3:01:24] Dice2013: i know a lot of people that break the chicken bones and eat the marrow as well
[3:01:26] SixTonTitan: My sister's ex would suck the marrow out of bones whenever he had steak or anything like that, I couldn't get into it LUL
[3:01:26] blakmoor: its just a waste of good chockin
[3:01:30] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru I can understand when you do not know what something is and you eat it but I would guess you had a bit of a monkaS face when you knew what it was LUL
[3:01:39] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: People used to use all the bits of animals like chickens to make soup and stock etc
[3:01:41] Darrullo: @STIMP_TM that is france, they have a cloth over the head to hide their shame from god
[3:01:43] Diamon_Boots: Wait, you are supposed to leave hte bones?
[3:01:57] blazinpsycho: use everything! waste nothing!
[3:01:59] derpeldore: Oh, have you tried that japanese "konjaku" stuff? It's 97% water, 3% fermented herringbone. yogP
[3:02:12] goodadam: @loatroll For real, wasn't just for forigners, they were actually confused why we were not super into it, and munched away with us
[3:02:25] leinadryan: making stock from the parts is very good, but eating the cartilage?
[3:02:25] Darrullo: @Wolfangz kinda, but the risk is brought down massively by prep
[3:02:26] corpseemperorbiden: thats the way you do it
[3:02:29] power_corveus: I've done that before LUL
[3:02:30] STIMP_TM: @Darrullo Didn't know the frenchies do this too ... yogS
[3:02:30] XanderOfBritain: woooow
[3:02:32] blakmoor: thats a super power right there
[3:02:33] SixTonTitan: The most efficient chicken eater in the world.
[3:02:36] PascusRex: @Yogscast was this Kev from the old videos? man I miss that guy he was superchill
[3:02:39] scottycool_: @Phil_AKA_ThundyUK used to? pretty much all food has all the bits in these days if its processed
[3:02:41] john_marston_jr: pro chickenwing moves
[3:02:44] DanielTheWise: i want to be that man
[3:02:44] Mizzuru: @Mahons12 I had to poker face it. The cook was my (at the time) girlfriends dad, who was a professional chef. I just had to say it was delicious. I do not believe this was malicious he just didnt understand the faux fas of serving dog stew to a foreigner
[3:02:50] Frooba3: I wanna kiss that man
[3:02:50] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: That sounds like a fucking cartoon
[3:02:53] solidrile: he did that later
[3:02:58] Darrullo: @STIMP_TM its not a thing in italy as far as i know, its barely a french thing anymore
[3:03:06] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru that makes complete sense
[3:03:15] goodadam: @Mizzuru Thats kinda rough
[3:03:15] power_corveus: Well, who said you have to even spit out the bones
[3:03:16] rapter29: @mizzuru did it taste good tho?
[3:03:21] Diamon_Boots: I want chicken now...
[3:03:23] power_corveus: Free calcium right there, and Marrow!
[3:03:33] Wunderud: Hold them up at the gate?
[3:03:36] Dokga_: @Darrullo cus i know they use raw egg as a dipping sauce for some meals
[3:03:38] STIMP_TM: I know they do it in Italy but it's illegal to catch the birds in most places
[3:03:41] Darrullo: @STIMP_TM pretty sure its illegal, its not any specific bird, its a bird you go out and shoot then eat the whole thing guts, beak, bones and all
[3:03:45] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru So... -was- it delicious? Kappa
[3:03:48] power_corveus: o/
[3:03:48] STIMP_TM: ^^
[3:03:50] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: This is the reason why I have a strong belief that humans should always eat in private
[3:03:51] JaffaMod: We're now going for an ad break that will last up to 5 minutes. Make sure you subscribe ( twitch.tv/yogscast/subscribe ) to not see them anymore!
[3:04:06] Shanadir: as long as you don't let them open the gates. that cav could be bad
[3:04:20] power_corveus: Imma dip during the break. I need my afternoon nap. Bye chat yogHey
[3:04:22] SixTonTitan: This music wants to make me grab a sword and fight for realm and lord SirSword tomatoYell
[3:04:30] MahonsTV: @Shanadir they can still break the gate with their cav
[3:04:34] Frooba3: Alright, I'm too invested in the stream, but I gotta do the work stuff. See you all later! Love you chat! yogLove
[3:04:34] Darrullo: @Wolfangz egg is much less likely to halve salmonella, salmonella is from old grain, the most common way to get it in humans is actually old rice
[3:04:35] Mizzuru: @Mahons12 @goodadam @rapter29 @Essixian I will clarify, dog, or at least the dog used in 보신탕, is not great meat. Its like very lean and gamey pork. Not recommended. what was extra weird is that it is good for 'male stamina' and he then sent me off with his daughter to their summer villa alone...
[3:04:54] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru Oh boy KEKW
[3:04:57] Mizzuru: andf he was pretty traditional
[3:05:01] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru LUL
[3:05:05] Mizzuru: so I dont know why he did that
[3:05:05] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru I feel for you, man.
[3:05:10] rapter29: @mizzuru LUL
[3:05:22] rapter29: I know why
[3:05:30] Darrullo: @Wolfangz also quail egg is oft used since it doesnt get salmonella, thats why in steak tartare its a tiny quail egg its not pretentious its safer
[3:05:35] derpeldore: Pretty much all medieval foods are pretty grim. Anybody want a "stargazing mackrel" pie? LUL
[3:05:40] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru Not to put a too fine point on it, I think he wanted you to get him a couple of grandkids.
[3:06:04] Mizzuru: @Essixian Which was not what 23 year old me was down for
[3:06:14] Dokga_: @Darrullo I'm learning a lot more on a sexy warhammer stream then i thought i would
[3:06:17] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[3:06:29] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru and he probably wanted you to either stay or just bone his daughter and then leave LUL
[3:06:30] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru Culture clashes, eh. Hope you get along better now though!
[3:06:38] Mizzuru: I will clarify also that my advice is always just try and eat everything you get given. I ate a lot of stuff in Korea and liked/loved most of it.
[3:06:44] Darrullo: @derpeldore not a bad food tbf the heads just are weird to look at, old food is hit and miss but not as bad as you would think
[3:07:04] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: People are free to eat whatever disgusting crap they want, but they should do it off by themselves where everyone else doesn't have to see, hear or smell it
[3:07:04] Darrullo: @Wolfangz hey if food talk comes up i speak, its my degree
[3:07:14] MahonsTV: @Mizzuru yeah always try something at the least once and then you know if you like it or not LUL
[3:07:22] Mizzuru: @Essixian hahaha well we broke up so no, but he hwas a chill dude. Now I date a woman from a different ethnicity with a whole bunch of new fun pitfalls
[3:07:44] SixTonTitan: @RufusOmega Fascist! I'll munch on my rat burger in the middle of the street if I feel like it. Kappa
[3:07:46] derpeldore: I would describe a lot of it as "bland and bony" @Darrullo
[3:07:47] Mizzuru: @Mahons12 the only thing I ate in Korea that I did not like was silk worms and I was there for 2 and a bit years and not conservative.
[3:07:52] goodadam: @Mizzuru I gotta agree with the 'just try everything' approach to food
[3:08:38] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru Sorry to hear, but good luck to you with the new lady! Here's hoping you can avoid dog flesh.
[3:08:40] Cindipool: I'm firmly in the "don't eat anything you're not sure about" camp, but I have a chronic health issue that makes a more cavalier attitude suicidal.
[3:08:58] Darrullo: @derpeldore yeah definatly blander but some looks good, check out a channel on youtube called tasting history guy goes over the food and its history before eating it
[3:09:00] MahonsTV: @Cindipool makes sense
[3:09:03] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: @Essixian Actually, rat burger would be fine. By the time you minced up the meat and added spices nobody can really tell what it was in the first place anyway
[3:09:06] SixTonTitan: @Cindipool Hope you're doing well. <3
[3:09:09] TheFrozenFlame_05: Did warhammer end, or is it just, a break?
[3:09:17] Mizzuru: break
[3:09:18] MahonsTV: @TheMarvelLegoMaster_05 break
[3:09:21] canthaveanycookies: break
[3:09:25] goodadam: I was served pureed Jelly Fish in a fancy Japanese business dinner, and it tasted like nothing, but the texture was horrid
[3:09:27] TheFrozenFlame_05: ok good
[3:09:30] TheFrozenFlame_05: thanks
[3:09:31] Cindipool: I have been outside... five times since March.
[3:09:38] Cindipool: So yeah, I'm doing just dandy.
[3:09:38] Mizzuru: I lke Jellyfish its nice!
[3:09:39] SixTonTitan: @RufusOmega True, but when I say rat burger I mean that I want you to be able to tell it's a rat burger. KEKW
[3:09:49] Mizzuru: Also, pigs feet, guys. we are missing out as a culture
[3:09:54] Mizzuru: pugs feet is the shit
[3:09:57] Mizzuru: pig
[3:10:02] goodadam: @Cindipool My little sister is in the same camp <3
[3:10:18] TheFrozenFlame_05: @Mizzuru I hope you aren't eating pug feet.
[3:10:21] SixTonTitan: @goodadam Isn't that just jellyfish someone's jumped up and down on a bit
[3:10:37] Darrullo: @Mizzuru mmm pug foot dee-lish... but yeah trotters are gud stock and can be good,tonkotsu broth
[3:10:41] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru My granddad -loved- pig feet, never tried them myself.
[3:10:43] derpeldore: Pigs feet literally died in europe. It used to be everywhere pigs were.
[3:10:48] Mizzuru: a good soy and ginger glaze on a pigs feet and then you slow roast that shit, slice it up and serve with raw garlic on the side. Maybe an extra order of cold spicy buckwheat noodles
[3:10:48] Darrullo: marrowbones rock do
[3:10:55] doddsian: pureeing jellyfish seems a little redundant lol
[3:11:13] Mizzuru: and a lot of makgoli
[3:11:16] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[3:11:25] Darrullo: @derpeldore you can still easily get them in uk, supermarket sells them, they are marketed for stock of course
[3:11:30] SixTonTitan: There can't be a lot of meat on pigs' feet though, is there?
[3:11:41] goodadam: @Essixian Me and my friend were picking at it, like "uh god better eat it don't want to make a sceen" Then we noticed non of the guys from the other company were eating it, just pushing the tray to the side and it was like "THANK GOODNESS"
[3:11:47] Darrullo: more than youd think
[3:11:51] Mizzuru: @Essixian theres a lot, it gets fattier as you get down to the hoof but there is a lot
[3:11:54] RoelKalero: pickled beef or buffalo tongue sliced up thin on a sandwich sooooo good
[3:12:24] Mizzuru: A lot of UK pigs feet get shipped to place like jamaica where it is more commonly eaten
[3:12:28] TheFrozenFlame_05: Best Merch --->
[3:12:30] Darrullo: tongue is another great meat, its super tasty and very lean
[3:12:31] goodadam: @Mizzuru I'd try that for sure
[3:12:42] SixTonTitan: @Mizzuru How much would you say there is compare to, say... a chicken drumstick?
[3:13:08] Darrullo: probably more @Essixian
[3:13:12] Mizzuru: @Essixian 4-5 times the amount
[3:13:18] derpeldore: I'm a man of a limited Norwegian pallete. If you can't make it work with brown sauce, it's bulshit and I hate it. yogWTF
[3:13:25] SixTonTitan: Really? Damn. Might have to try it.
[3:13:37] scottycool_: you know whats tasty, anything that wasnt a living animal
[3:13:38] Darrullo: best scrap food though is pigs blood black pudding
[3:13:51] DJmonkey64: wagyu beef
[3:13:54] DJmonkey64: good stuff
[3:13:54] RoelKalero: i also like chickens feet but so much work for so little
[3:13:58] Mizzuru: for all interested in Pigs Feet - the Korean dish is called 족발 Jokbal. some Korean restaurants in the UK do serve it, if anyone wants to know a place in London, ive got one
[3:13:58] Darrullo: black pudding is great and does not deserve the hate
[3:14:00] stringofhearts: Black pudding is the best!
[3:14:18] stringofhearts: Perfect addition to a full breakfast
[3:14:34] SixTonTitan: I've never liked black pudding. Granted, my first and so far only experience with black pudding has been in school lunches, which I can only imagine to be absolute bottom-of-the-barrel quality.
[3:14:42] Mizzuru: @Darrullo Koreans also have black pudding called soondae which instead of bread has rice noodles in it and is steamed and often served in a rich soup
[3:15:11] Darrullo: haggis and black pudding if not fried in lots of oil are so healthy in comparison to other "frying" meats i love how filling it is when on a diet, the kcal is so low for the amount
[3:15:21] SixTonTitan: Game of Bens yogBog
[3:15:28] Cindipool: Game of game of game of game of game of...
[3:15:37] Mizzuru: @Darrullo for sure, blood is just straight protein!
[3:15:40] goodadam: @Essixian I've never had a school meal that was a good example of anything except a way not to starve
[3:15:42] CptKernow: 11mins!
[3:15:48] chromekard: Tom using alt or ctrl you can strech a unit out on the wall to cover two towers
[3:15:54] RoelKalero: i have had like a blood jello in hot pot it was very good
[3:15:55] Darrullo: @Mizzuru tbf ive never had black pudding with bread in it? usually a bit of fat or sometimes barley

[3:16:22] corpseemperorbiden: after dark Kreygasm
[3:16:29] Darrullo: thing is black pud tasted so good coz the spices so im sure korean one is very different
[3:16:35] SixTonTitan: @goodadam I've had mostly okay to good school lunches, it's not -that- awful here in Sweden. There were some definite stinkers though, black pudding among them. Even though I don't eat it, I could just TELL it was terrible quality.
[3:16:43] brzoskwiniozierski: Tom!
[3:16:43] Darrullo: mace and clove and allspice classic uk spices
[3:16:58] Mizzuru: @Darrullo they all do, they have breadcrumbs or rusk added to the mix to hold it all together, like normal sausages but more becuase of it being more liquidy
[3:17:07] Diamon_Boots: Cav blobs sound like a very bad idea
[3:17:37] derpeldore: @Darrullo are you sure you're not just one of those mega-Omnivores? One of those that " see the charm" with red-beet cake? yogC
[3:17:47] Cindipool: A cunning strategem.
[3:17:48] SixTonTitan: Speaking of cav blobs: anyone here ever had horse? It's not bad.
[3:18:04] Darrullo: @Mizzuru yeah rusk is used more here but you can get it without either, its steamed into the skin to take solid shape
[3:18:12] Diamon_Boots: Fire arrows? Terrible
[3:18:31] thorzimeron: gate bug
[3:18:39] Cindipool: Gates are weird.
[3:18:52] Cindipool: Lizard gates are horrible and I hate them.
[3:19:00] derpeldore: Horse is meh. Tastes like beef that's been rolled in untreated rubber with a whif of sugar.
[3:19:21] reformedocelot: golden ratio is the spiral thing isn't it ?
[3:19:23] thorzimeron: bloody neoplatonists
[3:19:24] SixTonTitan: @Diamon_boots They can be useful, at least in multiplayer. Peasants with fire arrows are a very cost-effective choice against Tomb Kings, trolls, anything with regen really.
[3:19:28] Darrullo: @derpeldore i love red velvet only choco cake i like really, and im up to try anything im a chef after all, but i am very fussy not over flavour but quality of the dish and its prep
[3:19:31] brzoskwiniozierski: Ben has the golden ratio
[3:19:33] MegasDiadochi: toms is all hidden by beard
[3:19:38] Aadam78692: Yeah you need a spiral shaped head to be beautiful
[3:19:41] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: Tom's face is the antithesis to the golden ratio
[3:19:47] pastabus_: it used to be
[3:19:50] antibrine4545: botox is plastic
[3:19:52] sbuiko: it's plasticism
[3:19:55] PascusRex: to plasticize is to form
[3:20:01] Darrullo: probs comes from when they used plastic to make fake faces post ww1?
[3:20:02] jynslnk: plastic ratio
[3:20:03] Jupiter_Joe: yeah, lots of fillers now
[3:20:03] blazinpsycho: rhinoplasty? maybe bastardization of the term?
[3:20:03] brzoskwiniozierski: polymerisation
[3:20:04] MegasDiadochi: @bedgars because it turns you into plastic
[3:20:05] goodadam: @Essixian We never even got public school lunches in Canada, it was only when I was an University exchange student in Greece that I ate on campus regularly
[3:20:07] Rshiel_: Botox is a neurotoxin
[3:20:08] CptKernow: its from the greek
[3:20:19] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: because if you have too much you end up looking like a Barbie doll
[3:20:22] Aadam78692: Plastic is from the greek word plastikē meaning modelling or something
[3:20:23] Khazaar: Its Racist against Cosmetics!
[3:20:24] Ex_Libris85: didn't they call it plastic surgery because from greek the word means to shape or to mold?
[3:20:30] Hochdorff: plastic = formable, malleable
[3:20:30] CptKernow: from the greek for malleable
[3:20:30] Darrullo: @antibrine4545 botox is rat poison
[3:20:36] Cindipool: Ceramic surgery is sturdier, but less flexible.
[3:20:44] brzoskwiniozierski: I identify as 5% PET
[3:20:51] Darrullo: @antibrine4545 or some kind of poison anyway
[3:20:57] CptKernow: i had plastic surgery after getting hit by a baseball
[3:20:57] PascusRex: to plasticize means to form
[3:21:07] Rshiel_: And too much symmetry just looks uncannily, well, plastic, I think
[3:21:16] TrowellingBadger: Also why plastics are divided into thermosetting plastics and thermoplastic plastics

[3:21:25] pastabus_: he had a ceramic jaw
[3:21:34] XanderOfBritain: fun fact, cosmetic surgury has existed since before recorded history
[3:21:38] lozzzz: the 3 little pigs of plastic surgery
[3:21:39] derpeldore: @Darrullo nah, red velvet is crushed bugs, and really yummy. Red beet cake is frozen sludge from mashed red beets. yogGasm
[3:21:55] Cindipool: Tom, do you remember that game with the doll maker?
[3:21:57] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: Just wear a mask like Leonardo decaprio
[3:22:37] Darrullo: @derpeldore you are referring to cocheneal a beetle used to make a red food colour, traditional red velvet is a red beetroot chocolate cake with buttercream icing
[3:22:38] goodadam: @XanderOfBritain its hard to imagine wanting plastic surgury before anesthetic was invented, but I'd belive it
[3:22:48] Diamon_Boots: Bork bork borking onheaven's door
[3:22:52] reformedocelot: those peasants are so eager to kill the knights so they can earn a promotion
[3:22:53] Swenee: ow, that general gets hit alot
[3:22:59] brzoskwiniozierski: no
[3:23:01] MillenniumKing: But Waterworld ISNT terrible!
[3:23:18] Darrullo: @goodadam one word... opiates
[3:23:20] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: Waterworld rocks and so does The Postman
[3:23:26] anxiouduck: finally watched waterworld the other day, genuinely enjoyed it after Tom's various ravings
[3:23:30] Shanadir: did you ever play the waterworld game though?
[3:23:31] blazinpsycho: Postman!!!
[3:23:31] Thjumus: Did audio cut out for a few secs for anyone else?
[3:23:36] astro570: I really enjoyed postman too, lol

[3:23:53] Dream146: Street fighter movie is un-ironically one of my favourite films
[3:23:55] Paulser: I watch Tom & Ben and i know it .........
[3:24:01] Xaoses: Hey guys, I just got into Warhammer around a week ago, after years of Rome II, do you two have any tips?
[3:24:02] XanderOfBritain: @goodadam Neandertal trepaning is a terrifying prospect
[3:24:04] RuneyViolet: Chaos gods did not approve
[3:24:09] gecko_90: world is 99% water every 1 dirty LUL
[3:24:16] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Waterworld is a good and fun film. People think it must be bad because it lost loads of money, but that's only because they spent so much making it
[3:24:18] MegasDiadochi: tenet is worth watching multiple times
[3:24:18] crabknight49: The new star warsmovies have theopposite effect theyre supposed to be good but welp
[3:24:26] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: Anyone also see Mr Brooks? That's a great Kostner film.
[3:24:33] brzoskwiniozierski: I like the big boat in water world
[3:24:39] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: Costner*
[3:24:40] goodadam: @Darrullo @XanderOfBritain I suppose thats right there have always been ways of getting high as shit courtesy of nature

[3:24:41] bobsickle2: They let them inside?
[3:24:55] brzoskwiniozierski: and the guy in the dinghy in the oil
[3:24:56] bobsickle2: Forts are easymode because of the towers
[3:24:57] Cindipool: They couldn't really stop them getting inside.
[3:25:08] MillenniumKing: YOU GOT THE TOUCH
[3:25:13] MillenniumKing: YOU GOT THE POWERRRRRR
[3:25:22] iRobits: @cindipool giggidy
[3:25:33] CptKernow: the soundtrack is ace
[3:25:35] Paulser: @XanderOfBritain If you plays Rome 2 you be fine with Warhammer there a little more crazy spells that it really
[3:25:37] TrowellingBadger: Don't know why you needed to specify 1986 there, Ben. There haven't been any other Transformers movie...
[3:25:40] DariusHasDogs: yeah the animation in it starts off amazing
[3:25:42] bobsickle2: Beyond tier 2, forts battles are impossible to lose
[3:25:59] Phil_AKA_ThundyUK: Oscars are done mate. They're such a virtue signalling piece of SHIT now.
[3:26:00] DarkSnideOfTheRainbow: The oscars are a hollywood circle jerk
[3:26:01] englishturdd: Tom how come you don't do TTT anymore?
[3:26:01] pastabus_: the academy is so full of shit it's coming out their ears
[3:26:07] AbsoluteMarshmallow: awards are bought not earned in Hollywood
[3:26:08] derpeldore: @Darrullo ah, I wasn't aware there where multiple red beet cakes, sorry. The specific one I'm refering to is made with freezing a mixture of pulpted red beets overnight. It tastes like flavoured dirt. bedgarLUL
[3:26:09] Scuffler: Oscars are all bought.
[3:26:11] Diamon_Boots: Some awards are good, but a lot are bad
[3:26:12] XanderOfBritain: @Paulser did uh, did you tag the wrong person?
[3:26:13] DigitalHamWarrior: academy awards are just a bunch of rich assholes jerking each other off
[3:26:14] blazinpsycho: the Grand Budapest hotel! only oscar movie I enjoyed

[3:27:33] Cindipool: Narrative play :D
[3:27:36] DeadlyNeuro: @dank_astley He stepped away because he wanted to let new people play more often and they normally record in the morning which he couldnt be bothered with
[3:27:49] Darrullo: @derpeldore oh im not aware of that but beets are the old timey source of sugar so makes sense. but also you may have had a bad version, alot of especially old recipes are a guideline that are telling method and core amoutns and it was up to you to add the flavour and niceties
[3:27:59] Diamon_Boots: So like... 6 planes?
[3:28:14] jg108a: origin stories
