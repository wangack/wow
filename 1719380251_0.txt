[0:49:27] n0n4m3_001: There's a lot of desync in this game, so even if you see a suspicous situation you can truly say that this person is cheating.. The game design and flaws makes the player question what's legitimate and what's not.
[0:49:29] Aerostorm_: @L0RD9 camera recoil is different from the gun recoil

[0:50:57] focuss: @Poke13x they added hardcore to apesex legends?

[0:51:59] zyronn: audio in tarky is so bad
[0:52:01] zyronn: its painful
[0:52:02] itzBlaZn: If they were influenced by the vid, it's refreshing to have devs listening to the community
[0:52:03] Vellety: tomorrow might be the save
[0:52:09] ArturoGJ: Not anymore
[0:52:10] randyblackson: i can hear people in bunker on reserve, at helicopter

[0:52:27] AikO_live: @higgiepop I was hyped when they showed for the first time. But it's Sadge
[0:52:29] Aerostorm_: something like pre-baked path traced sound would be best
[0:52:33] IrishC: true, you shouldnt be able to hear someone sprinting in 3 story from 2 story

[0:52:45] SomeKidsHamster: I like how quiet pubg audio is
[0:52:49] blondeb0nzai: What‚Äôs with getting shot and not hearing a sound?  Happened a few times
[0:52:54] OmegaTooYew: wideVIBE
[0:52:56] Igelkotte: sound should be louder if you have more gear
[0:52:56] streetskiper: they should get rid of the headset in general, or it should only amplify the sound by no more than 20 %
[0:52:57] Bakuano: thats how it used to work, its just a bug making crouch walk loud
[0:52:59] MFBainn: maybe if you are overweight and walking
[0:53:03] FadeIntoNeon: but there's also skills that attribute to hearing to consider @shroud

[0:53:24] Chromadrakon: pretty sure you cant nerd LOL
[0:53:25] General_HAM: Everyone satisfied with the recoil changes?
[0:53:26] CaseyyRichards: its like the gun parts are lose
[0:53:29] Brendo______: The ADS sound is BS
[0:53:30] toastbusta: make a slider for slow ads
[0:53:31] ShaddyDaShadow: If you are in covert movement it should be slower ads but quiet @shroud
[0:53:31] steelwolve: maybe a quiet slow ads
[0:53:31] Counterxap: make a slow option that doesnt make a sound

[0:53:41] xxOrbits: why can i not get into a scav game
[0:53:42] hikka27: anti-rat noise
[0:53:45] Jimbagg: Agreed, I always thought the ads clicking noise was weird
[0:53:49] h01yghost: its crazy their idea of "realism" is extremely unrealistic
[0:53:50] MastaKlutch: shroud know how game should be
[0:53:50] Chromadrakon: @CaseyyRichards because they do rattle in real life or they would snap.

[0:54:00] itsjawji: SeemsGood
[0:54:01] X3ji: no
[0:54:02] chumppi: Slow ADS could be a thing, like one or two second ADS?
[0:54:03] noisefix: The ads noise sounds like you have a charm raddling around on your gun
[0:54:03] TheProjectDestiny: Well then it shouldn't make noice taking it down cause u won't slam it down either
[0:54:04] ShaddyDaShadow: sure Kappa
[0:54:05] Dr3shy: just alt + w for silent unscope

[1:30:42] Jessitivity: rush them at ruaf
[1:30:43] liverhead: @unlegit_tv itll be fine its the cpu you need
[1:30:44] M0N_S0N: @coreymac recoil was bugged came from the grip and not from the stock meaning the Gun¬¥s rotated upwards like crazy

[1:31:12] 7he_Batman: @unlegit_tv Nah, the game terribly optimized and doesn't utilize GPUs correctly. CPU matters a bit more currently
[1:31:14] bloodlinex71: pinch both sides bruh
[1:31:17] Groovytz: I cant run this game higher than 100fps with my 3080 KEKW
[1:31:17] deathwush: @coreymac thats still the case tho, just waaay less noticable
[1:31:20] xMesekerx: @unlegit_tv Its a cpu game, 1080 is fine for this
[1:31:25] haruyoshi7: chat, what he's using to show the fps ?
[1:31:31] candyznuts: @Taylorss this game is about cpu lil bro
[1:31:37] KontrolStyle: console fps 1 i think

[1:31:44] I_Devious_I: @haruyoshi7 set a keybind for your console and type fps 1
[1:31:50] turntablist_mk2: @dechyper just watched Lvndmark use it for 3 raids, not that good as he agress. but it is viable now
[1:31:51] TomPilot: 5800x3d best CPU for this game. Pair it with a 1080 and you'll still get 120 frames lol. game doesnt utilize high end gpus

[1:32:22] xMesekerx: I got 13700k and 3080 and all maps are 160fps+. When I had 6700k and 3080 everything was 70fps. Definitely cpu game
[1:32:30] candyznuts: @Taylorss ram doesnt do shit,
[1:32:37] M0N_S0N: @unlegit_tv Ram is more important than cpu tbh. i have 32 gigs and this game uses 20+ most of the time
[1:32:37] randyblackson: you need ram too. 32 at least, 16 isn‚Äôt optimal for this game anymore
[1:32:38] Shakeron: @shroud there will be patch in 7h with even more side recoil buffs
[1:32:40] kirkoswald30: yeah cpu most import
[1:32:42] randyblackson: @candyznuts lol

[1:33:07] xMesekerx: @TheSharpie nope, dlss makes the game look like shit and doesnt change performance
[1:33:07] b3qns: @Taylorss its about hard drive space cause the game swaps memory
[1:33:14] MastaKlutch: those boxes looked like a big scaled iridium

[1:33:28] strucky_: gain like 30gps
[1:33:28] creativityx: @CarlosRovai turn textures to medium...
[1:33:29] Sweepityy: @Taylorss i play with a rtx 2060 and a ryzen 5 3600 with 16gb ram, i run streets fine tbh but "fine" can be subjective i guess lol

[1:35:52] savory_bacon: @Taylorss thats what ive heard, but then people say they have worse components with same RAM and it runs "fine" ???
[1:35:55] Deatride: definitely need at least 32gb. friend has a mid tier pc and changed his ram and said it was a bit smoother from 16gb
[1:35:55] ElderKamiGuru: 33 hours n I get the Bitcoin farm. I hear it's not worth but idc
[1:35:56] MastaKlutch: @TheProjectDestiny yeah but for tarkov you need a better cpu, and 32 gb of ram for max potential in frames

[2:17:18] King_Grey_: Honest truth: Shroud is a god  at FPS games, hence the viewership. Shroud is just another random MMO player. Its just button mashing with a group of people. Those streamers HAVE to interact with their audience.
[2:17:18] vrtualgrlfriend: only one way to find out
[2:17:19] bf_samael96: you wouldn't get people cause watching MMOs is boring as shit

[2:17:27] theJoel: you have to be a very entertaining personality as mmos are more laid back and slower. that is why asmon is so popular
[2:17:32] joey_money: those early New World streams were bangers
[2:17:33] Under_Growth: MMO Audiences are also very split between each MMO, they don't tend to cross watch between them
[2:17:34] silverluna80: If i like women, does that make me a lesbian?
[2:17:38] Tyrine: you're already financially secure, whats the harm in pivoting your content?

[2:48:22] Tabneto: if he was using a shotgun he shouldnt be hitting the head, especially against a super armored dude
[2:48:30] krypp91: stm9, no sight and no iron sight either, hitting headshots without ironsight is a challenge

[2:48:48] JaxuHully: @shroud He was using 9x19 GT bullets where the pen is only 14, so a face shield blocks those most of the times.

[3:05:51] JaxuHully: @lighthandler Also when you play as a scav and high scar reputation, bosses wont aggro on you, you can spawn with better items/gear/ammo/guns and extract with said stuff etc. As a PMC vehicle extracts also cost less money

[3:43:04] 7heres4Way: oh fail on the chain spawn
[3:43:04] ChubbyMikey: @Boone696 I'm not an addon guy myself, but after he got hekili I tried that and lost 30% of my DPS, so if you're maining Devestation evoker, maybe don't use yet
[3:43:10] 7heres4Way: that makes more sense
[3:44:01] Jcerg99: hi
[3:44:01] ChubbyMikey: wait, didn't prot just take a hit on the balance changes @Boone696
