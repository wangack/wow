[0:38:53] pigbenls: @MonzyGames What exactly constitutes a ‚Äúgold bid‚Äù or GDKP raid?  We‚Äôre defining GDKP as any raid or dungeon run where items are awarded in exchange for gold. Please note that we have multiple detection methods for GDKP that are effective both inside and outside of dungeon or raid instances.  directly from blizzard blue post. I suggest you reread it buddy

[2:03:35] Rakullez: Hello there Guzu
[2:03:37] LillaJeon: Def use them late levels @Guzu They are 20% rested xp no matter level. So high level = higher exp value HahaThink
[2:04:18] Tropicocity: DinkDonk IMBUES
[2:04:23] PRazmogh: its 20% and 20% is higher absolute value at higher levels
[2:04:34] Lightbringer2001: @PRazmogh Math is mathing right here
[2:04:44] serginhofilipe: take the belt for ele
[2:04:45] serginhofilipe: no1 needs
[2:04:56] ScootSmith: Morning Guzu! Morning Chat! wave
[2:04:59] Millenlol: Mobs and quests are also worth more at higher levels, pretty sure it doesnt really matter when you use it
[2:05:05] adam_brisbane: dont do the harvester it is a nightmare
[2:05:05] Smooo07: go to TB and let the guy with pearl drop buff
[2:05:06] captainblom: @3Brick_ nah that was the guy that kept undercutting us XD
[2:05:14] Tropicocity: @PRazmogh but dont the fodder have a cooldown to use?
[2:05:16] CamGG__: nice run folks
[2:05:17] Jack_kgbeast: lets go farm RFK
[2:05:22] Horfent: Guzu perhaps do the sleeping bag quest for those rested xp student fodder?
[2:05:26] Smooo07: oh
[2:05:29] Smooo07: do it
[2:05:54] flowerpew: @GUzu iAsk do u think they should buff quest XP so people dont' spam dungeons in p3 ?
[2:05:54] Smooo07: please no dungeon spamming guzuY
[2:06:12] Tropicocity: they wont
[2:06:18] piperboi: dont nerf just buff
[2:06:20] Vesir_1: need more layers to make questing better
[2:06:20] Smooo07: peepoAngy
[2:06:20] Tropicocity: they definitely wont nerf dungeon xp lol
[2:06:21] assasinatorbg: i believe it's better to make dungeons like in harcore
[2:06:21] Donnie_ofc: why would you prevent peopel from dungeon spamming?
[2:06:21] Blufootgaming: id just quit
[2:06:22] Millenlol: People will spam dungeons anyways, you can't quest early on, there's too many people fighting for the low spawn rate mobs
[2:06:27] Dreamscythe: People angry in wow? no way
[2:06:27] arteyb00m: we used to farm SM in vanilla
[2:06:30] A_Cold_0ne: just buff quest xp
[2:06:31] arteyb00m: it makes no difference
[2:06:32] FroSoCold: its always 4 bars of rested XP per fodder btw so starting at 37 is the best way to do it
[2:06:33] kiinoo: buff quests
[2:06:33] ScootSmith: they cant force people to play the game a certain way, it wouldnt be wow if they did that imo
[2:06:35] mordiell: people will be angry no matter what
[2:06:38] 3Brick_: @Guzu i feel like they should add a lock out so you can do only like 5 of the same dungeon
[2:06:41] Fat_Toli: its not about the xp, it was impossible to quest at the start of p2
[2:06:47] Blufootgaming: buffing quest xp is okay, but actively making levelling worse is a deal breaker
[2:06:51] Faded_Funk: @Fat_Toli This
[2:06:54] Tropicocity: @mordiell peepoHey
[2:07:00] Millenlol: Has nothing to do with the exp from quests, dungeons have mobs available, world does not
[2:07:01] mordiell: @Tropicocity peepoHey
[2:07:03] Dreamscythe: @mordiell Hey Mordi /tickle cohhYay cohhYay
[2:07:06] captainblom: questing is way more fun in my opinion XD
[2:07:06] wwombology: Why nerf dungeons xp? Let people play the way they want
[2:07:07] Merixx29: 30 layers have fun with mob tag
[2:07:08] bubbleznchaos: i find open world more enjoyable
[2:07:13] Merixx29: sp/boom op level
[2:07:18] SippinSimpSyrup: Its more xp and its easier overall to do dungeons
[2:07:19] Djinx_o: zero people in the open world now
[2:07:20] Smooo07: im always peepoAngy
[2:07:23] Donnie_ofc: dungeon spamming was a part of vanilla so why not? if people like doing it, then go for it
[2:07:23] swayindamorn: problem is on phase launch, Quests are over run for the first 1-2 weeks
[2:07:27] flowerpew: good mixture omE spams SM for 2 days
[2:07:30] Kinghorn: questing on my server was impossible the first week
[2:07:36] mordiell: @Dreamscythe hello peepoHug guzuL
[2:07:39] TheClane: game is dead in open world
[2:07:40] Guzumerchmanager: what about spamming some pogchamps ?
[2:07:40] TheClane: DEAD
[2:07:41] Zecxx: dungeon spams are nice cuz u cant get fked over by flooded questing areas
[2:07:43] winged_kitten: $cookie
[2:07:43] sickymalo: no guzu that logic is too sound
[2:07:43] Supibot: winged_kitten, Your daily cookie: To forgive others one more time is to create one more blessing for yourself.
[2:07:44] Blufootgaming: my good mix is 2 hours of prequesting then 20 hours of ZF
[2:07:45] assasinatorbg: the game is designed so 20 % of the population is doing 25 - 40 not 80 % so it will get even worse next phases
[2:07:45] 3Brick_: @Guzu i feel like they should add a lock out so you can do only like 5 of the same dungeon Û†ÄÄ
[2:07:45] LillaJeon: They put so many layers now that the open world is deadge
[2:07:48] ATcaribou: thats what i did on my warrior. it kept it from being boring, but it was definitely slower than dungeon spamming
[2:07:50] gressil1234: you can't quest in PvP servers past 25
[2:07:51] 21bender21: WTB more sm spam
[2:08:00] zachmann: I love questing in STV (PvE Server) otherwise I did dungeos
[2:08:04] emikochan13: i did a mixture and it was a lot of fun

[2:09:01] dolesy20: Went hard with dungeon spam on P2 release and the same group of guildies decided to take a random pug over me because I was home 20 minutes late because of work and got left behind

[2:09:28] rpl_1337: I recently went back to HC and there are a lot of people on those servers
[2:09:33] Shreddingly: ssf is just hc without the streamer benefits experience

[2:10:08] Smooo07: SSF is much more challenging = more fun and more glory hitting 60
[2:10:29] mordiell: @Smooo07 people will still mob tag
[2:10:30] Smooo07: flip oooooooooh
[2:10:30] emikochan13: @Smooo07 nothing stopping people doing it solo
[2:10:39] fetza108: @fetza_twitch oh i see now on youtube thanks. i never heard that mod lol
[2:10:43] gatshaman: you dont need to pick that quest
[2:10:51] Muri_San: you won't be able to do the harvester anyway, spawn time is atrocious
[2:10:53] TheWhiteRabbitxX: SF is a self imposed challenge that is only meaningful to the person doing it. if people cheat they‚Äôre just cheating themselves. makes no sense
[2:10:59] DamDamPew: @mordiell warrior challenge for SF hc ?
[2:11:07] Smooo07: mordiell well if they wanna do it its whatever, but it feels much better hitting 60 knowing i did everything alone guzuYump

[3:42:16] dirbagdan: I want to see new shit not just the old dungeons. Don't get me wrong this is cool, but new dungeons please.
[3:42:17] Horfent: thats their own fault
[3:42:17] sircrumpler: I don't think they're gonna do an sm raid
[3:42:18] xelm_: @Schloomi EU.

[3:42:30] sircrumpler: Agreed
[3:42:31] Mapsize_: Tyrs hand and kara new endgame at the end
[3:42:34] Boneyards_666: i vote st
[3:42:36] gorebag13: ST would be great
[3:42:39] Mr_Moffert: New raid instead of remake
[3:42:39] basedbay: Maraudon because no one likes it
[3:42:40] Shreddingly: we've played season of monastery
[3:42:40] Yvernaa: Maraudon and ST my two favorite vanilla dungeons pogg
[3:42:40] sircrumpler: I hope it's maraudon, I hate ST so so much
[3:42:42] Alper2210: bet sunken aswell
[3:42:44] Smooo07: ST with lots of holes ofc
[3:42:47] xelm_: man ppl really just come in here to ask which server ur playing. they dont actually care about your stream
[3:42:47] Nunadaaa: golf
[3:42:48] Kinghorn: EU OR PVP???
[3:42:48] techno22322: What about ZF being locked out
[3:42:49] Smooo07: hehe
[3:42:49] xelm_: guzuBeliever
[3:42:49] Schloomi: thx a lot
[3:42:50] HydroDanno: Do you think Jokerd will be a boss in Mara Raid

[3:43:04] sircrumpler: Grim batol too in wetlands would be sick
[3:43:06] Nunadaaa: @ssupermario64 I'd say enhance but im biased

[3:43:17] NilzVentura: @ssupermario64 enhcance is smooth
[3:43:22] Boneyards_666: they could stick an orc skeleton with a staff down the hole in st in the raid  and then it revives and becomes a boss pogg
[3:43:23] Wolfchamane: and how we wiil get ZF mallet?
[3:43:25] sircrumpler: They have a lot of good raid opportunities tbh
[3:43:25] cazaadoris: SM raid, was at blizzcon. in the presentation
[3:43:26] handovdoom666: do you think there won't be a lot of content from 40-50? There's only 3 dungeons (ZF, Mara, ST) and one will be a raid. seems kinda light (unless I'm forgetting something)
[3:43:27] Yvernaa: Hyjal raid maybe PauseChamp
[3:43:28] Mr_Moffert: PogU firbolg raid
[3:43:29] Gorr82: tyr's hand or heartglen would be cool too
