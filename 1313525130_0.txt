[1:22:29] braadleeyy: depends on kick assignments
[1:22:38] moo__snuckle: just kill the boss 4Head
[1:22:46] braadleeyy: if you guys are doing range kicks, nothing, if not, you gotta be on your kicks when the human adds come out
[1:22:47] CallMeDoubleYou: wait todays monday Susge

[1:23:17] CallMeDoubleYou: @gritz_n_pitz TriDance
[1:23:17] braadleeyy: ok so you gotta know what mob entrance you're gonna kick at: either this door or kj side
[1:23:30] braadleeyy: yeah
[1:23:33] doronamo: sodaDink repair bot
[1:24:28] golaki: say your prayers and kiss your loved ones...we about to go in.
[1:24:43] braadleeyy: fwiw we solely use ranged kickers on the caster mobs and let melee stay closer to muru to switch to him when advantageous
[1:24:55] braadleeyy: but of course ymmv
[1:25:10] CallMeDoubleYou: this dude got a potty mouth
[1:25:41] braadleeyy: doubtful

[1:25:45] golaki: o___O
[1:25:49] vivivenes: w
[1:25:52] golaki: LOL
[1:26:26] CallMeDoubleYou: kick em in the balls
[1:26:28] braadleeyy: the kick is purely a positioning play. it's not a damage thing. it's so your offtanks can get the mobs in the proper spot asap
[1:26:49] vantablackx: OMEGAWOW
[1:26:54] golaki: lol
[1:27:05] braadleeyy: in ~15s after initial pull
[1:27:05] doronamo: they come out behind you a couple of seconds into the fight
[1:27:08] timmon_: 20s after pull about and every 1min
[1:27:22] braadleeyy: just keep an eye on entrance
[1:27:25] timmon_: but the first kick gotta come from range
[1:27:28] timmon_: resto or whatever
[1:28:29] braadleeyy: so, the kick is *only* for the caster to be able to move from its casting spot. if you see it's coming in from the door, you don't need to run to kick it
[1:28:42] braadleeyy: don't even really need to kick then
[1:28:55] braadleeyy: it's just a positioning thing, damage is not a big issue. just cleave off muru if possible
[1:29:36] braadleeyy: it's like: when there's no darkness around muru, you should be cleaving off muru, where the mobs should be. once darkness comes out, you gotta start killing the humanoids one by one asap
[1:29:54] braadleeyy: so that when darkness is gone you go right back to muru. and it happens once every minute
[1:31:31] braadleeyy: it's all about add management in the first phase. that guide brushes over it but it's make or break
[1:31:37] doronamo: LETSGO
[1:33:15] 21jayden__: new house
[1:33:24] 21jayden__: soooon

[1:41:09] braadleeyy: the first humanoid pull you guys get a bit spoiled because the locks are available to seed off muru, but that won't happen every time
[1:41:50] Slum25: @jakenbakeLIVE looking cute today
[1:41:58] CallMeInfinity: @Slum25, widepeepoCute yyjHeart
[1:41:59] braadleeyy: the way it works is on the first sentinel, the locks get their enslave buddies
[1:42:13] braadleeyy: but every sentinel after that the humanoids should be moved to the nearly dead sentinel so the locks can preseed off them into the void spawns
[1:42:19] braadleeyy: it's a dance

[1:47:29] braadleeyy: that doesn't cancel an auto

[1:57:41] esSaRre: What class do you have tanking the sentinel?
