[2:05:20] zenkaigo_: you can buy all of them
[2:05:21] SpoofAvatar: buy from vendor I thought
[2:05:22] Alegnowar: buy them in undercity
[2:05:22] klindatu: 10K
[2:05:24] Wcvechten: buy them at the heirloom vendor in IF
[2:05:25] Zip13: They changed the requirements and can buy it now with less hassle

[2:05:56] PvtHudson093: I swear to god Divine Toll better be a talent in 10.0
[2:06:00] draken4o: for me all the systems that are tied to player power should be advanced naturally by playing the content you want. With majority of the new ability/conduits n stuff.. simply learned durring leveling.
[2:06:01] Alegnowar: Ye it's so good, i love the fact it unlocks map too
[2:06:04] Zip13: Yeah buy all of them. It really helps out
[2:06:09] Funderik: you know what blizzard will do tho.. they will find away to bring back n'zoth then death wing for round 2 raid fights, if dragon isles is true.
[2:06:13] amricatt: Very useful toys.
[2:06:14] SpoofAvatar: think its a boa item you can send to an alt

[2:06:23] ILikeKillTheZombies: one thing i hate about 9.2 is that i have to unlock flying again
[2:06:25] FreshieFresh: It's waaaay past time
[2:06:27] pacificmc1: Divine Toll should be baseline for all paladins

[3:55:41] sinlesssinner: @manmower i bet thrall was all up in there :)
[3:55:47] xarivh: @manmower its the shaman hall from legion
[3:55:48] Nougat_V: a dragon xpac doenst even make sense? maybe something with the light and the dark lords
[3:55:54] crypticnightwing21: did they say when the next expansion will be release
[3:55:59] elandura: I'm not buying the next expansion unless I see that it's good. I used to have the goodwill get me going buying the expansions without a doubt, not anymore.
[3:56:00] CaptainAlkohol: god i would not have wanted to spend 2 years on argus
[3:56:01] invisiblesock26: I just want to be back on Azeroth

[3:56:31] Tethyr: @Jar_jar_b other side of the map
[3:56:34] sinlesssinner: @elandura every expansion is good at the start, the leveling, new dung, new gear, new feeling... they always fail in the end game
[3:56:35] manmower: maybe an xpac where we go to the backside of azeroth
[3:56:44] TweakT: retail is reviving agane?
[3:56:54] Rudric_Ice: Idk why people talk about player housing so much i don't find it "engaging"
[3:56:57] geokouts: btw you can always DONT buy the game if you dont like it :P
[3:57:03] mavericks312: you can trip over 20k gold a day
[3:57:08] itsjustcarr: !ORIGIN
[3:57:11] Merkarion: To be honest, the Idea of Azeroth awakening and beeing a kind of Dragon...why not. I mean it is 10.0 !!! there need to be something big...and Dragons are a Core-Part of Fantasy and Warcraft
[3:57:14] SicDogg: i wonder how much the token cost them
[3:57:16] xo_navi: other than boosting what?
[3:57:16] elandura: @sinlesssinner SL was straight up disappointment for me from the getgo. If it weren't for friends, I wouldn't even keep playing.
[3:57:16] MeisterPetze: i buy gold, no time for farm
[3:57:19] LUKA_THIM: for 7 years nothing from wallet
[3:57:19] iblighters: I haven't payed since WoD
[3:57:21] TweakT: ye but wow tok went up twice prie since 1 year agoe
[3:57:24] Treviathon: I haven't paid for wow since token came out
[3:57:28] TweakT: its not easy to farm wow token
[3:57:30] indoblood: @Towelliee at least name some gold methods then
[3:57:31] LourageTV: seasonal players buy shit loads of tokens though
[3:57:31] sinlesssinner: @Rudi_Ice its an extra thing in the game... thats why ppl are happy that blizzard isnt bieng stingy about adding stuff
[3:57:41] shuey23: @TweakT its super easy
[3:57:43] xo_navi: not without boosting
[3:57:44] QuantumleaperGG: i played wod and legion for "free" with gold
[3:57:46] manmower: aren't tokens like 200k?
[3:57:46] draconisraccoonis: korthia dailies pay out
[3:57:47] ntellectual_disability: 1b g
[3:57:47] Throkkz: dailies is easy 5k gold
[3:57:48] Daddyknut: farming gold is so fucking boring so i rather pay real cash lol
[3:57:51] Thunderbrew: Play the game and pay for sub
[3:57:51] enux337: just do old raids
[3:57:51] cidthesloth420: when i played i never payed real money for sub just made gold and bought everything
[3:57:51] Jarless: super super easy
[3:57:53] Poriand: im sitting on 2.5 mill. all i do is skinning / mining and the content
[3:57:54] shuey23: i get enough gold for a token in 3 days
[3:57:56] jasperboy: 2-3 boost runs
[3:57:58] enux337: on multiple toons
[3:58:07] TheRiwen: you need 300k+ for a tokens on EU
[3:58:07] draconisraccoonis: you gotta grind a bit to make the gold but its worth
[3:58:08] iblighters: I do 10 callings a day and make 140k a week
[3:58:09] Mazeltough: doing your calling dailies is enough to pay for your sub every month
[3:58:22] Samurai3434: It's so easy to make gold. Heck, just callings on a few characters is enough for a token
[3:58:23] Hakazo: !leaks

[3:58:23] AmericanFat: how many millions you need to buy a next expansion ? if you convert
[3:58:26] draconisraccoonis: people are lazy
[3:58:34] Snabido: Spoiled by garrison/legion mission tables
[3:58:35] pacificmc1: maybe people should get a job instead, farming gold is like working for 1 euro per hour KEKW
[3:58:37] Daikanatv: lets say you have 10 60s and do callings it is on average 19k a day
[3:58:39] Orthobullet: i just do both
[3:58:39] sinlesssinner: @elandura oh i see. Maybe you ll get beta and can decide then before you have to buy the next expac :)
[3:58:39] garmin1987: EU is 284k for a token at moment
[3:58:43] Poriand: I would much rather have the gold lol even tho i dont spend my gold
[3:58:48] geokouts: have many 60s on one realm and then farm and give all to one :P
[3:58:49] Porcos_Voadores: !leaks
[3:58:50] Aquadriel: problem is that to amke gold people have to play the game.. but they dont want to LUL
[3:58:57] TheRiwen: has 44 alts but cant level them up in SL
[3:59:04] valianya: I think the idea of each zone dealing with one flight is great, if they're doing dragonflight specific powers then it Shouldn't be 'meaningful' choice locking you out of content, it should either just be always active in that zone, or you choose what banner to carry at any time or rested area
[3:59:05] mavericks312: ppl want WoW to be f2p but it kinda is in away
[3:59:07] Daddyknut: i havnt done a calling in ages, that shit is so boring
[3:59:09] TweakT: nah we can't buy physical products at least in EU
[3:59:09] shuey23: yeah i do callings on 4 toons and maybe spend every day an hour mining/ skinning/ herbing got alchemy/ blacksmithing and lw alts
[3:59:11] sinlesssinner: i dont use gold to buy shit.. i dont do professions :)
[3:59:14] swordart_19: I buy games with gold EZ
[3:59:15] Treviathon: I bought all store  mounts with wow Tokens too
[3:59:22] elandura: Maybe people are getting too bored when playing to make gold. And eventually they don't want to do anything even for gold farming.
[3:59:34] onybear: You got this!
[3:59:34] JacobBose: I have half a million gold. Just wait for New Xpac Do some raids get some BOE and sell fast then dont spend the gold on dumb shit and you set for a long time
[3:59:40] xo_navi: so spend all day farming gold ( unless you boost M+ etc ) to pay for that work meh not worth it lol
[3:59:45] geokouts: if people want WoW to become F2P expect a heavyload of microtransactions
[3:59:55] thedevilzstorm: so to make the gold is to sell in auction house? would that be the best option or to make stuff and sell?
[4:00:22] Jarless: 10k a day is easy mode
[4:00:26] Samurai3434: You  don't need to spend nearly all day to make a token. Like 20 min a day and you're good
[4:00:27] thedevilzstorm: ahhh
[4:00:29] mavericks312: you can make like 7k gold just from callings and korthia pending ah prices
[4:00:30] onybear: At least

[4:00:33] Porcos_Voadores: omg another elf exclusive class thats SO boring omg. hate elves
[4:00:33] cidthesloth420: a few hrs each day farming for gold is not that hard to do
[4:00:36] onybear: Per toon
[4:00:42] Hybridwarhawk: I haven't played in a bit, what is a token going for these days?
[4:00:42] TheRiwen: kortia arghhhh
[4:00:42] iblighters: I make 20k a day in about an hour doing the callings
[4:00:44] JacobBose: You can farm honor buy pvp armour and disenchant.
[4:00:45] Quecklain: just boost mythic raids 4Head
[4:00:45] ILikeKillTheZombies: i didnt have luck buying my token, EU token price raised up by 10 k and i had no time left
[4:00:47] ILikeKillTheZombies: :D
[4:00:50] draconisraccoonis: 5k a day 5 days a week, gives you a little over 125k gold a month. 5 k is literally korthia dailies on one char
[4:00:58] jacooners: its funny cause im always subbed. when the game is good i never pay cause i have gold from playing whens its bad i pay haha

[4:01:19] mmrghost7: i am fed up with dragons , they are in every single game
[4:01:20] Aidler: hmm I have a feeling only the boosters make the real gold. I'm doing all the stuff on several toons and could not effort the tokens
[4:01:20] TheRiwen: callings are so bad because of the wq's
[4:01:35] trevt6: im so sick of separated zones, i miss 1 big continent expac

[4:04:10] mandilozano: just playing wow for a month can get you easily enough gold to buy a game token, anyone that complains is a casual
[4:04:14] mavericks312: participation awards at its best
[4:04:16] serbiandruglordx: what do you remember about mop class design?
[4:04:17] smashwow: here's the issue with gold farming. by selling a token, blizz has put a per hour value on gold. roughly 20$ per 200k gold. if your farm makes say half that and you have the income to spend on gold. it's just a "better" investment to buy gold than sell on a per hour rate. etc etc
[4:04:18] bumpstock75: lego will useless .... Why would they let keep something you spent time on.

[4:36:43] valianya: I feel there isn't enough content aimed at average players that isn't designed to impact or appeal to top 5% and bottom 5%.  Basically if it doesn't directly impact top players through player power or high end content, or isn't dumbed down and handed out on a platter, then there isn't attention given to developing the not impactful or easy but fun content

[5:21:02] SirTedric: yea dps is jus shit rn @Vile_ and devs even admitted it but theyre doing something about it lol
[5:21:15] Vile_: The engine in FF sucks and is dated, there are a lot of archaic BS nonsense stuff but it's not "in a bad spot."
