[0:24:58] Smungathon: In The Groove used S+ - SSS for rankings
[0:25:01] Dunpeel: it started from fighting games
[0:25:01] ITHROWTRAINZ: Super Cars
[0:25:02] kmac1992a: 'S' tier may stand for "Special", "Super", or the Japanese word for "Exemplary" (秀, shū), and originates from the widespread use in Japanese culture of an 'S
[0:25:04] alpacabowldood: Japanese word for "Exemplary" (秀, shū)
[0:25:06] TheDeavs: Shts on all others
[0:25:09] grymnyr_: It comes from Japanese games. S, S+ etc
[0:25:10] Nezhoni: SSS
[0:25:12] MightyCactus1: It comes from the japanese word for exemplary
[0:25:21] angelc843: The tier system is based on the American grading system, but the S rank was borrowed from the Japanese grading system. While S is most often used in a pass/fail context to indicate “satisfactory” performance in the U.S., the Japanese school systems added an S rank above A to allow a wider spectrum of possible grades.
[0:25:35] Eddz20: Could say its an s-tier tier Kappa
[0:25:42] r0ger_this: gran turismo used  the S tier system wayyy back in 1997
[0:25:44] jiggyspice: Xar can i ask your opinon on meta gaming culture? Good or bad?

[0:25:52] SatanicAngelBlazed: like warriors rofl
[0:25:53] zerozuckerl: ouch
[0:25:53] kmac1992a: why did they skip E in grading then/ they go from D to F
[0:25:55] Pudgypantss: never
[0:25:58] itkbutt3rs: S is for sugoi which means extra ordinary
[0:25:59] Nappycans: Same feeling
[0:26:13] littlehak: YEP
[0:26:19] lastad94: How do you recomend taking protein powder? I get upset stomach drinking it (i have it with milk)
[0:26:23] adam_brisbane: that was the layer issue was not dynamic as they were fixing lag issues with stv but they are starting to use dynamic again
[0:26:27] myyrlidon: Xar have you seen One Piece
[0:26:29] DingzGaming: get rid of the layers please
[0:26:30] Zalien13: @Xaryu Yo xar how you doing ? hopfully good

[0:26:38] r0ger_this: bro is lactose intolerant
[0:26:41] tophman: Fairlife protein shakes are awesome
[0:26:44] shaks1437: LOL its hte milk bro
[0:26:45] SynthAttackTM: @Xaryu do u take vitamin D & K and magnesium extra from AG1? jsut checked the list and those are not in it sadly
[0:26:45] angelc843: Its probably the milk not the protein powder
[0:26:46] Skaxxx: take it with water wth
[0:26:47] BarbsCozyCorner: try isolate or pea protein :)
[0:26:50] MightyCactus1: Yeah, a dev put out an interesting blog about layering and how they are trying to develop dynamic layering, aka auto scaling up and down
[0:26:54] Fujinator: layers suck in blood moon too as they randomly phase you out
[0:26:56] DragoncakezZz: skim milk makes the shakes easier on the tummy
[0:26:56] lastad94: I have tried many brands but dont rly remember specifics.
[0:26:57] pockets519: Bloodmoon has been feeling empty tho
[0:27:04] Ervill1: cant the game only layer in stv?
[0:27:05] Digitadoomslayer: Yo wsg @Xaryu
[0:27:08] aceyda: @lastad94 there is "clear isolate" wheys, you drink those with water and they taste like soda (cola, lemon, ice tea peach taste)
[0:27:08] Nappycans: its hard to get groups right now it feels like
[0:27:13] ITHROWTRAINZ: not lactose intolerant you're just not a baby cow lol..
[0:27:15] yaybump: I think certain zones should be layered and others not unless needed.
[0:27:23] Nappycans: @yaybump i like that
[0:27:24] casun: bro not pea protein holy shit thats thing is nasty
[0:27:25] bramicmar: and they're minging
[0:27:25] SynthAttackTM: whey isolate should have minimal lactose
[0:27:29] Grocery7: GNC hydrogenated whey used to destroy my stomach
[0:27:32] ImSo1337: Try vegan - Onnit makes a solid one. Best tasting too
[0:27:33] Grocery7: depends on the protein powder i think
[0:27:45] aceyda: @lastad94 where u from I might be able to recommend you soth
[0:27:46] aBradAbroad: GNOMER TIME QUIT STALLIN! @Xaryu
[0:27:48] lastad94: @aceyda can you recomend a brand
[0:27:52] Phrosted_: 🤖 FOR GNOMERGAN 🤖
[0:27:55] ralphh1541: so sharding
[0:27:58] ketchgg: thats how retail works @Xaryu and people hate it
[0:27:58] MightyCactus1: Layers per zone is whats in retail and they call it 'sharding'
[0:27:59] Splitix: That's sharding
[0:28:00] lastad94: @aceyda houston
[0:28:10] SynthAttackTM: @Xaryu do u take vitamin D & K and magnesium extra to AG1? jsut checked the list and those are not in it sadly
[0:28:10] Zyin055: 2019 we campaigned hard to not have sharding...
[0:28:17] adam_brisbane: Classic team said that is not possible currently

[0:37:21] calm_palm_tree: have the warrior run outside the ranged group and when he he gets targeted by chain lightning he charges into melee group
[0:37:23] kino_kino89: hi mom
[0:37:31] ColePowerz: cause it hits the two closet to them

[0:38:19] ITHROWTRAINZ: what you say to me xD
[0:38:20] fellifell: what website is this?
[0:38:22] calm_palm_tree: you can do electrocutioner with only the warrior having to be the one moving
[0:38:31] roflpotamus: Medge
[0:38:37] itsthingb: wooaah you kiss your mother with that mouth young man!
[0:38:41] espi: it can't NOT chain, it ALWAYS chains to 2 targets
[0:38:44] RS_Reaver: yes it still chains
[0:38:50] rubmyleg: yea we did that last raid, it works well
[0:38:55] RS_Reaver: thats why you split melee to two sides
[0:39:02] bockylockie: you can do the mage strat
[0:39:05] Armaerei: you only need 1 person to move for electrocutioner.. just split melee into 2 groups and have 1 ranged mid range from one group, 1 range moves further and closer for the other group
[0:39:07] fgaudreau05: TBAngel TBAngel
[0:39:09] espi: THIS STRAT WORKS

[0:39:19] StripSniper: it would work tho
[0:39:22] pmanfit91: Yes.

[0:39:24] konagosk: itll work just fine
[0:39:24] morfius09: yep yep
[0:39:24] bloodsnaill: man people way overthinking this lol just blast and groups move
[0:39:31] lebroswki: was this made by a raiding PHD XD
[0:39:36] espi: @bloodsnaill groups move = bad
[0:39:41] SatanicAngelBlazed: A squad only
[0:39:43] naturalduck: It chains to closer targets
[0:39:43] morfius09: it’s ez just stand on opposite sides of the boss
[0:39:46] AsusCom: its easier . because aonly 2 people moive. not 6
[0:39:46] Rumseyrum04: it’s so easy what
[0:39:47] English_Uk: its only two people who move.
[0:39:47] pmanfit91: Assign group 1 to the left, group 2 to the right. Healers position accordingly based on their group, and GG.
[0:39:50] ColePowerz: do it
[0:39:57] tristkn: resto sham better than rdru right?
[0:39:58] Jubilation12: this is basic stuff lol
[0:40:01] grizzlyhead: warrior tank
[0:40:04] ngl85: @Xaryu do you if hardcore ssf will have a new server? or just an option you choose on new char creation?  󠀀

[0:40:07] espi: @tristkn no shamans on alliance
[0:40:10] sansxietyy: ITS GOOD , GOOD LOOT FOR UOU
[0:40:18] Goobadoobadoob: We completed it without wild strikes so this should be good
[0:40:19] hiro25000: soaking on electro will be harsh
[0:40:19] tristkn: @espi oh true
[0:40:20] bockylockie: You can do the mage strat where he takes the first lightinging then blinks into melee so that the ranged group takes the next one and so on
[0:40:20] hutchyy917: yeah you'll be fine. i ran feral OT last night for first time in gnomer and was smooth
[0:40:23] AsusCom: @Xaryu range hunter can be melee on 1-2-3-4 bosses. and switch to range on 5-6
[0:40:24] SatanicAngelBlazed: Just bring chads lul
[0:40:25] Kosmicpanther: send it
[0:40:30] dreamreamer: Our guild down last boss last week and we were melee heavy with no feral cause he had to heal lol
[0:40:32] bloodsnaill: @xaryu you can kill it before second chain goes out
[0:40:38] Wrestler: Yo can someone link that raidplaner again
[0:40:43] tristkn: replace rdru with hpal?
[0:40:48] calm_palm_tree: do that with warrior he can charge boss
[0:40:54] jiggyspice: Xar can I get your 2 cents on "meta gaming culture" Good or bad for mmo's in general?
[0:40:57] espi: The mage exploit is fixed. You can still use a mage as your mover.
[0:40:59] pmanfit91: Didn't you try that?
[0:41:00] cyrusctff7: good morning Xar.
[0:41:01] rubmyleg: it works, i did it 2 days ago
[0:41:03] tsyter: if you have to do a strat this complicated to kill it then i call thiss boss an F
[0:41:12] English_Uk: is it just SSF or is it Auto HC?
[0:41:12] hutchyy917: min/max only
[0:41:14] ZenFM: How do you kill sheep on menagerie? You might need boomkin
[0:41:15] Muckbot1: Yes, everyone min maxing
[0:41:16] calm_palm_tree: have your ranged group stay still and once they have debuff warrior runs outside then charges in once he’s targeted
[0:41:21] jiggyspice: yeah
[0:41:31] hotpor123: i think its more fun to go in blind and figure it out
[0:41:32] shadowstorm_sod: That's why they should band logs
[0:41:35] Veree: no honorable kills today?:(
[0:41:40] shadowstorm_sod: Ban logs*
[0:41:45] sottifem: agreed
[0:41:51] Jubilation12: @shadowstorm_sod logging is built into the game tho
[0:41:51] angelc843: @shadowstorm_sod ^^^
[0:41:57] hotpor123: yea those damm loggs
[0:41:59] hotpor123: :p
[0:42:07] littlehak: @shadowstorm_sod I agree but I don't think it'll ever happen
[0:42:09] dingerdoom: log slaves are annoying, hard to enjoy raiding and finding a group
[0:42:15] Lebbe89: @shadowstorm_sod why just dont watch log if u dont want logs
[0:42:25] stimmedmarin: Amazon is used by small companies...
[0:42:27] naturalduck: People gravitate towards easier things, it's devs responsibility to create balance so meta gaming isn't as important
[0:42:28] Maiqthehighking: 1
[0:42:29] Cross86: hello there xar
[0:42:30] Erwincrates: SeemsGood
[0:42:32] iamwallner: Min maxing in games sacrifices fun for efficiency, its horrible imo
[0:42:37] zerozuckerl: fax
[0:42:37] angelc843: I got told my logs on Thermaplugg were scary... its because I was on a boomkin and killing bombs. Thats why his group will likely not clear for several weeks.
[0:42:39] d0ornokey: It's just the world and Technology getting better
[0:42:41] shadowstorm_sod: @jubilation12 if it's built into the game y do I have to get a third party app to look at it?
[0:42:42] grizzlyhead: Aware
[0:42:44] Seabrax: off topic - rank 5 trinket makes pvp feel so much better xar 😂 mr corporal :)
[0:42:44] rroshann: Damn
[0:42:46] RS_Reaver: @stimmedmarin he prob means brick and mortar
[0:42:52] jiggyspice: thank you for the answer
[0:42:59] theburn420: Whats good legend man
[0:43:06] hotpor123: yea you just gotta find people that also like to play by finding out not looking everyhing up
[0:43:06] adam_brisbane: rank 5 trinket
[0:43:08] Jubilation12: @shadowstorm_sod that app simply quantifies it. advanced combat logging is a vanilla setting
[0:43:09] talboo000: New World without DPS meters help for toxicity in dungeons
[0:43:16] blaadje_: imagine wow without any add-on / guide
[0:43:19] hotpor123: what i did on my first raid
[0:43:19] Peschke9: are you doing gnomer again?
[0:43:34] Peschke9: I thought you ran it yesterday
[0:43:40] jiggyspice: Would you be hyped if hypothetically an mmo was created which could not be min maxed?
[0:43:42] BarberSnipez: it reset already @Peschke9
[0:43:48] Peschke9: @BarberSnipez ohhh right
[0:43:48] Weedweed: where is everybody today? @Xaryu
[0:43:48] BarberSnipez: today
[0:43:53] LilTaisu: Add it lol
[0:43:56] InsertYourseIf: Watching you do blind gnomergone was so fun to watch tho
[0:43:58] shadowstorm_sod: @lebbe89 because people want to talk shit because u do 100 less DPS and act like it's the end of the world hahah nothing to do with if I want to use them or not when I don't get a choice to post them or not.
[0:44:05] Fenri25: anyone have a link to that guide
[0:44:09] ipntheshower: "Pandora don't go back in the box only out" - James Franco Pineapple Express
[0:44:11] Maiqthehighking: HUH
[0:44:11] tsyter: you should still be able to kill the boss without knowing all the spoiler info , needing the spoilers to kill it is bad game creation
[0:44:12] TwitchIsAHorribleCompany: AT&T cucking me
[0:44:13] Sloppywet: @xaryu thottbot!
[0:44:16] Yokedo: Lost Ark didnt have meters and the same gatekeeping based on class / spec
[0:44:16] Landotazo: sucking butt is worse
[0:44:17] Genghish: Family friendly butsucking
[0:44:18] DanPlaysChess: I KNOW that is pronounced differently, but I much prefer calling it Guh-no-mer-gone.
[0:44:18] gmazca: FF14 doesn't support addons. worked out well in my opinion
[0:44:21] Erwincrates: sucking the hairy ring
[0:44:21] bewmX: sucking butt is worse somehow
[0:44:32] shadowstorm_sod: @lebbe89 and I don't buy gold so I can have 20 consumes
[0:44:43] Plaguethong: xD
[0:44:47] taylorsdank: still got madseeasons pandoras box :O
[0:44:54] hotpor123: how long does it normally take for blizzard if you sublit a ticket?
[0:44:55] Muckbot1: When are you forming Gnomer Group @Xaryu
[0:44:56] Maiqthehighking: is your cell phone service down in Arizona there?
[0:45:00] ipntheshower: @taylorsdank TRU ASF
[0:45:06] spaceghostie47: @ipntheshower the monkeys out of the bottle man XD
[0:45:07] pokemango7: people still use addons in FFXIV, there is a dps meter
[0:45:10] RingersRealm: I'd quit
[0:45:10] BarbsCozyCorner: I love my addons
[0:45:12] gmazca: yeah, no way to go back for wow
[0:45:12] tonyg_1103: hello xaryu will you play hardcore sf on the 29th ?
[0:45:12] shadowstorm_sod: Logs r for people that can't talk to a person in RL
[0:45:14] SatanicAngelBlazed: FF14 also has mechanic indicators built in
[0:45:14] hutchyy917: @Xaryu, you should do a swear jar (family friendly streamer)...at the end of the month, that's how many subs you gift
[0:45:14] regulater45: I'd quit
[0:45:15] jiggyspice: game would die instantly
[0:45:17] RaizenHQ: It would be better without addons
[0:45:17] handovdoom666: they did that with GDKP
[0:45:19] Veree: i would love it
[0:45:19] daschadwick: morning sir xarski
[0:45:20] reggiepowa: addons are core part of wow, just accept it
[0:45:20] TrueNosus: thatd be amazing tbh
[0:45:22] Balomyt: Wow just cant exist without addons at this point
[0:45:25] WaaDeeTV: :D gnomer are saysing this, " addons are no longer allowed"
[0:45:29] taylorsdank: pika said he'd LOVE if they took all the addons away lol
[0:45:29] Weedweed: Weakauras are the biggest crutch for 90% of WoW gamers
[0:45:31] adam_brisbane: you know if you take away add ons that would remove the bots
[0:45:31] pokemango7: I never had a problem with addons but i HATE warcraft logs for raiding
[0:45:32] Erwincrates: read quests again
[0:45:33] naturalduck: Wow devs developed fights that made weakauras necessary
[0:45:34] hkd86: btw guys, gdkp is no longer alllowed , kekw
[0:45:35] shadowstorm_sod: Gives them something to make themselves feel like they rnt losers lol
[0:45:35] jiggyspice: but ironically addons is the only reason why I dont play retail
[0:45:35] hotpor123: without questie would be fucked
[0:45:38] Mozzeyy_: man i have no idea why people hate addons.. i love the way u can customize the game with them
[0:45:38] MiztykTV: they are trying to get rid of addons?
[0:45:41] Seabrax: if they banned dps meters in wow that would be enough to make me want to quit. aside from everything else lmao
[0:45:44] Orcgasm: not really I know every q by heart
[0:45:47] SoSoBurrito: addons now available for purchase in the WOW store guzuSUS
[0:45:47] andyl0l: When they tried to nerf weak auras the top guilds just had to do some of the jankest weak aura commands
[0:45:58] daschadwick: is this something they are talking about doing?
[0:46:01] Peschke9: @SoSoBurrito for 80 dollars
[0:46:01] Chefy0shi: ashes of creation  no add ons from the get
[0:46:02] SatanicAngelBlazed: Ya FF14 has like DBM built into it
[0:46:02] StripSniper: Addons help people with blindness and other disabilities, and i doubt wow devs would develop anything close to what addons are doing
[0:46:02] tonyg_1103: HC Hype
[0:46:03] Lebbe89: @shadowstorm_sod lol nc ...
[0:46:04] BarbsCozyCorner: I’ve been using questie plus another one that shows the quest areas on the map. I’d be lost
[0:46:10] Grocery7: yeah everyone needs 50 sirens going off in their speakers for PVP in retail

[1:42:42] obajawanke: its how easy they made gear to get for everyone doing ANYTHING
[1:42:42] Qeevdo: No one would bother to raid. Farming enough gold for that for 20+ years gets old
[1:42:43] bottis96: solo players would be crap
[1:42:45] ganklust: @mooda32 yes it did
[1:42:46] tekkors1: This generation ruined it... If they cant have end game content in 15 minutes they give up. Tiktok brain

[1:43:04] Erbsosa: heirlooms werent bad
[1:43:05] Panic_Robot: They need to remove the annoying animations so I can play again.
[1:43:05] ellyger: That's why we ecstatic about +
[1:43:10] interghass266: The first Thing they must do is WOW 2 and rebuilding a new concept  with deleteing many unnessesary things
[1:43:11] ganklust: Flying mounts was the dumbest thing they ever did
[1:43:12] goonlips: my guild disbnding rn as we speak cuz the Guild lead got banned for 6 months for RMT
[1:43:13] The_RightTwix: Retail is amazing for raiding content, minus the roadblocks for getting there
[1:43:13] Rawnezz: *we just know about quality :)
[1:43:14] cory_lockman: people say group finder is so bad but yet they spam in LFG....
[1:43:16] Vandracon: a non tradable currency for some things
[1:43:18] Ayomeer: I would love to try the faster paced gameplay of retail but there is just 0 MMO feel

[1:43:24] mrthiccpurple: m+ is giga

[1:43:26] DragoncakezZz: i think retail vs classic is unfair, but instead you should compare retail to FFXIV
[1:43:29] Erbsosa: L take
[1:43:29] tuna_sandw1ch: @goonlips whats RMT?
[1:43:29] bgr_man: realistically LFD and LFR at its core isnt a problem. its the playerbase that has ruined it
[1:43:30] YEP_cawkk: solo shuffle also good

[1:43:49] POSrobot: M+ is way too repetitive for most people, it's like playing D3
[1:43:53] Kalyssa94: the casual classic andy is to dogshit for m+/mythic raiidng and would quit
[1:43:55] heyitsken_: starting late, in mop and having all these things already there when I started it doesn’t seem as bad. playing classic now I much prefer this style but a grey first experience is all that matters for keeping fans
[1:43:56] goonlips: @tuna_sandw1ch buying/ selling gold
[1:43:56] jay_deetv: the quality of life additions aren’t the issues a lot of people think it is
[1:43:57] ganklust: They shouldn't have increased level cap
[1:43:59] Sarbin: I do retail still, and my biggest issue is the pan handling out of loot to everyone. The challenge of the game has gone to the wayside.
[1:43:59] waskaie: i think they added wayy to much
[1:44:02] cory_lockman: new continent?
[1:44:03] valrash1981: m+ and gearscore make it miserable, everyone wants someone with maxxed gearscore to do a +1.
[1:44:08] ellyger: @andypandynz that's what I'm saying and once SoD gets to 60+ it's along the lines of what he's talking about
[1:44:10] cory_lockman: new race new class
[1:44:16] nikola420tesla: Pet Battles KEKW

[1:44:43] fridxa: It wouldnt be better
[1:44:47] Hor1zonX: solo shuffle
[1:44:47] bribri22222: hot take: the game would be dead without these systems. they were created BECAUSE subscriber counts were going down already, not the other way around. @Xaryu
[1:44:48] chazmc89: theres way too much bloat
[1:44:48] DragoncakezZz: i think retail vs classic is unfair, its 2 different games, but instead you should compare retail to FFXIV
[1:44:50] thewal1ofsleep: @POSrobot fact
[1:44:51] Tovone: who needs a level cap increase?
[1:44:53] jay_deetv: but all those things bring in almost 0 new players because the game isn’t noob friendly at all. you think removing quality of life helps that?
[1:44:54] tuna_sandw1ch: I liked TBC
[1:44:55] baldanduseless: we need another cataclysm type event that brings us back 8 years and go back to the basics
[1:44:55] waskaie: just add dungeons = win
[1:44:56] Fried1ord: and its easy to say from the perspective now
[1:44:58] Kalyssa94: no new talents?
[1:44:58] KairuruTV: i think MMORPGs suffer from the concept of "expansions" - if they were live updated games for things the game needs, it would be better - BUT that makes no money
[1:45:01] rsjcjones: thats literally what ffxiv did and people hate the new expsc
[1:45:05] Irotec_: im not a fan of GS and Logs
[1:45:06] The_RightTwix: I think us classic players need to admit that we NEED retail. Without retail, they wouldn't be able to fund SoD, SSF HC, etc.
[1:45:08] hoodgriddy: hoodgriddy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[1:45:09] waskaie: more molten core like raids thats it
[1:45:13] cory_lockman: i like solo shuffle but queue times suck because nobody wants to heal
[1:45:15] LuxzGaming: Im dont with this game man, not enjoying phase 2 at all
[1:45:16] rns_aurelius: i dont see much difference between lfg and spamming lfm in trade chat both are incredibly impersonal
[1:45:20] MightyCactus1: I think it would be better without level cap raises each xpac, but have unlocking the new raids/dungeons/zones tied to shorter story questlines that are more developed and interesting than just basic fetch/kill lvling quests
[1:45:22] SelWrynn: they shoulda gone with RBGs instead of Arenas for rated PvP
[1:45:23] cory_lockman: 12 min queues these days
[1:45:23] Xronik07: base
[1:45:26] ashraf_ma: Solo Shuffle is great the queues aren't
[1:45:26] ipetam: they when so derpy and cartoony with the new models as well
[1:45:30] Hor1zonX: true
[1:45:31] tuna_sandw1ch: TBC had some really cool areas with flying mounts..gruul's lair area was nice
[1:45:32] cypherdk94: They stuck too rigidly to the expansion process. Instead of raising level cap, adding new zones, new races. Create new questlines, new raids within same level range, new battlegrounds, new abilities, solo pve content.
[1:45:36] fivetailfox: i like Guild Wars where you get your skills and every expansion you just enjoy yourself.
[1:45:36] diresirl: Nahhh if WoW expan showcased 3 new classes or something wild like that then people would run to it. Or expanding the hero talents then what it is..perhaps making it truly feel unique as its own specialization
[1:45:36] gmazca: @rsjcjones Endwalker is a great expansion, got stale eventually though
[1:45:38] Diabolikkgg: shuffle rant xd
[1:45:44] fridxa: que is 20 minutes at most
[1:46:02] thesirganks: just remove healers from the mode
[1:46:09] YEP_cawkk: 3v3 was trash anyways for new players tbh
[1:46:10] CitizenDesmond: @rns_aurelius One of the differences is the teleporting to the instance. WIth LFG people never need to leave the city and the world ends up feeling more dead even if its very active.
[1:46:13] vigilantknives: the mmo aspect of the game
[1:46:14] Sarbin: I was doin RBGs yesterday, took 45mins to get games, to just have someone troll and blow the game every time.
[1:46:17] ashraf_ma: 3v3 is trash
[1:46:18] Ervill1: @rns_aurelius but apparently someone whispering you "inv" is a nice social experience and we don't want to take that away Kappa
[1:46:18] pokemango7: would a 1v1 mode be cool? or just more problematic?
[1:46:19] ellyger: Oh no xaryu... he did the shuffle talk
[1:46:23] fivetailfox: 3v3 is also dead in destiny 2
[1:46:23] Saberix69: I just want the new solo/group content is good, devels I think it's called lol
[1:46:26] baldanduseless: arena was best with teams and team rating @Xaryu
[1:46:27] interghass266: The first Thing they must do is WOW 2 and rebuilding a new MMO concept with harder  grindingand deleting many unnessesary things
[1:46:31] Qeevdo: would get old pretty quick
[1:46:35] angelc843: Remember the days you actually had a legit team for arena? Names and everything... nostalgia overload.
[1:46:36] Vichrinox: future is now old man
[1:46:37] fetza108: Metzen will save us
[1:46:42] fridxa: Shuffle is great, but just 99% of retail doesnt play pvp
[1:46:42] The_RightTwix: Remember though, we wouldnt have SoD without retail
[1:46:45] cypherdk94: They could also adopt some Moba like features, battlegrounds with lanes and mobs. Pve and Pvp.
[1:46:53] alucardd0117: @Xaryu do you plan to try a different class in SoD after Mage?
[1:47:06] MightyCactus1: I think it would be better without level cap raises each xpac, but have unlocking the new raids/dungeons/zones tied to shorter story questlines that are more developed and interesting than just basic fetch/kill lvling quests. New players would have easier time jumping in, and old players still get new content
[1:47:08] valrash1981: metzen is a drop in the ocean tbh
[1:47:09] DragoncakezZz: Is today the Melee raid?
[1:47:18] Alacay: @Xaryu as a healer i love shuffle, it allows me to get so much reps in and actually improve my own gameplay
[1:47:24] CitizenDesmond: @interghass266 No way, people been playing wow for years. Who would quit wow with 10+ years of content for new wow? not me
[1:47:34] gmazca: leveling in retail needs to be reworked and the endgame progression needs less baggage
[1:47:36] tekkors1: Came back after like a 5 year break just to play SoD after watching you. Is Retail PvP any good??
[1:47:37] Erbsosa: what is self found
[1:47:44] YEP_cawkk: when back pounding noobs in retail @Xaryu ?
[1:47:47] cypherdk94: @Xaryu when do you start training mage with your kid?
[1:47:54] ashraf_ma: @gmazca this man gets it
[1:47:59] boomski303: Whats up @Xaryu - watching stream from 35k feet in the air!
[1:48:00] Ervill1: long and hard
[1:48:01] Erbsosa: is it sanctioned or a made up thing
[1:48:06] Kalyssa94: its hardcore b4 official no?
[1:48:07] Razzinal: @Xaryu imagine having Tinyviolin in self-found.
[1:48:08] whyalwayssmee: when do u lvl a s priest? :P
[1:48:10] asist0ne: @erbsosa no mail ah or trading
[1:48:11] CitizenDesmond: @interghass266 Also a really tough sell, Like when they tried to resell overwatch
[1:48:12] lujohnson1989: Still undecided if you'll do SF?
[1:48:14] combatshock_: @Xaryu what bag addon is that?
[1:48:18] Diabolikkgg: Bless u @Xaryu
[1:48:19] espi: Did they do any fixes for professions for Self Found? Like, is enchanting useless?
[1:48:21] Erbsosa: is it a sanctioned server or random
[1:48:23] hpyeroo: huh
[1:48:25] Xronik07: light bless you
[1:48:27] Nightfocus: Yes But annoying Hard , like tidious hard , not as in You need skill to do that shit .... THATs the Problem
[1:48:30] heyitsken_: TOS
[1:48:30] beluga_boy07: Is there any final word on whether or not SSF will be serperate server or just dictated by a buff or something on ur toon? @Xaryu
[1:48:30] clogues: KEKW
[1:48:31] Ayomeer: you got one vulgar sneeze
[1:48:31] ShadeofPink: WTF was that beeped out sneezxe?!?! LUL
[1:48:32] lujohnson1989: I hope you do it man
[1:48:36] thendj: wasnt the hc addon already selffound?
[1:48:36] MarkoIRL: what about cata
[1:48:37] LuxzGaming: Do you think mage is a good pick if you want to try a caster for the first time?
[1:48:38] vak_hunt: its sorta your trademark thing isnt it
[1:48:39] coolcoolcool777dood: HOW DO I USE MY TWITCH PRIME????
[1:48:43] burritofritter: do makgora ssf
[1:48:46] thewal1ofsleep: I don't really understand the appeal of solo self found tbh
[1:48:47] mormac99: asmond said he will do self found
[1:48:47] ScryerTV: Bro i've been waiting 1 YEAR for you to play a rogue...
[1:48:48] aboringmac: we all know you cant resist ssf
[1:48:49] fivetailfox: i hate retail bc i did all the weekly raids and got nada, and then y roll on the vault this week also gave me nada
[1:48:54] timmyclemons: Hope you play SoDcore. that was fun to watch
[1:48:56] coolcoolcool777dood: HOW DO I USE MY TWITCH PRIME??
[1:48:56] zerozuckerl: do you mean undecided on playing launch or at all? @Xaryu
[1:48:57] DragoncakezZz: Sell your salvages you already have the mats for epic
[1:48:58] interghass266: @CitizenDesmond wow is drowning anyway , they have to make revolutionary decision if they wanna keep it alive
[1:48:58] cypherdk94: @Xaryu mage is lowkey the best 1v1 class, so slept on
[1:49:01] ScryerTV: I've been waiting 1 YEAR for you to play a rogue...
[1:49:07] DragoncakezZz: @Xaryu Sell your salvages you already have the mats for epic
[1:49:08] cypherdk94: won so many duels for gold today
[1:49:12] fetza108: i read a post about sfhc which said sfch is dead on arrival @Xaryu . this can be true?
[1:49:21] nemcoy: what do u have left to do in sod?
[1:49:25] obajawanke: finally tamed a broken tooth last night after 22 hours of eagle eyeing
[1:49:36] Shake4L: holy f thats inflaited
[1:49:38] gildrean: SSF is way better than sodcore
[1:49:47] Rello113: gnomer gonna reck sodcore
[1:49:48] coolcoolcool777dood: HOW DO I USE MY TWITCH PRIME?
[1:49:51] Dinomight3: SSF > SODCORE
[1:49:52] zerozuckerl: I liked sodcore but it would also be fine if it was just a p1 content thing
[1:49:54] burritofritter: how much hp do u have
[1:49:54] DragoncakezZz: @Xaryu Please sell your salvages you already have the mats for epic
[1:49:56] sushileafbeats: isnt it cheaper to make the bolts?
[1:49:58] ninjuhh_d4: Omg he just outed ravs name!?
[1:50:03] MikkyWu: payoU payoU
[1:50:04] ScryerTV: poll it
[1:50:06] adam_brisbane: a alt in Sod would be better then either
[1:50:07] HoksilaZi: SSF>
[1:50:10] highonacidd: 2 wows at the same time, man
[1:50:16] Ervill1: lets just play retail, sod, sodcore, ssf, and wotlk
[1:50:26] Genghish: Sodcore will be a shi show with gnomer
[1:50:26] pokemango7: @ninjuhh_d4 naw ozzy is a differnet guy
[1:50:29] xTravvvvv: whats the endgame of ssf or is it just hitting 60 with no raids?
[1:50:30] fetza108: sorry i cant waste my time with sfhc if i die my progression is lost.....
[1:50:35] terengee: what addon show you craft/profit price ?
[1:50:43] sushileafbeats: I very much enjoy watching you SSF / HC @Xaryu
[1:50:44] fridxa: @Xaryu go back to retail pvp
[1:50:45] obajawanke: hz wow feels so terribad when you die at 60
[1:50:47] The_RightTwix: Play SSF, people will have more fun if you're having fun
[1:50:47] Erbsosa: is SSF a sanctioned server
[1:50:48] ninjuhh_d4: Oh I thought u accidently called him ozzy cause that's his name?
[1:50:49] obajawanke: hc*
[1:50:49] cypherdk94: @Xaryu made like 80g today dueling 1v1 as a mage, its so good i feel its slept on and priests + other specs think they can steamroll
[1:50:49] SiegeDamage: what kind of variety are you thinking?
[1:50:51] cmilly1025: Just do wow variety
[1:50:56] lightninfury: @terengee TSM
[1:50:57] ScryerTV: Bro i've been waiting 1 year for you to play HC Rogue
[1:50:58] stimmedmarin: Xaryu, will SoD have to many spells so that it actualy ends up like playing Retail?
[1:50:59] baldanduseless: sod will get to a point of raidlogging then could do SF? @Xaryu
[1:51:00] The_RightTwix: No one will have fun if you are miserably playing SoD while SSF is launched
[1:51:00] Steiny1784: yo Xar I’m level 37, and leveling recommendations? STV has been a gankfest so I’m planning to avoid that zone until 40.
[1:51:01] CitizenDesmond: @ninjuhh_d4 nope
[1:51:03] Jubilation12: @fetza_twitch u can transfer hardcore characters for free
[1:51:09] Saberix69: Let's have like 80 versions of classic WoW lol
[1:51:09] dizzlethebot: @ninjuhh_d4 lol bro just relax
[1:51:11] dreadnaughttier98: Get it, so worth it
[1:51:14] FlyingLizardGT3: @Xaryu Doesn't variety mean you can play hardcore whenever you dont want to play other games?
[1:51:14] dreadnaughttier98: just takes time
[1:51:16] terengee: @lightninfury thx you
[1:51:16] big_bang_impact: Yep, get it Xar!
[1:51:22] ScottxTee: do it man lol
[1:51:24] PioIter: I only watch when stream wow, dont really like variety
[1:51:32] BigBubbalu: Have you thought about devoting specific days of the week to variety gaming instead @Xaryu ?
[1:51:32] its_slesh: Perform sepuku - japanese ritual suicide and transfer :D
[1:51:35] Sardaco: come raid and get it on hardcore @xaryu
[1:51:36] stimmedmarin: Xaryu, will SoD have to many spells so that it actualy ends up like playing Retail?
[1:51:41] markhound: xd
[1:51:43] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: actually got some sleep for once in the past month, hope i didnt miss too much
[1:51:49] DragoncakezZz: Did you do the mage quest for your offhand?
[1:51:49] Deatharmor98: @xaryu ive been trying to do this Frozen Murloc rune since last night and it wont work, any clue why?
[1:51:52] kabobroll: it's too much
[1:51:54] ScryerTV: yeah why would we get all what we want
[1:51:56] valrash1981: classic is where it's at, if we could set it to where it was un explored like back in the early 2k's it would be awesome.
[1:52:02] Plokoon100: yea .. imagine haveing a job as well added to thtat
[1:52:02] fetza108: yes
[1:52:07] dreadnaughttier98: It makes you question yourself on which version you wanna play constantly
[1:52:10] Saberix69: I like classic don't get me wrong
[1:52:14] fridxa: you are right retail + classic
[1:52:15] tuna_sandw1ch: there are only two classics: Cars and Rock
[1:52:16] baldanduseless: we need wow 2
[1:52:17] regulater45: Sup xar how's it going?
[1:52:20] baldanduseless: new engine new game
[1:52:23] weird_shot: 2 version Max would be good
[1:52:24] uncred95: wow 2 is a cope
[1:52:25] cypherdk94: @Xaryu Have you tried running brainfreeze frost spec? Free fireballs and frostfire very often, spamming r1 bolts etc. I know the heal is great but the dam increase is great in bgs, stv
[1:52:27] Ryzir: Glyph system fixes this problem to a degree like TWoW
[1:52:28] Xronik07: yep 3 its to much
[1:52:29] itsquetzy: hardcore and ssf hardcore needs to be the same
[1:52:33] Kettopossum: NODDERS
[1:52:33] eygton: I tho retail and sod is enough
[1:52:40] ScryerTV: F
[1:52:41] eygton: I think retail and sod is enough
[1:52:42] Grocery7: era, SoM, SOD, WOTLK, Retail, SSF?
[1:52:43] lampsterof79: This is all "Doscovery" to see whre interests are
[1:52:46] bottis96: spreads people out to much
[1:52:46] x_jdot: thats why i only play sod now
[1:52:46] asist0ne: Naw i like all of it.  play the timeline you like.
[1:52:49] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: i would like retail and classic but classic took its own path this time
[1:52:50] malnourish_: funny tho cause this what the playerbase asked for no?
[1:52:50] eygton: just make retail a little better
[1:52:51] vak_hunt: aggrend like "we can never make him happy"
[1:52:51] JamesRig: I loved reforging
[1:52:55] chazmc89: if i wasnt for retail alternatives i wouldnt be playing at all though
[1:52:57] jfive87: bro I’m playing my first mage and my am fire spec. this spec slaps!! but I run out of mana quick lol
[1:53:00] DragoncakezZz: MOP was peak wow IMO
[1:53:01] hutchyy917: those players wouldnt go to another version of wow, they would just go to a different game. different versions of wow  are enjoyable to different people, yeah?
[1:53:05] Diabolikkgg: @Xaryu spriest is fun
[1:53:06] fridxa: Classic should end with Wotlk, change my mind
[1:53:17] bribri22222: why does it say 43 on the gloves? @Xaryu
[1:53:20] baldanduseless: fire/frost shatter spec is crazy with instant pyro @Xaryu
[1:53:20] orange_chs: mop classic is gonna be fun
[1:53:24] Glorpylol: hey bro, i remember when you were talking about GCD in fortnite, are we old now lol???
[1:53:24] The_RightTwix: They will eventually get rid of WoW versions with low player bases. At some point they will want to cut development costs
[1:53:28] fetza108: these many version made people more addicted than they was
[1:53:33] gen1e: should just do retail and classic+ like runescape
[1:53:33] ndras: cata classic should never happen fk that
[1:53:36] ndras: waste of playerbase
[1:53:47] x_jdot: agree
[1:53:48] vak_hunt: true
[1:53:48] cryptoraven2: i think its time for WoW 2. Same difficulty, things to explore and much better graphics. Retail feels milked and the same.
[1:53:49] dan_mcpherson: you need a grime-encrusted salvage
[1:53:52] cypherdk94: Cata classic pvp is so good tho
[1:53:54] andypandynz: that makes no sense wtf lmao
[1:53:55] exile_333: If it wasn't for sod I don't think I would be playing wow
[1:54:00] ashraf_ma: Nah I never played cata & i'd like to try it
[1:54:00] dan_mcpherson: hand that in to the machine, and the gnome girl in gnomergan gives you the quest
[1:54:00] espi: in Gnomer, you need a grime-encrusted salvage and talk to the gnome npc
[1:54:01] DragoncakezZz: Id love mop, pvp was so fun then
[1:54:02] weird_shot: yeah cata classic is pointless
[1:54:02] emilyo97: @ndras it's awesome
[1:54:05] x_jdot: cata is the oversaturation
[1:54:05] valrash1981: Cata raids and dungeons were awesome.
[1:54:06] fridxa: remove softcore classic era
[1:54:07] CitizenDesmond: I feel like cata classic was like an expermient
[1:54:09] vak_hunt: cata straight up isn't "classic"
[1:54:11] baldanduseless: but cata leads to mop
[1:54:14] baldanduseless: which is goated
[1:54:16] drizzzyyy69: cata is good
[1:54:19] thendj: playerbase peaked in cata
[1:54:19] Tracy_83_: THE ISSUE WITH cATA IS THEY BROKE THE BARRens lol
[1:54:19] gmar_07: retail and start regular classic over
[1:54:20] TheRealPabloSanchez: SOD has been so refreshing for a casual dad gamer like myself. Retail and SOD would certainly be enough for me.
[1:54:20] tkeg: is mitch playing phase 2
[1:54:22] HoppsAlot: What makes it not considered classic?
[1:54:23] ScryerTV: CLASSIC SHADOWLANDS LETS GO
[1:54:23] MarkoIRL: lol cata 10x better then sod
[1:54:24] lnypnk: Heard cata was hard thats why no one liked it
[1:54:24] gambleragain: oh no...players are gonna play Cata and not the game i like...
[1:54:25] Ryzehx: Cata was decent, MoP is good.
[1:54:25] adamanttv101: money
[1:54:25] Mico027: Some people are subbed just to play some specific version of wow, if that specific version didnt exist, they just wouldnt play wow at all
[1:54:25] Dinomight3: AngelThump
[1:54:27] Plokoon100: AngelThump
[1:54:27] The_RightTwix: Cata classic was likely in development before they saw how bad Wrath performed toward the end... so might as well release it
[1:54:28] uncred95: cata is 1 step closer to mop
[1:54:28] dadbanger1: they know people are gonna play it either way
[1:54:29] DragoncakezZz: I agree MOP was goatted
[1:54:29] fetza108: mop is one of the best expansio though
[1:54:30] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: i started in cata way back when and cata was not well received
[1:54:30] Saberix69: How is SoD guys? I haven't touched classic in a long time
[1:54:30] MarcIvert: I Loved cata
[1:54:31] thesirganks: mop was garbage
[1:54:31] zerozuckerl: @vak_hunt tru its cata
[1:54:32] ndras: cata it self is good pve pvp but wotlk was even better, look what it turned out to be with gdkp n stuff
[1:54:35] fyeefyee: I’m playing cata just for rated battlegrounds
[1:54:37] CitizenDesmond: @drizzzyyy69 Why do you hate the land of azeroth
[1:54:37] DobsonWireless: dude I just did tailoring quest line for helmet it is soooo long booty bay, gnomeregan, feralas, taneris
[1:54:37] baldanduseless: @thesirganks L
[1:54:41] ndras: let it die blizz
[1:54:42] x_jdot: @MarkoIRL KEKW nah son
[1:54:42] lnypnk: Mop = rise of xaryu
[1:54:43] emilyo97: cata mop wod legion
[1:54:44] cutexlol_: but cata classic is "neccessary" for the perfect version of the game: Mists of Pandaria
[1:54:44] BoonesHQ: showing your xarCoC in the bank again?
[1:54:46] StripSniper: They added token to Wotlk now if they close the servers people invested real money into the characters and gold, not a good look
[1:54:51] julienb95: After mop the game became garbage imo
[1:54:52] dan_mcpherson: grime encrusted salvage
[1:54:52] itsquetzy: if cata is just gonna be full of gdkps i aint gonna play it
[1:54:56] Hines_Ward: gnomer
[1:54:56] codyl1m: inside gnomer
[1:54:57] tylerran34: you have it
[1:54:57] ScryerTV: gnome
[1:54:57] dan_mcpherson: then go to gnomer
[1:54:58] lightninfury: Gnomer
[1:54:59] espi: in gnomer, talk to the NPC when you have grime-salvage
[1:54:59] kamwryn: u have techbot item in your bag
[1:55:01] cryptoraven2: i think its time for WoW 2. Same difficulty, things to explore and much better graphics. Retail feels milked and the same.
[1:55:02] big_bang_impact: Yep gnomer
[1:55:04] bubblesthebelfwarrior: buy a  grim encrusted
[1:55:04] dan_mcpherson: not the ring

[3:55:10] lordkanwulf: @Xaryu SER ARE YOU PLAYING MELEE HUNTARD??
[3:55:10] romanisroamin: You don't even want that staff. Evil genius hits harder
[3:55:11] its_Blocky: dawg im a healer and i passed on that shit to another healer, and i'd pass to a mage/druid that wanted it
[3:55:12] CitizenDesmond: @Xaryu Druids have arcane spells also
[3:55:13] zerozuckerl: you cant deny bis rolls bro
[3:55:13] its_Blocky: fuck that lol
[3:55:13] CIamzy: ARCANE MAGE PRIO
[3:55:14] KoLipTic: not holy pallys
[3:55:14] BurtMan69: youd want healing MH and OH
[3:55:16] whiteiceog: dagger and healing OH is better
[3:55:17] sullyman13: its really good for hunters too
[3:55:18] Madmaxx777: does chronostatic double dip on the arcane damage and then the flat healing?
[3:55:18] joedestiny: unfortunately that is the BIS
[3:55:19] xOutcoldx: I agree wearing that as priest sucks
[3:55:19] nwjames1310: Epic dagger is bis for resto druid
[3:55:19] BurtMan69: get may more HSP
[3:55:19] typer___iban: ?? i bet they are annoyed it has
[3:55:19] Reaperz_kinetic: wait did that just drop?????
[3:55:20] Nonprophetx: thats how hunters felt last phase with the crossbow going to every melee
[3:55:22] swifty1116: Is boomy arcane damage?
[3:55:22] AdamAnt7: so so wrong the staff drom bfsd is same spell damage LUL
[3:55:23] orphesis: mage heals for sure. arcane damage and healing. what more could you ask for
[3:55:23] Kibekat: Dagger + Offhand is bis for all healers except mages
[3:55:23] KairuruTV: its bis for healer, but its still caster prio
[3:55:24] Gr8MooglyGoogly: Half the biss for shamans is cloth shit
[3:55:24] Shakezulah22: then HR it
[3:55:25] DragoncakezZz: thats the same as the epic from BFD
[3:55:26] conradical93: it has more healing than arc damage so....
[3:55:26] Drako_Rider: need to make group with holy pallys
[3:55:26] Bahood: i am arcane mage and lost it to healer. i was mad
[3:55:28] BroodingDoob: staff is not bis for druid heals, but is for priest heals
[3:55:28] Seabrax: DAGGER OFFHAND IS BETTER FOR LITERALY EVERYONE STOP COPING CHAT
[3:55:28] hclark0: its just pixels, roll on the staff bro
[3:55:29] xelarator12: Rdruid uses main hand + offhand and not a staff
[3:55:29] KonigCactusbat: It screams resto druid
[3:55:30] themadfeltcher: but arcane mage IS healer
[3:55:30] nwjames1310: Druid does arcane damage
[3:55:31] YzieGG: NE priest has starshards KEKW
[3:55:31] CwyLoL: @swifty1116 its mostly nature
[3:55:32] veiloflonelystars: arcane mage and boomie
[3:55:32] grantgatz: arcane mage is HEALER THO LOL
[3:55:32] AdamAnt7: same from bfd LUL
[3:55:32] LJimbox: damnit blizzard, make better gear!
[3:55:33] naturalduck: Yyes but I bet other healers would rather have keltis
[3:55:33] luamsp: isnt that not even that good for arcane when the BFD epic staff is also 26 spell damage
[3:55:34] ultimoos: Discrimination Madge
[3:55:35] t2ther2theav: but it’s even more bis for arcane mage 😂
[3:55:35] Yhcnalb: the other SP is heal only so i dont get the hold up
[3:55:35] yottzilla: it's bis but if arcane mage is in group, they should have prio
[3:55:36] NareeM: xar if you dont take the staff im unsubbing
[3:55:36] 775anthonymike: mages heal threw arcane dmg and thats why its on there......
[3:55:38] typer___iban: I bet they don't l;ike the Arcane either lol.....
[3:55:39] Reaperz_kinetic: nah that is mage prio 100000% my guild already said as soon as it drops it’s mine over everyone else
[3:55:40] veiloflonelystars: boomie too
[3:55:41] fedskii: @Xaryu it has to have arcane damage to account for arcane healing mages... thats why its BIS for ALL hhealers (minus pallys ofc)
[3:55:43] Mico027: Just roll good
[3:55:44] gali5656: that guys bags were full
[3:55:47] Vaggeh: "an arcane mage" Kappa
[3:55:47] naturalduck: Keltis staff is better for other healers tbh
[3:55:47] DragoncakezZz: thats the same Spell DMG as the epic from BFD
[3:55:48] shpunkgaming: just take it stfu
[3:55:49] RoaminIrl: I bet if you ninjad every piece you would not lose any viewers so whocares
[3:55:50] Canno92: Wait Xar, isn't it just a DPS loss for you? you have 26 spell damage for all
[3:55:50] Bluptuous: what does soft LC mean
[3:55:51] andypandynz: why are u pugging raids and doing loot logic as if its a guild run? nobody in the raid cares who its optimal for
[3:55:52] SpaceCowboy0811: it is not Boomy BiS
[3:55:52] Seline88: How much dmg BFD epic staff?
[3:55:52] macjcool: if you prio lvl 40 loot ima bail
[3:55:52] bramicmar: mage or druid staff or gtfo
[3:55:56] isFeyz: @Xaryu you need to consider yourself a healer, the staff is literally a mage healer + normal healer staff, that's why it has arcane damage, not because of arcane dps.
[3:55:56] typer___iban: HUH
[3:55:56] TheNJV: I think its hunter prio Xaryu. It increases arcane shot damage
[3:55:56] Nimbus723: isn't the healing mace + healing off hand better?
[3:55:57] merrinator: I won it as priest over an arcane mage Sadge
[3:55:58] angelc843: False
[3:55:58] shpunkgaming: Druid = nature dam
[3:55:58] Blkmrkt1: healing doesnt apply to arcane mage
[3:55:59] Biggydiggs: 1 hander plus off hand or sheild is better for healers, if people are saying its their BiS it is due to them being bad at math and being purple greedy @Xaryu
[3:55:59] merrinator: It's priest BIS too
[3:55:59] KoLipTic: arcane heal bis
[3:56:00] angelc843: not with the new runes
[3:56:01] Bluptuous: what does soft LC mean?
[3:56:02] jujujay_myalias: You realise that arcane dmg = + healing for mages right? It literally is a BIS staff for all healers including mage
[3:56:03] Garden_Gnome000: inspect it
[3:56:04] angelc843: and the buff
[3:56:06] KonigCactusbat: Resto druid using Moonfire and its dot.
[3:56:07] MONNlBLAST: Healing doesnt work for mage, only for mass regen
[3:56:07] pmanfit91: Mainhand/offhand is BiS for healers.
[3:56:07] SpaceCowboy0811: Dagger + STV OH is boomy BiS @Xaryu
[3:56:07] typer___iban: ?????
[3:56:08] SuaSponte: no they dont, like 70% of their damage is arcane
[3:56:09] xOutcoldx: it is priest bis , but i hate that it is lol
[3:56:10] PeeDub1969: the new nerfs require you use both
[3:56:13] sourchtv: starfire is your rotation
[3:56:14] DragoncakezZz: @Xaryu thats the same Spell DMG as the epic from BFD
[3:56:15] typer___iban: SS+SF is boomkin rotation
[3:56:16] bergen92: resto druids use starsurge
[3:56:19] ballerdeluxe: heal power does almost nothing for mage, so the staff is hardly better than sleepwalker
[3:56:19] ferreiraxdtv: not if its a pve boomkin
[3:56:19] Bluptuous: what does soft LC mean???
[3:56:21] Deatharmor98: everyones an expert in this chat
[3:56:22] MONNlBLAST: @Xaryu Only regen and mass regen applies healing power so its not that good
[3:56:22] Kibekat: even got the rez
[3:56:23] abledthunder: WG doesnt scale well with plus healing
[3:56:23] fedskii: You could not be more wrong lmao
[3:56:24] PeeDub1969: you have to use arcane to get procs
[3:56:24] simoensays: Starfire prio in rotation
[3:56:27] Keyphor158: its boomie, arcane mage and all healers
[3:56:31] anheroes: hunter staff for arcane shot and healing for mend pet imo
[3:56:32] themadfeltcher: I'm kind of excited for 40 man group comps, Boomies in caster groups, Spriests in tank groups, all teh debuffs on the boss
[3:56:33] typer___iban: ss+sf is boomkin rotation, WG is offheals because dotting isn't woirth it
[3:56:34] andypandynz: ur pugging raids bis is bis u arent playing together trying to get optimal loot for a guild group or anything
[3:56:34] capitallius: yeah. sunfire is nature, and they lose sunfire to take wild growth
[3:56:35] angelc843: SS+SF is the new moonkin rotation with the 80% dmg buff
[3:56:37] Slabzzzzzzzz: you run Wild Growth ans SS
[3:56:37] sourchtv: starfire-starsurge-doublewrath-repeat
[3:56:38] Dinomight3: @anheroes Fax
[3:56:38] zachh_93: boomy is nearly all arcane dmg
[3:56:41] macjcool: Wild growth slot has nothing good, every druid plays it. You use Arcane for everyting except fillers
[3:56:41] Seabrax: DAGGER OFFHAND WINS XAR
[3:56:43] NomarOgg: yeah but for mages it increases the healing through thee damage, its actually bis
[3:56:45] normageqq: healing power useless for arcane
[3:56:48] PushnPinkz: The weirdo Boomie players are jsut trolling bro.. Thats 1000% arcane mage, the double dip is over 50+ sp
[3:56:53] Aerah99: gual just yoinkin it all
[3:56:53] veiloflonelystars: just make it spread out to 1 person per raid
[3:56:56] Thrively: that’s 40 gold
[3:56:56] DragoncakezZz: thats the same Spell DMG as the epic from BFD
[3:56:59] firststagepizza: can't you just give them 1 to each at this point lol
[3:56:59] OT4200: Moonkin has epic dagger better
[3:56:59] naturalduck: Chat is Kappin 90% of players would rather take Kelris
[3:56:59] TurtleHoptv: loot ban that guy
[3:57:00] batchestspam: thats why u wait til end and pass them around to everyone
[3:57:01] rxr407: when you roll 100 you at least double your rolls
[3:57:05] drenipikaboo: can you please link the music on your background, looks so relaxing
[3:57:06] regularpers: just distribute at the end of tthe raid
[3:57:07] Goodyfella: you dont roll even over 2 for yourself
[3:57:12] SuaSponte: you cant double dip that staff, the healing from damage isnt affected byu +healing
[3:57:12] Goodyfella: change the dices
[3:57:13] davepyo: If an item is BiS then it’s Bis, even if better even still for arcane mage
[3:57:14] veiloflonelystars: the way i do it is each person can have the chance of geting 1 and after that they don't get no more
[3:57:15] Nimbus723: do mage heals double dip on the damage and also healing?
[3:57:16] pmanfit91: If you're a healer taking that staff over the main hand and offhand, you're wrong.
[3:57:18] douqlask: boom bis
[3:57:21] SpaceCowboy0811: it is not boomy BiS
[3:57:23] shpunkgaming: HUNTER WEP > ROG WAR USE TOO
[3:57:24] Kibekat: The dagger + offhand is 40+ healing power
[3:57:25] DragoncakezZz: thats the same Spell DMG as the epic from BFD!
[3:57:25] Bahood: all i was saying is i lost it and i was warning you LUL
[3:57:26] PoMsN: buck foomkin on that staff
[3:57:26] OT4200: Moonkin has better dagger epic
[3:57:27] CwyLoL: dagger is boomy bis
[3:57:28] unreliable6969: better for me, so mine
[3:57:29] bullbabear: just bad design by blizzard tbh
[3:57:30] Blkmrkt1: You heal through Damage but HHealing Power doesnt apply to your heals
[3:57:31] naturalduck: It's basically +50 healing for arcane
[3:57:33] themadfeltcher: Looks like hunter loot imo
[3:57:34] NawtyTyme: ya but the staf u have not has more damage and healing on it
[3:57:36] taistelija23: dagger
[3:57:37] sbaldwin9__1: everyone knows thats a warrior staff duh
[3:57:37] savagedabs4623: its like hunter weap going to rogue
[3:57:37] shpunkgaming: HUNTER GET RANGED PRIO  MAGE GETS ARCANE PRIO
[3:57:37] andypandynz: @Xaryu why do u have the logic that pugs care if its better for u or noy? bis is bis and u arent playing with the again
[3:57:37] pmanfit91: Check link from Sabere.
[3:57:41] luamsp: theres a mace
[3:57:41] calm_palm_tree: all of the caster dps want the dagger tho
[3:57:42] Nimbus723: gear mender mace and repair manual
[3:57:43] luamsp: for healers
[3:57:44] BurtMan69: No the mace and repair
[3:57:44] fedskii: @pmanfit91 you're wrong.
[3:57:46] Reaperz_kinetic: @pmanfit91 not for arcane mage heals LMFAO
[3:57:47] Trav_Where: for resto it's gear mender's mace MH
[3:57:47] Vinosity: @xaryu mage quest offhand is BIS
[3:57:47] NormanBates420: yepp true
[3:57:48] Dynamike_: blood moon off hand
[3:57:48] Bahood: glimmer with celestial orb from dustwallow quest
[3:57:48] bramicmar: you should distribute those salvages evenly man
[3:57:49] BurtMan69: Mace
[3:57:51] xOutcoldx: no spirit
[3:57:52] typer___iban: 19 sp + 41 healing lol
[3:57:52] LJimbox: ya, just wait around and RNG TWO pieces of gear
[3:57:52] HeyImDrauhgur: celestial orb for mages is bis offhand!
[3:57:52] Gr8MooglyGoogly: The necro Gnomicon
[3:57:54] Sgt_TBag: Necrobook
[3:57:55] MONNlBLAST: MAGE QUEST OH AND epic dagger
[3:57:55] narbih: wowhead says the staff isnt bis for mages
[3:57:56] m4w_13: offhand from grubbis

[3:57:57] OT4200: Bloodmoon offhand
[3:57:59] lightninfury: The necro gnomicon
[3:57:59] Seabrax: Anyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 😂
[3:58:00] NormanBates420: staff is dogshit
[3:58:01] pmanfit91: Gear-Mender's Mace

[3:58:05] samm8te: 100
[3:58:05] YzieGG: KEKW
[3:58:05] DragoncakezZz: thats the same Spell DMG as the epic from BFD!!
[3:58:06] conradical93: no, you want stats over +healing. staff is bis
[3:58:07] calm_palm_tree: prio the dagger to caster. prio staff to healers
[3:58:10] fedskii: LMAO man i wish it dropped. ITS HEALER BIS

[3:58:32] chefshefko: its gonna be hilarious when it actually drops this raid
[3:58:32] swifty1116: Is loot threshold on epic? Just seen a green
[3:58:33] morat_g: There's a healer mace too
[3:58:34] KairuruTV: STOP USING WOWHEAD FOR BIS LISTS PEOPLE
[3:58:34] andypandynz: why the fuck would pugs care if its better for you? you are in a guild run you wont see these guys again, bis is bis
[3:58:37] macjcool: troll af
[3:58:37] PassTheSwisher: Mindsets like that are what ruined the game...keep gatekeeping stuff
[3:58:37] nilleman1: Anyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 😂
[3:58:38] chiief: :feAnyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 😂

[3:58:51] shpunkgaming: W RAKE
[3:58:52] jujujay_myalias: + healing doesn't affect mage healing
[3:58:53] shpunkgaming: W TAKE
[3:58:54] themadfeltcher: how many epics you seen in gnomer so far?
[3:58:55] shpunkgaming: W RIZZ
[3:58:55] Trav_Where: why is he only reading the people's comments that are wrong on bis
[3:58:55] PushnPinkz: Boomies got nerfed and suck anyway, mage prio for all SP gear honestly
[3:58:58] zych22: w
[3:59:01] Zerkon24: @xaryu just like shadowmourne, its bis for pala, dk and warr… but that armor pen its really the best on warr
[3:59:01] davepyo: ok so the staff is actually not BiS for healers - that’s it then
[3:59:02] Muckbot1: HR it.
[3:59:06] Griezyy: Anyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 😂
[3:59:08] iamabirdttv: i have seen all of them
[3:59:10] amp2011: moon2FAT
[3:59:11] MattOriginal: Just hard reserve it before the run then, so no drama
[3:59:11] iamabirdttv: except the axe and gun
[3:59:12] reallyeric: what are parses?
[3:59:13] Bluptuous: i got my ring from my first gnomer
[3:59:16] PassTheSwisher: Mindsets like that are what ruin the game...keep gatekeeping stuff
[3:59:17] morat_g: 1h heal mace over dagger for priests right??
[3:59:17] docfreeman1: last boss always gives you one
[3:59:18] BoonesHQ: I thought the staff was a hunter weapon, arcane shot
[3:59:22] orphesis: it’s 100% either arcane mage or boomy. not good or BiS for any other caster.
[3:59:24] isFeyz: But mages don't double dip, no? They only get healing from thier damage, and that doesn't scale with +healing so you don't get double the benefit.
[3:59:24] Koi90: Just HR staff when you make group so people don't cry
[3:59:25] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[3:59:26] Corwynn_2: 2 handed axe also
[3:59:27] Shake4L: i lost it to a moonkin @Xaryu even when i won the roll with 95
[3:59:33] morat_g: The neck
[3:59:37] CrewcutChuck: 2h axe dropped
[3:59:37] chri095k: anyone seen the fist weapon?
[3:59:38] RSN_Thicc_Dylf: any wipes today?
[3:59:40] Shake4L: the MS said that it wasnt bis for me
[3:59:43] yellowgaiden: isn't this your 3rd run
[3:59:44] Reaperz_kinetic: @shake4l NO SHOT
[3:59:47] Shake4L: yup
[3:59:50] themadfeltcher: LOOT COUNCIL ASSEMBLE
[3:59:51] CitizenDesmond: bro what did he just sayu
[3:59:53] Reaperz_kinetic: @shake4l are you arcane mage???????
[3:59:56] romanisroamin: It could be worse... First gnomer I ran I was forced into fire mage from arcne and then the staff dropped and guild wouldn't let me roll because it was "offspec"
[3:59:58] theam_13: theam_13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:59:59] Joxtirol: i saw a mount today it's not epic but it's feel like it
[3:59:59] yellowgaiden: he got gas lighted
[3:59:59] Bahood: i only straight lost my roll but i shjouldnt have had to roll againat anyone
[4:00:05] sourchtv: i mean im boomkin but staff isnt is for me either. dagger + offhand is better
[4:00:08] Giovnchi: oo
[4:00:09] Shake4L: i was fire at the time but slotted for arcane in that same guild run eventually
[4:00:11] typer___iban: people deciding loot for eachother in a pug TrollDespair
[4:00:12] Goodyfella: run it with guild random groups are always risky
[4:00:13] daschadwick: why roll then lol
[4:00:14] MongoSecurity: Darkmoon fair!
[4:00:15] yashatheboi: I'm a priest and I don't want that shit staff
[4:00:20] fedskii: @Xaryu +healing on a mage only benefits direct healing. So you're not really double dipping except for the target you channel heal on.. which obv you rarely do. They had to add arcane dmg to allow healing mages to benefit from the HEALING WEAPON which is BIS for all healers.
[4:00:22] naturalduck: That staff is not bis for anyone but arcane
[4:00:22] MarkyOchoa: staff dropped for me and literally no one wanted it.. not the healers and not the arcane mage
[4:00:23] andypandynz: @typer___iban exactly bro its so dumb
[4:00:24] Witality: feet boss PepeLaugh
[4:00:28] yashatheboi: That staff is 100% arcane mage
[4:00:29] LJimbox: dagger + offhand IS better for sure, but thats 2 items you need to drop, if ever
[4:00:29] Blkmrkt1: Healing Power doesnt apply to Arcane Heal no?
[4:00:32] CitizenDesmond: Ya its weird loots rolls hardly even matter

[4:00:35] gregfork: Should put burnout on then for 15% crit
[4:00:39] LilTaisu: @fedskii ^^
[4:00:43] Ervill1: people will say anything to justify ninja, next week theyll say something else that favors them
[4:00:43] Reaperz_kinetic: @shake4l I’d G quit… my guild told me as soon as it drops it’s going straight to me… nobody else is even allowed to roll on it it’s just going to me
[4:00:44] Koi90: Priest can 1 healing first 3 bosses easy @xaryu
[4:00:44] Shway13: hunter staff for mend pet

[4:00:58] gregfork: Put burnout on @Xaryu
[4:00:59] voteforpedro064: that staff is decent for boomie pvp, but not in raid.
[4:00:59] ballerdeluxe: it's not even bis for arcane mage, right? dagger + offhand more sp
[4:00:59] CIamzy: That's a hunter arcane shot weapon
[4:01:01] killanyoux: xar gets staff
[4:01:04] Jumballaya: pretty sure they created that staff with mage healers in mind
[4:01:04] ipntheshower: Hunter cause arcane shot KEK

[4:01:19] davepyo: Guild runs is where loot becomes so relaxed. You know you’ll get whatever soon
[4:01:20] Waacka_: well your next roll is gonna be huge since you rolled a 2
[4:01:20] calm_palm_tree: so you’d rather the healers roll on the dagger that’s better for dps ?
[4:01:24] andypandynz: imagine joining a pug raid and the raid leaders logic on loot is who it gives more power to, in a pug lmao when u wont see anyone again LUL
[4:01:25] Vesir_1: could just change the loot so you only master loot blues and up
[4:01:31] mungas1: it’s not a cone

[4:01:38] Trav_Where: look at feet not upper body
[4:01:39] bullbabear: @xaryu this is what he looks like from the front fyi
[4:01:39] zerozuckerl: can we get a prediction on you getting knocked? Kappa
[4:01:39] theam_13: staff was made like that just to group the roll with all the healers, arcane dmg is just there to make it viable for mage healers

[4:01:53] voteforpedro064: Its decent for boomie pvp cause the stam/heal/arcane.
[4:01:53] Bahood: not coping, i was just warning you LUL
[4:01:57] MarkyOchoa: I'm not a fan of magic specific damage so I passed on the staff.

[4:01:57] saquon_barkley: all good
[4:01:59] PoDee_: His cone will always shoot out in the direction his feet are pointing
[4:02:00] iamabirdttv: @Griezyy facts, just got 3pc on druid last night hell yeah
[4:02:01] encrypteddeath: if you can see between his feet. so like 2 feet you could be getting hit
[4:02:08] cambridge114: @naturalduck doesn't matter, the overall is better from the staff right
[4:02:09] bondaru07: @Xaryu payo write

[4:05:04] naturalduck: To be fair you blinked into it LOL
[4:05:04] heleander: Watch me blink Kappa
[4:05:09] rxr407: you learned 2 things today though
[4:05:09] zych22: did more damage AND second in healing, but the staff shouldn’t be an arcane mage’s ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[4:05:11] tuna_sandw1ch: 3 ppl dead in raid
[4:05:11] ballerdeluxe: no way 246 is a 99

[4:05:33] macjcool: Why not just give everyone 1 of those grime things instead of rolling
[4:05:34] CrixVibez: lmfao
[4:05:34] cakeninjagaming: @reallyeric If you type in Google Warcrafftlogs its basically how much Damage/healing you do in comparison with others
[4:05:40] CIamzy: These drops
[4:05:41] gregfork: Xaryu, do you realize that you're damage parsing against healers on WCL? If you have regen on WCL assumes you are a healer.
[4:05:47] DragoncakezZz: @Xaryu Dagger off hand give more SP and the Mage of hand is basically a free Mana pot
[4:05:47] nilleman1: LUL
[4:05:50] morat_g: Based streamer
[4:05:50] madwonder: Anyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 😂
[4:05:52] fedskii: @Xaryu +healing on a mage only benefits direct healing. So you're not really double dipping except for the target you channel heal on.. which obv you rarely do. They had to add arcane dmg to allow healing mages to benefit from the HEALING WEAPON which is BIS for all healers..  copy pasta me to get the message across
[4:05:52] chadlizardd: xar spittin
[4:05:53] mazynga: myGod drama
[4:05:53] gdkpgold: priest prio

[4:05:57] zerozuckerl: Anyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 😂

[4:06:02] k1ngdyl: +healing is trash though
[4:06:04] macjcool: literally no spirit
[4:06:05] calm_palm_tree: ok now the healer just needs to roll the DPS dagger now
[4:06:07] Maehdras18: Sounds like hunter book
[4:06:10] spicyHOTPOT: Anyone tripping on the staff is insane. dagger offhand more sp for everyone aside from mage double dipping regardless you do you 󠀀

[4:06:22] fedskii: @veiloflonelystars mages dont double dip. ur wrong
[4:06:23] jbroni: you’re actually so wrong. they just added arcane so the staff worked for all healers. you’re actually trolling. spirit is so good for priest
[4:06:23] Loganlols: did the priest that just got staff win that offhand?
[4:06:24] RenogadeEU: Echo
[4:06:24] Bluptuous: what do you meaning logging?
[4:06:26] nwjames1310: + healing isn't trash in the raid it's trash in pvp
[4:06:26] LilTaisu: yeah staff is a non issue not sure why people care so much about it
[4:06:27] Kibekat: @CrixVibez i meant the dps's dmg was low, but i guess he's pugging so its normal
[4:06:37] ribas314: can you link playlist?
[4:06:39] Bluptuous: we have to log our own shit?

[4:08:02] CrixVibez: @DuckTwelve VIBING BIG DAWGGG. how you doing
[4:08:09] gregfork: If you want to parse as DPS you have to take regen off @Xaryu, otherwise you're comparing your damage against healing mages.
[4:08:11] fedskii: So crazy he wont acknowledge my message
[4:08:13] Kettopossum: LoFi Lion's Pride Inn theme now playing ;)
[4:08:18] SelWrynn: why is the dagger/orb better than the staff?

[4:09:02] dizzypeezy: @bazi2525 no
[4:09:03] Trodenskjold: So you are parsing against like 4 other people
[4:09:04] macjcool: how much of that was over healing?
[4:09:07] Seabrax: did the staff even drop? my stream was frozen when all the chaos happened
[4:09:10] Badbotqt: @knetiktv it’s not leveling, its the cap rn

[4:09:22] chadlizardd: staff debate doesnt even matter cause you'd win the roll anyways :D
[4:09:23] alexjmartens: any thoughts on doing a lil guide for this ?
[4:09:25] mopgoesham: details doesnt count overhealing
[4:09:26] fedskii: +healing on a mage only benefits direct healing. So you're not really double dipping except for the target you channel heal on.. which obv you rarely do. They had to add arcane dmg to allow healing mages to benefit from the HEALING WEAPON which is BIS for all healers..
[4:09:28] typer___iban: @Trodenskjold yes 4 logs total on warcraft logs
[4:09:28] plsnojebait: how are you able to use living flame instead of mass regen you are getting carried
[4:09:30] mopgoesham: in that displayued number
[4:09:33] Bahood: you dont worry about over heal as a mage. lol you are just slamming dmg
[4:09:38] gdkpgold: why not unboon dont you trust the raid to oneshot very boss?
[4:09:42] Bahood: nobody wants you to stop dmg cause of over heal
[4:09:46] CubicleGangster: @fedskii Mages can direct solo heal without doing damage, be quiet
[4:09:53] mo32167: healing done doesnt count overhealing
[4:09:54] hvzewrldxo: u should take 1 more dps instead that rdruid tho
[4:09:55] macjcool: @fedskii this guy fucks
[4:09:57] Seabrax: fedski you’re literally saying how he double dips without saying it
[4:09:58] RoyalBroke: lol wait there are only 4 other parses in that spec?
[4:10:00] fedskii: @CubicleGangster but how often is he? Not at all
[4:10:02] mistamang: you never unbooned last raid
[4:10:02] morat_g: 3 or 2 bosses left
[4:10:09] baddecisiondanx: @fedskii calm down bud
[4:10:09] Seabrax: basically saying it effects both ends of his healing lol

[4:13:35] anheroes: he was getting power infused and arcane powered while jumping into the altar and spamming arcane explosion
[4:13:37] PariahWretch: What class are you playing?
[4:13:44] chetterbancettv: is this the biding of isaac music?

[4:14:13] chrizzo1988: volume down of ingame sound  pls
[4:14:16] Philopinos: 5x
[4:14:23] DragoncakezZz: not since nerf
[4:14:25] Veriance: No it's terrible for healing
[4:14:25] ImmaculateSausage: 5x mass Regen tho
[4:14:35] Philopinos: they do
[4:14:38] LightYearsAhead: just enough to survive a little bit
[4:14:41] plsnojebait: 5 beacons for 1 gcd
[4:14:42] Joxtirol: i dont know if it fixed but all regen runs was connected between mages so if you got 5 mages with regen it's should be good heal
[4:14:46] DragoncakezZz: very bad -80 percent healing
[4:14:47] CubicleGangster: You only need one chrono for all mages in the group
[4:14:48] Philopinos: its like 25-35 per tick times 5
[4:14:49] Seabrax: 10-20 per target x5 mages
[4:15:02] chetterbancettv: @cakeninjagaming It sounds like the binding of isaac, the floor downpour
[4:15:14] Philopinos: i was full pve spec
[4:15:17] Philopinos: not optimal
[4:15:26] Maehdras18: Improved coc?
[4:15:31] shabomination: Frost so you can CoC Block is def the go to

[4:16:05] plsnojebait: who do you living flame tho everything dies in 2 seconds
[4:16:08] SgtPepperTTV: living flame dissapates on death and you die quickly with that strat
[4:16:13] Philopinos: @Xaryu ur thinkin u want to survive, living with 0 mana is downtime
[4:16:21] Philopinos: u just want to spawn on a grp dump mana
[4:16:25] metrohotness: xaryu are you still using the keycron keyboard? if so how is it wireless
[4:16:26] Philopinos: and die, repeat
[4:16:30] Hansumaruh: LUL
[4:16:31] voidtouched_93: warning warning
[4:16:34] gregfork: Mass Regen is mandatory if you want to parse as a healer.
[4:16:35] chadlizardd: and thats why you dont unboon lool
[4:16:38] morat_g: Electric justice!!
[4:16:49] mickster111: @Xaryu mages or not you need to play by the boss to farm more coins.  Even if it is way more chaotic
[4:17:12] Xzion129: @Xaryu You just put both healers in the back and juggle
[4:17:13] Toppers25: all melee sounds terrible last boss
[4:17:16] bergen92: hunter, priest and druid in 1 grp
[4:17:19] metrohotness: xaryu are you still using the keycron? if so how is it wireless
[4:17:20] lootmaester: just have healers move in and out
[4:17:23] bergen92: you run in and you and soak with melee
[4:17:30] mangocat40: just stay close to melee so easier for them to run in
[4:17:33] Veriance: Priest, Druid, and hunter stack for 1 arc, you then take 2nd and blink into melee, rinse and repeat
[4:17:34] romanisroamin: You have 2 groups of 2 ranged you can soak ez
[4:17:35] mylittlehombre: we did this last night full melee group we couldn’t do it but we weren’t on discord. we came close several times by baiting
[4:17:36] BroodingDoob: 2 baiters, everyoone stacks on the same side of boss in melee, then whomever gets debuff switches sides, its very easy
[4:17:37] Seabrax: no enrage take it slow and just cycle
[4:17:38] calm_palm_tree: you can do this easily. have the ranged group stack and when they get debuff the warrior runs behind them until targeted then charges the boss
[4:17:39] pmanfit91: Group 1 left side of the boss, Group 2 right side of the boss. Healers rotate in and out to spread the lightning.
[4:17:46] cakeninjagaming: Mark 1 healer and have 1 DPS run to them and Mark 2 healer aand 1 DPS run to them
[4:17:58] ElmoKnowsWhereYouLive: @xaryu There is an easy, melee friendly strat for it. 1 healer 1 side, 1 the other. 2 melee assigned on each side who just step max melee. Rest hugs just under boss.
[4:18:00] shalomski: Melee perform a semi circle around boss, have 1 range either side of boss moving in and out, will bounce to range/melee
[4:18:05] StuckStepM0m: @Xaryu Help me stepson
[4:18:15] morat_g: Would you say you're a master baiter? When it comes to this boss?
[4:18:17] ItsTavyy: pretty 5head actually
[4:18:17] Veriance: Priest, Druid, and hunter stack for 1 arc, you then take 2nd and blink into melee, rinse and repeat
[4:18:25] x_bambi9: Mark 2 Melee to stand on each side
[4:18:27] Llynok: so, Thaddius fight
[4:18:43] Dinomight3: @StuckStepM0m haHAA
[4:18:51] bald_n_gorgeous: There's someone named Xaryubank online right now trying to sell grime encrusted salvages in bulk right now lol
[4:19:07] x_bambi9: Mark 2 Melee - so they know who's group they are apart of, and have them stand opposite sides

[4:43:41] LyteKrame: you need to be on the sheep homie
[4:43:55] ikerislock: Xar going arcane for heal support?
[4:44:04] ChildishNA: stacking makes them stronger
[4:44:05] ImSo1337: Xar on sheepy

[4:44:25] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[4:44:33] Sinamun1: breath doesnt do dmg it gives debuff that does tons of dmg
[4:44:40] metalism: Stack can be bad because of overheat
[4:44:41] Nezzy243: OMEGALUL
[4:44:49] metalism: its RnG tho
[4:45:04] ikerislock: Is tank 1 tanking chicken and tank 2 squirrel and dragon? If not, that will help mit dmg
[4:45:07] LightYearsAhead: usually you tank chicken alone, and squirrel + dragon together. Chicken does the most melee damage
[4:45:15] ikerislock: ^
[4:45:23] Floknowss: since when do we listen to music here? xD

[4:45:43] Slaughter13x: Shot of whiskey now I'm ready to play some WoW boys
[4:45:46] Petr0star: stack chiken and squirrel. tank dragon alone. sheep is random. just run from it
[4:45:52] ub3rm0nk3y: i dont think theres enough cleave to worry about stacking them. you could also move dragon onto sheep during overheat and take advantage of the extra damage taken on it
[4:45:52] fanhub_: thanks man!
[4:45:59] Heynong_Man_: what are your professions? @Xaryu
[4:46:00] Zecxx: SAO u say?

[5:06:28] mangocat40: U have to camp sheep, melee cant dps it

[5:06:37] Zacrilioth: shouldn't you only focus sheep unless he spell reflects?
[5:06:37] JesseJson: Yo, the hair is lookin good man, must feel a lot better now :)
[5:06:40] dreamreamer: hunters and mage can dps sheep down
[5:06:46] inspect4: 1 tank and 2 healers should be enough for this fight
[5:06:48] LyteKrame: you can dps sheep as melee if you faps
[5:06:48] Udenwo: Group DPS is so low without casters lol
[5:06:50] LyteKrame: before you go in

[5:07:02] Frizankbeast: Gamba this one. This should be the kill Kappa
[5:07:03] gdkpgold: sheep the sheep
[5:07:12] Heavytwog: why aren’t you as a range attacking sheep whole time when not reflecting?
[5:07:13] x_jdot: these fights are night kind to melee
[5:07:18] Bluptuous: unboon soon
[5:07:20] realandtruephobe: Anyone know a fix for predictions not working?

[5:07:27] aimdawg: finally u can see what the average pug is liker
[5:07:27] ocoj: we need more hype music homie
[5:07:31] isFeyz: there's a much much more aoe damage going out in the melee group than on range, so that's definitely harder
[5:07:34] BeeMcG: bruh at level 60 raids imagine having 3 tanks and 37 mages, every raid will be easy
[5:07:34] jam1son: EASY MODE STRAT: ranged on sheep, melee instant kills chicken and keeps it dead for about 2-3 resses. it removes most of the raid damage from chickens lust. the fight will last longer but you can mitigate about 40% of raid damage that way
[5:07:38] Bluptuous: unboon when you get very close
[5:07:39] clabbee: Bring down every mob to 20%, then split up to take em to 5% and then finish them off
[5:07:40] KosmicDevil_: @jam1son no ranged
[5:07:41] Zacrilioth: i believe
[5:07:45] dreamreamer: Last boss is easier then 5th imo
[5:07:45] kirk_hunts: this fight harder than last fight imo
[5:07:54] magimannen33: u ever raid as fire
[5:07:54] doctor_anoos: how do i get to the hinterlands from org mr. xaryu
[5:07:55] kirk_hunts: you'llget more value with boss uptime with unbooning on this
[5:07:56] Heavytwog: why aren’t you as a range attacking sheep whole time when not reflecting?
[5:07:57] mrbluesky1337: nice beats
[5:08:00] direwolf575: xar have you tried fire spec with the arcane missle rune? might be decent for mana
[5:08:04] kirk_hunts: than when your melee is running pushing buttons
[5:08:04] adam_brisbane: are the hunters using aoe like carve and explosive shot?
[5:08:07] shpunkgaming: i jsut cleared my ass so u better kill
[5:08:12] KosmicDevil_: @doctor_anoos go to hillsbrad and run up to hinterlands
[5:08:19] doctor_anoos: ty! @KosmicDevil_
[5:08:24] Cross86: if last boss is new to people. it make more sense to use world buffs now. on a boss they do know
[5:08:28] Hebro420: saving boon for next raid

[5:31:36] captaincrozbow: close gamba
[5:31:49] royalblood49: is it possible to one shot the boss before he goes back in
[5:31:56] Darmonocis: not even using new legs
[5:31:57] MadMiike123: I'm about to lvl 25, should i try to find a group for bfd or just keep leveling to 40 ?
[5:32:03] deelay0: caster raid gear sucks
[5:32:04] MadMiike123: to lvl up*
[5:32:07] YzieGG: karma KEKW
[5:32:07] ohmargerd: the price of fat dam
[5:32:09] Dinomight3: @MadMiike123 bfd on CD
[5:32:13] pursuit644: stolen legs
[5:32:15] lordextraordinary: full set is -35 stamina :D
[5:32:19] RingersRealm: @MadMiike123 bfd. Lots of BIS gear and a ton of exp
[5:32:21] DeathToad007: @Darmonocis its a token
[5:32:22] Zecxx: @MadMiike123 BFD is almost a full level of xp
[5:32:26] CIamzy: Why even bother getting world buffs, I don't think you've ever used them in raid LUL
[5:32:27] BullzeyeWoW: @madmiike123 bfd gives great xp
[5:32:31] Seabrax: bfd is bis leveling
[5:32:35] Darmonocis: @DeathToad007 he bought them
[5:32:40] MadMiike123: Aight thanks boiz
[5:32:42] dana_danielle: @MadMiike123 bfd is pretty fun just in general, worth doing imo :)
[5:32:45] shpunkgaming: does bfd still have 3 day reset now?
[5:32:47] zerozuckerl: 50k believe lets goooooo
[5:32:50] Jyger: @shpunkgaming Yes

[5:32:55] randompudge: damn dps is soo low
[5:32:58] wavecadet: you have to kite
[5:33:01] wavecadet: esp when you are not pumping
[5:33:15] shpunkgaming: why grp doing bfd damage?
[5:33:19] SurrealAndre: very
[5:33:20] foolsendit: OT taunt after breath not during
[5:33:22] t1isokatleague: LOL
[5:33:29] Erbsosa: you have to kite it
[5:33:30] foolsendit: or pet
[5:33:30] keysersoze_taken: it not
[5:33:36] wavecadet: if you dont kite it tank dies
[5:33:36] Smootheeey: kite thru middle
[5:33:40] bald_n_gorgeous: brez!!!
[5:33:44] Wrestler: Tanking over there can be helpful so that the bombs take longer to get to group
[5:33:45] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: just plan the path for them to kite
[5:33:47] moosywow: pally should only bubble the stacks after the 1st phase
[5:33:49] ikerislock: Kite from pillar to pillar. Straight across
[5:33:50] wavecadet: HOW he is kiting is a diff story
[5:33:53] ddevillax: are u gonna kill kha'damu
[5:33:54] shawdonda: you have to run away to avoid stacks
[5:33:57] airthayer2k16: YOU KITE IT HORIZONTAL
[5:33:59] Smootheeey: towards door then do a 180 and then towrads back of room
[5:33:59] KenOxisGSide: seems like another wipe :(
[5:34:01] LordRamAssington: you either kite over there in the open or you have to kite through potential bombs spawning
[5:34:01] airthayer2k16: BACK AND FORTH
[5:34:01] lordextraordinary: thru middle is harder if no good bomb prevetion
[5:34:02] CwyLoL: you got served!
[5:34:08] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: if the tank starts running as it is cast then they won't take any stacks
[5:34:13] Catalystic_Sudo: chat any good drops?!?!?!
[5:34:14] Trav_Where: if you don't have bombs walking around thats fine
[5:34:24] shpunkgaming: @Catalystic_Sudo 3 epics
[5:34:30] sKiMASKIi: deeps kinda slow
[5:34:37] Trav_Where: dragging melee where the bombs fall could be problematic
[5:34:44] R7SOKA: boss looks complicated, kiting bosses, buttons to click, etc.? it's not as difficult as it looks right
[5:34:45] mitsankladan: mana mana
[5:34:48] canceln: what was just said above - phase 1 kite it pillar to pillar, drag out immediiately after pull
[5:34:54] Catalystic_Sudo: I love it!! any for xar??
[5:35:01] KenOxisGSide: if you are top dps as a mage heal is deff low dps in raid
[5:35:07] Xenocide321: @R7SOKA range hit button range kill bomb  easy
[5:35:08] retnuh15: healer mana
[5:35:16] jmaurice07: when do you know to click the button
[5:35:22] royalblood49: Woah how is he healing so much??
[5:35:24] sebfrafestegnen: @kenoxisgside its hybrid
[5:35:25] retnuh15: when bombs are coming out of it
[5:35:30] Brenno_Mc: when the bombs are coming out
[5:35:31] espi: Are you winning son?
[5:35:39] KenOxisGSide: @sebfrafestegnen ohhhh
[5:35:45] lordextraordinary: I like that the feral is not DPS boss at all, because he is bomb duty
[5:35:46] canceln: gnome escape artist your stacks
[5:35:48] sKiMASKIi: use gnome racial to drop stacks
[5:35:51] Zielepoot: tank needs a shield
[5:35:53] canceln: ^^
[5:35:56] chillyt616: @Xaryu you can gnome racial stacks off
[5:36:01] chillyt616: does big dmg when he does aoe
[5:36:02] morat_g: Gnome racial
[5:36:04] AsusCom: why Hunter use explosive shot? wtf

[5:36:13] Eggzactly54: save brez
[5:36:15] retnuh15: no
[5:36:15] mitsankladan: tank pulls much dmg should equip some shield etc
[5:36:17] foolsendit: faps on 2-3 stacks would help a ton
[5:36:17] terribleyoda: in this phase, frost stacks increase coolant discharge dmg per person right? frost stacks from non tank members don't increase dmg done to tank by boss on regular attacks right? (group I'm running with thinks it does)
[5:36:18] hutchyy917: no
[5:36:19] DeathToad007: save for boon
[5:36:20] keysersoze_taken: it is 2 hardest phases done
[5:36:20] prissy_pdx: 5/6 run boissss

[5:36:48] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: if you watch the top it zaps the head were the bombs start coming out
[5:36:48] CrixVibez: @shpunkgaming Always unless you want to help AoE heal, then you take Mass
[5:36:51] paulthecat: You need a meta lock for this fight
[5:37:02] voidbrawlers: @terribleyoda stacks increase damage done to the tank yes
[5:37:14] Bluptuous: if your druids arent B ressing its just not gonna work @Xaryu
[5:37:28] terribleyoda: thanks void
[5:37:31] HDee1205: you know you one shot ystaday ye? :D hee

[5:37:36] espi: that poor priest o7
[5:37:38] shpunkgaming: aoe here might be worth tho
[5:37:40] xanaxwavvY: haha you gave it all
[5:37:41] ikerislock: Tell tank in P1: Kite straight across from pillar to pillar where the is no fence
[5:37:41] Exodyqq: Nice dps guys xddd
[5:37:41] R7SOKA: @Xenocide321 simple enough! and for all raids,  no one really knows the strategy until you just get in and try it, and run around exploring the options/mechanics i guess
[5:37:42] royalblood49: How are you healing this much??
[5:37:43] donnjj: unboon now

[5:38:07] chillyt616: boots heals is V nice
[5:38:10] vluggejaapie89: pala should use a shield instead of 2h @Xaryu

[5:39:10] cookie_jayy: haha so much free loot haha
[5:39:14] mitsankladan: pulls out a lot of dmg
[5:39:15] Zielepoot: tank taking massive damage
[5:39:18] CrixVibez: @royalblood49 Regenation and Mass regeneration are runes that you can use that heals targets, but also puts a beacon on them. Then whenever you do Arcane dmg, it will heal whoever has a beacon
[5:39:24] hutchyy917: how could the tank dying not be an issue?
[5:39:24] keeeelso: seems like a healing problem
[5:39:30] addzieh1: @disar27 melees need some love? have you seen melee hunters?
[5:39:31] morat_g: Healer mana was ripped from tank taking too much dam tho

[5:39:59] buzz97: tanking this boss without shield is kinda crazy
[5:40:02] Timpressive: melee need gear
[5:40:03] regularpers: @addzieh1 true, melee huunters are the only mmelee in the game
[5:40:13] CrixVibez: I'd prob go Mass for this. to be safe
[5:40:14] royalblood49: @CrixVibez okay cheers

[5:41:19] JayyyRS: @Air_A I think he's running PoM over homies
[5:41:20] stroobzbeats: @Xaryu why no spotify playlist in the past year or so?
[5:41:23] foolsendit: @Air_A prob PoM
[5:41:24] lordextraordinary: lordextraordinary subscribed with Prime.

[5:44:00] airthayer2k16: TANK NEEDS TO PRE POT ALL THREE PROT POTIONS BEFORE FIGHT. THEY STACK
[5:44:00] clickityclacker: if you dont kite he will die
[5:44:02] Mastapenguino: mhm
[5:44:02] Hircien: the tanki gets too many stacks if he eats the fire
[5:44:04] foolsendit: kite left to right not mid to front
[5:44:05] Mastapenguino: u trip
[5:44:06] morat_g: He should kite around pillars
[5:44:06] Brenno_Mc: they shouldn't be getting that many stacks
[5:44:06] LordRamAssington: tank cant sit still tank has to kite
[5:44:07] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: if you don't kite you get like 15 stacks
[5:44:08] Erbsosa: tank dies if he doesnt kite
[5:44:10] hotmanpop: the stacks are gonna destroy the raid no?
[5:44:12] pmanfit91: Do the BFD strat. Tank without moving, bubble the stacks off.
[5:44:12] espi: tank need to kite FAR during the ability
[5:44:14] LordRamAssington: you run risk of running into bombs during kite then
[5:44:15] cutiesxd: ur not trippin
[5:44:15] chubahi: he die if no kite
[5:44:16] canceln: positioning is wrong
[5:44:16] ikerislock: Pillar to pillar
[5:44:17] Djbunny162: If you kite, the tanks shouldnt get more then 1-3 stacks
[5:44:18] shadowvypers: most kite left to right in middle
[5:44:19] airthayer2k16: AND BLESSING OF FREEDOM DURING p2
[5:44:20] garbobean: yea middle works
[5:44:20] Mastapenguino: atround is possible
[5:44:20] CrixVibez: This is why mass regen is bis
[5:44:20] gdkpgold: @texhawk just get rid of sugar dont be too strict bout carnivore or not
[5:44:22] gregfork: you're trippin
[5:44:28] clickityclacker: he should be kitting very far
[5:44:28] zxzzzxz2000: all will get stacks then
[5:44:29] Goobadoobadoob: We usually kite back and forth by the entrance
[5:44:29] ub3rm0nk3y: the debuff is like 100damage a second. you dont want to stack and heal that
[5:44:32] daijahaden: He can, but then you need to really watch out for bombs. And it risks breathing the raid.
[5:44:35] Mastapenguino: chaotic w bombs
[5:44:38] morat_g: No ur right he should kite to pillars
[5:44:39] N3x3z: mid kiteing is to much stacks potential for raid
[5:44:42] Seline88: Kite like an 8 between the first two pillars
[5:44:42] dana_danielle: mage heals is so cool

[5:45:01] gregfork: @CrixVibez he's not actually trying to heal tho
[5:45:02] howdyhamburger: I tanked this before, the boss hits very hard
[5:45:03] KenOxisGSide: this is it!!!
[5:45:05] hotmanpop: first phase it just not the "range dps phase"
[5:45:10] aRedBean: have warrior tank p1 and intervene the fire to tank
[5:45:15] Emmsskka: hit it like u mean it
[5:45:17] kosmolson: do it
[5:45:17] CrixVibez: @gregfork Yeha I get that, but if they're wiping, might want to is all
[5:45:18] Bluptuous: when your team is all booned they expect to die, unbooning is a different  mentality @Xaryu
[5:45:22] ub3rm0nk3y: can try pet taunt during the furnace surge
[5:45:43] gregfork: @CrixVibez agreed, IMO would be better to run burnout for more damage or fully commit to the healing.
[5:45:52] clickityclacker: click buttons on cd
[5:45:52] lukemeleney: you would've needed to to go hit that button anyway
[5:45:59] ikerislock: Click again between P2-P3
[5:46:01] Clayray53: so mage heals/tops dps and heals pretty good lol? thats too OP
[5:46:02] CrixVibez: @gregfork Yeah. Or chrono. Would help a ton on the tank heals IMO

[5:46:15] foogyjenkins: clicker confirmed
[5:46:28] Daracus98: bet u missingme now
[5:46:33] gregfork: @CrixVibez for sure, just since they have so much melee feels like it'd be better to do the actual healing rotation or just do mage damage. this priest is a chad who can carry the heals himself.
[5:46:33] espi: click buttons during downtime

[5:56:07] aSteamedTomato: HPS parses depend on execution
[5:56:09] gdkpgold: you should unboon for the first 4 bosses and then reboon
[5:56:10] Djbunny162: HPS parse is a meme anyways
[5:56:11] Nimbus723: hps parse doesn't mean you're a good healer lol
[5:56:12] CrixVibez: It's dps as a healer

[5:56:17] jmaurice07: da fuck

[6:58:03] Darksyde1029: It's a step towards homogenization and removes a little piece of class unique-ness from classic. Is it better for balance? Yea. Is it good for classic? Depends on your worldview.
[6:58:12] FeelsBadWoman: @xaryu you can try to get tidal charm sometime maybe

[7:01:16] idiotferaltko: its part of the game? why would it feel odd
[7:01:17] panzerfauste02: nades are fine, potions are not. You need nades to even duel a mage on some classes

[7:03:47] Guidry: so dumb
[7:03:47] MrPankratz: its just for not using in pvp
[7:03:48] LeeDaKillerBee: The minus stamina is dumb LUL
[7:03:49] goonplot: Horde would never have helped kill the Dark Rider first ;)
[7:03:49] dernus27: dernus27 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[7:03:59] BeeMcG: its just pointless
[7:03:59] yellowgaiden: did they try to seperate it?
[7:04:03] midnightrdr: pvers are allergic to pvp so they dont care
[7:04:03] alrik_plays: its glasscannon build
[7:04:03] sketchinz: If you dont want to gear swap, thats on you LUL don't complain
[7:04:05] Execrable1: IF you were?
[7:04:06] ikerislock: Just go hyperconductive. It seems close in PvE and way better PvP
[7:04:08] Valencia_Pete: and they glow green so they are easy targets for gank LUL
[7:04:10] Ace0hSpades: @Xaryu they still gonna wear it for parses KEKW
[7:04:13] Brewnelle: Its extra gear that doesnt take up drop chance on actual set gear, its fun and cool
[7:04:13] BeeMcG: whats the point in it being - gear
[7:04:16] Bahood: and in pve no bc we get resisntance and we shouldnt get hit often anyways
[7:04:19] kaizen421: its so stupid they are trying to shoe horn in the retail mentality of having "pvp gear"
[7:04:19] illwill132: well you have 2 options for tierset for cloth
[7:04:30] Odessagurl: Having PvE gear on in the open world is more effiecient than wearing PvP gear, cause u grind faster in the long run

[7:06:38] Greyscull: @xaryu I think you're underestimating the power of the eng belt. +1 hit on belt means 1 free talent point. And the movement speed on a 15min cd is big and fun.
