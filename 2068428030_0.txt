[0:11:54] Canonlecolosse: good i wanted to make my snails wrestle each others but i wasn't sure it would be better than this stream
[0:11:56] Sebleh: well thankfully for everyone I don‚Äôt have anything better to do so we‚Äôre all stuck with me here Waiting
[0:12:00] Poringossa: Sounds like a Podcast-stream?
[0:12:02] Andersonmps: How are you today? (You're glowing today btw)
[0:12:04] Zirconn__: How much did you drink this weekend jfc
[0:12:09] jlaw_89: gmorning miss caro

[0:12:16] velarena: I‚Äôm all in for the shit talking in Valdrakken
[0:12:16] TotallyNotRaien: i did the usual, contact no human and stay in my cave
[0:12:27] velarena: like a lil Nagura podcast
[0:12:28] Sikkbass: @Andersonmps "glowing" hmmm
[0:12:35] Sebleh: I felt like an honorary Italian with the amount of pasta I cooked this weekend naguuraSip
[0:12:46] Sebleh: NA servers go down in 27 minutes
[0:12:46] jlaw_89: 28 minutes for NA servers
[0:12:52] Zirconn__: KEKW
[0:12:54] Andersonmps: LMAO
[0:12:55] Cyberkaia_: Like 30 min for NA
[0:12:55] maalcromlol: D:
[0:12:58] SneakyPauly: What was your favorite matchup for this MDI so far?
[0:13:05] Zirconn__: ‚Äú I contracted a disease that is 100% fatal in humans if not dealt with properly‚Äù
[0:13:08] Zirconn__: NICE KNOWING YOU
[0:13:15] SneakyPauly: Between the teams
[0:13:29] Zirconn__: absolute savagery
[0:13:29] Fausstty: "Get well soon" Kappa

[0:13:44] Cyberkaia_: 1st match Dawgs vs Echo was pretty sick
[0:13:58] Veritas243: 1st echo vs dawg was insane
[0:14:01] Veritas243: so close on all maps
[0:14:03] beybimochii: echo at rise...
[0:14:11] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[0:14:32] Andersonmps: That decisive BRH with dawgs and acho was crazy!
[0:14:37] Andersonmps: echo*
[0:14:42] Zirconn__: can we make ‚Äú‚Äònice knowing you‚Äù an audio point redeemer. it has unlimited potential pepePhone
[0:14:47] Babyclaws: I think Legendary saw Echo's portal strat and went full tilt
[0:14:52] Sebleh: Dawg only beat Echo because Echo fucked up
[0:14:52] brnhrtsch: is there any weak aura or macro you wish you had but dont have?
[0:15:57] Sebleh: yeah
[0:16:02] Cyberkaia_: yeah, agree
[0:16:25] alyeese: last hope really didn't stand a chance with those maps
[0:16:33] Sebleh: so they lost one match to the 4 pull AD and echo‚Äôs gateway fuckup and Rezan reset, then the 10% yalnu sanguine heal right?
[0:16:39] Babyclaws: idk why so many people were crying against boring comps lol they wanted different dps each map
[0:16:44] TotallyNotRaien: was it high stakes because of the 4th dps tho?
[0:16:45] Andersonmps: That BRH had so many death on both teams. Was crazy
[0:16:51] Sebleh: that‚Äôs literally not a route/performance issue, that‚Äôs just sudden mistakes.
[0:16:55] dandeneaux: I just think 4 DPS shouldn't be a thing but it was not boring lol
[0:17:13] Sebleh: echo‚Äôs rise for example if someone else had that routing before them it would have been incredible to see them lose to that.
[0:17:27] Morogwen: just started playin boomie and am bad so now gonna see how a good player does it
[0:17:38] Zirconn__: wrong stream for that bud
[0:17:44] TotallyNotRaien: @Morogwen watch tettles
[0:17:45] Streetside0: LOL
[0:17:48] bleep_: should the portal tech be allowed?
[0:17:59] cptdrage: would be cool if they could ban classspec aswell as dungeon
[0:18:08] Xpatrik93x: @Babyclaws because there are people who started playing wow in DF and they thing they know better then MDI guys
[0:18:13] Morogwen: @TotallyNotRaien i think he is offline :c
[0:18:17] Sebleh: priest also wasn‚Äôt brought because of PI. they were topping damage so often
[0:18:24] Standy94: Is Ret a better healer than Pres?
[0:18:40] TotallyNotRaien: what about that whole system of giving players a currency and make them buy each spec at differing prices?
[0:18:41] Babyclaws: the people wanting diff comps are warrior mains KEKW
[0:18:46] Zirconn__: people expect MDI to be a draft type LoL/DOTA2 game and it‚Äôs amazing when they get mad
[0:18:50] greatangelsanguinius: do you have a regular job outside of twitch and yt?
[0:18:56] SneakyPauly: Lol can you imagine if you had to prep your team for every possible comp xD
[0:19:02] TotallyNotRaien: shes a professional procrastinator
[0:19:11] Vanicx_EU: Or do it like AWC - the loser picks dungeon and the winner must select their comb first
[0:19:18] Kuroz: @greatangelsanguinius that's her job
[0:19:19] Andersonmps: Also the reason priest was in, is not only because PI
[0:19:37] shawshanks14: Is The Great Push coming back again?
[0:19:39] deadliftdundy: Im a little sad, that the keylvl was so low
[0:19:54] Cyberkaia_: @Zirconn__ LOL and Dota are playing the same comps too, but theuy have 150 champs,  only 20 are picked.. thats meta. Its kinda the same
[0:19:55] Kahlandra: its a speed running competition, keys can't be too high
[0:20:06] brnhrtsch: love your glasses
[0:20:06] Kahlandra: i was a broken record this weekend saying that
[0:20:27] Zirconn__: but people want to have like a ban phase for specs in each match up not realizing how boring that would be
[0:20:28] Xpatrik93x: @Naguura I think nothing proves more that you are telling if you check what comps are the BEST for finishing a 23 in the quickest time OR doing a +32 waycrest in time
[0:20:31] toxaaris: great push
[0:20:34] toxaaris: yup
[0:20:36] Andersonmps: Yeah
[0:20:37] dnfbowser: tgp is way better than mdi :(
[0:20:42] Standy94: Ya they should do 31s for MDI
[0:20:44] Sebleh: @kahlandra I just wish the keys were a little bit higher it would be better to see them push Kappa
[0:20:45] rpgonlyforme: they'll likely do 1 key higher for globals, right?
[0:20:49] dreddlock_: what level were the keys? I didn‚Äôt get to watch any
[0:20:55] Morogwen: legendary's atal run is a good example of what mdi is imho
[0:20:57] DanyKR98: DanyKR98 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[0:21:07] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[0:21:24] Kahlandra: @dreddlock_ 22-24
[0:21:25] AceReformed: naguuraSwole
[0:21:26] franblast20: @dreddlock_ They were between +22 and +24
[0:21:26] Zirconn__: ace the GOAT
[0:21:36] Standy94: The first half of TGP is pointless though. they just slam 27s
[0:21:44] Sebleh: woah no way it was your birthday this weekend?
[0:21:48] Sebleh: who could have known
[0:21:51] twootten: I like mdi for the crazy Strats, looking forward to seeing more in the coming weekends
[0:21:52] Sebleh: it wasn‚Äôt spammed anywhere
[0:22:03] Suresnipe: I like that Jacket
[0:22:07] TotallyNotRaien: theres only so many specs that go well together tho
[0:22:25] twootten: also, I think last hope did alright given that they didnt prep well. hoping NA can show up well after more prep time
[0:22:27] Xpatrik93x: @Standy94 why they should? you are telling F1 should race with trucks... its not what it's meant for
[0:22:33] Babyclaws: it would take so long for them to maste each class
[0:22:50] Zirconn__: that is a fantastic analogy @xpatrik93x
[0:22:54] Standy94: @xpatrik93x take a hint bud
[0:23:11] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers!

[0:23:51] blueshott60: please hand your quest in lol
[0:23:57] TotallyNotRaien: there would be less civilian i guess teams, cuz i figure the established teams would simply tryhard even more
[0:24:01] Sebleh: yeah that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt tried to play MDI. i could definitely beat echo if I had the time to play, it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm absolute garbage at the game and have to friends to make a team or time to practice seblehCope seblehCope seblehCope
[0:24:11] StreamElements: If you enjoy the stream make sure to check naguura out on her Socials : https://twitter.com/Naguura // https://www.youtube.com/naguura // https://www.instagram.com/naguura // tiktok.com/@naguura
[0:24:20] piquitucho__: Please deliver the weekly quest, that's triggering me :(
[0:24:29] TotallyNotRaien: sebleh you could beat them if only boomie didnt suck!
[0:24:34] Kahlandra: i could do a 31 atal sub 10 with my eyes closed, they're just handicapped with that LOW level key that my rando pug in lfg could do ez
[0:24:37] Kahlandra: /s
[0:24:46] Babyclaws: tbh dungeon design needs to be the reason for different classes and comps i think?
[0:24:49] vratko18: sorry but i cant find on discord your eluvi and weakauras im blind or i dont know :D
[0:25:02] Zirconn__: she doesn‚Äôt use elvUI
[0:25:07] AceReformed: I had a great weekend actually, I hit a new PR on the deadlift, which didnt happen for a few years because I took a little break from the gym a year back naguuraSwole @Naguura
[0:25:09] Sebleh: nah there isn‚Äôt. This game requires a deep knowledge and practice of a spec, not just a role or class. You can‚Äôt play a random spec at a high level immediately like random class variety would demand.
[0:25:20] Standy94: I do wish I could see how some melee would work but the only melee are healers apparently lol
[0:25:22] Mrjakoby2001: do you think they should rework the whole m+, affix and sign up system?
[0:25:27] Kuroz: @vratko18 connect discord to twitch in the user settings for the weakauras
[0:25:35] Sebleh: @kahlandra let‚Äôs form our own MDI team.
[0:25:44] Ren26: Rise with a Rogue? sounds like an epic novel
[0:25:46] Babyclaws: i mean they did it for SL with covenant bonuses before we could swap
[0:25:50] linguinetoes: Hello hello
[0:25:51] Parfisal: is it naive to say they should also ban a # of specs on each map?
[0:25:51] vratko18: oh okeyy thank you :D
[0:25:57] Andersonmps: Im just happy that Ret Pally is relevant again
[0:26:05] Sebleh: We‚Äôll demolish Echo so badly they won‚Äôt even know what hit them
[0:26:13] Standy94: The people pushing keys where class balance matters is like less than .1% though
[0:26:25] Zirconn__: Naguura tournament rules: every team gets an hour to complain about not getting invited to keys while running circles in Valdrakken. whichever Team bricks their key closest to the hour mark wins.
[0:26:31] Sebleh: is it me or did she just skip Teddy? Susge
[0:26:42] sim967: @vratko18 do you have twitch account linked to discord?
[0:26:55] Kahlandra: @Sebleh we don't need a team, lets just duo it. show these scrubs how to do keys
[0:26:59] TotallyNotRaien: Naguura tournament: The team that dies with their cooldowns up the most often wins
[0:27:01] Stovepov: facts
[0:27:18] SneakyPauly: Stream practices? But then day 1 routes would be the same i think haha
[0:27:20] Sebleh: @kahlandra hell yeah let‚Äôs go
[0:27:23] Freestyle20: the standard viewer is just interested in seeing their fav class played and somehow that will help them in game
[0:27:26] Sebleh: @stovepov big fan btw
[0:27:29] josecho76: The work they've put in to the route, skips etc.
[0:27:29] sim967: true, but you help with that @naguura
[0:27:37] Andersonmps: Its bc its all seems too easy. But its seems that way bc of the effort of the teams
[0:27:43] Cyberkaia_: teams practice a pull hundres of times, the complex on coordinate kick for every single pull, on wholer dungeons its brutal
[0:27:45] Standy94: They should have random dungeons and not let them practice just to see what they come up with in the fly
[0:27:46] artmansh: Isnt this a wow issue in general though? PVE and PVP. To many details to track and learn to understand what is happening
[0:27:46] Xpatrik93x: @Naguura do you remember your story when you were called Elitist? YOu expect THOSE people to understand the effort MDI players put into the game :D
[0:28:31] Babyclaws: do you think group B will steal the portal strat from Echo now?
[0:28:49] Standy94: I thought they just Natty that rise portal thing that run
[0:28:55] TotallyNotRaien: you would have to practice every dungeon for every pull with all the spec combinations
[0:29:18] Sebleh: you know what‚Äôs funny? I saw some people on Reddit saying you were brutal for mentioning that Some Seriousness had never done above +20 before MDI like you were burning them instead of praising them for how well they adapted.
[0:29:36] Zirconn__: naguura community tournament: team with the lowest average item level wins
[0:29:41] Standy94: Naguura confirms chat is dumb. clip it
[0:29:42] there_is_only_war: Yeah, the system from now won't work anymore. You just don't preplan everything anymore
[0:30:14] there_is_only_war: if bans would exist
[0:30:17] Parfisal: i undestand they build their choreographed dance around all available specs, but if they knew ahead of time, they could think about that and become a more robust team, maybe not have super specialized strats but have different options depending on the class bans, might also improve the experience for competitors since they dont feel like they need to squeeze every tech out of the best specs
[0:30:17] Standy94: I‚Äôm just waiting for the Fort/Sang/Bolster TGP dungeon
[0:30:25] nomnok: if something is so broken that it has to be banned. Dont all contestants then have the problem of that?
[0:30:41] Sebleh: @parfisal you just increase the practice time like that and the current rules are made to reduce practice time
[0:30:48] Kahlandra: @Parfisal i think this would make the competitor experience horrible
[0:30:52] Standy94: Can we get rid of Incorp and afflicted?
[0:30:54] Sebleh: you don‚Äôt even know how much degen practice time they used to play before
[0:31:13] mathguydave: I think there was a keystone masters where each player could only play each spec once ?
[0:31:23] Kahlandra: one of the biggest competitor complaints was the amount of time needed to practice compared to competition time, the mdi was adjusted to make it easier for them
[0:31:24] Sebleh: they‚Äôve literally cut down on TR time for player health and reduce ‚Äúpreferential treatment‚Äù of career streamers who can play all day
[0:31:41] Zirconn__: people really be thinking MDI teams play casual player hours
[0:31:47] sim967: @sebleh are you saying redditers jumped to conclusions and conveyed toxicity?
[0:31:55] Standy94: I +2 a 23 on live. I could probably do MDI
[0:32:02] Kahlandra: to expect them to play so many classes at a very high level on the fly is unreasonable
[0:32:12] deadliftdundy: @Standy94 If you do the dungeon in 11 minutes, yeah. maybe xD
[0:32:19] Kahlandra: and to expect them to practice the "what ifs" is even more unerasonable
[0:32:21] Standy94: shh
[0:32:31] dnfbowser: dh havoc
[0:32:52] Standy94: We know all the players too. you would just ban one persons characters and brick the team
[0:32:58] Cyberkaia_: a lot of teams can play TGP, but MDI , its not the same.
[0:32:59] Babyclaws: yeah people just want to see more classes
[0:33:14] TotallyNotRaien: warriors just want to see their class
[0:33:17] Parfisal: i personally dont think seeing the same comp against the same comp is an issue, but may not be the majority
[0:33:17] theskot: people love it when the game starts and its a weird class or comp
[0:33:21] cptdrage: was quite difference in comp this weekend
[0:33:25] Sebleh: the funniest thing is people who argue for class variety don‚Äôt understand that TR players just /who and copy comps then figure out what must be good about it
[0:33:25] Zirconn__: but it‚Äôs also the wow community, even if you give them what they want, they will still bitch and moan
[0:33:27] Parfisal: but thanks for the insight on my thoughts!
[0:33:27] Andersonmps: Ppl its just mad that their classes are on the competition
[0:33:32] Standy94: Blizz should ban WW just saying
[0:33:36] wow_revan: @Naguura Why don't we see Devoker? No team plays it. Weak specs for a tournament?
[0:33:37] Kahlandra: @Zirconn__ truth
[0:33:37] Andersonmps: Are not*
[0:33:41] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[0:33:43] Utinis: Would have to make the picks like they do in league, but it could become very unbalanced
[0:33:59] KegzyTv: I think it would be a fun bit to have a separate comp that teams have to "draft" their classes.
[0:34:08] TotallyNotRaien: deep down shes calling yall idiots, dont listen to her
[0:34:10] Zirconn__: then that wouldn‚Äôt be MDI lol

[0:34:17] Morogwen: i just marge simpson meme mdi, i just think its neat
[0:34:26] Standy94: This MDI is way better than the last one
[0:34:28] ItsUrBuddyJake: Depends on the purpose of MDI is viewership and entertainment or just pure min max competition and speed
[0:34:36] G4L4XY9: how do you feel about 4 dps comps?
[0:34:39] Parfisal: i personally enjoyed this weekend as it is, wanted to get more of your thoughts on those suggestions
[0:34:51] Stovepov: TOOBASED
[0:35:03] thundork: Heyge naguura and chat
[0:35:04] Noxx_be: Those ppl would just want a format with 2 teams go head to head with random picked char groups and a random dungeon
[0:35:18] Zirconn__: then they should play a MOBA ^ lol
[0:35:19] baphumet88: Hello, what ranged dps do you recommend with an easy rotation and good survival?
[0:35:22] PaWseN9: My only real issue with MDI has nothing to do with MDI. I hate how meta comps trickle down to everyday keys and makes it hard for "off meta specs" to get into keys.
[0:35:24] thundork: i still dont know how zaelia did all that healing while maintaining good dps
[0:35:33] Standy94: 4 dps is sadge. I literally wipe on 23s on live and they do the same pull with half the dungeon on the boss lol
[0:35:42] AlphasaurusRexx: the top players and teams are going to play the best comp. it's that way in every competitive format and sports. people want to win not, not play warrior because muh diversity
[0:35:55] viluliinaxx: BIGCAT
[0:35:59] xVTechnique: group b is lucky they just got handed a ton of strats by group A
[0:36:01] G4L4XY9: i think 4 dps comps just prove how good these mdi players are haha
[0:36:05] TotallyNotRaien: oh right shes doing keys
[0:36:12] puntualus: resto druid dps is based naguuraSwole
[0:36:27] Zirconn__: yeah somethings wrong, we have some keys in the middle of our valdrakken stream
[0:36:32] quzulu: dont think there should be any spec restrictions. if they want to force healers they should adjust class/dungeon balance so its not as viable
[0:36:59] TotallyNotRaien: they should just say fuck it a pull an overwatch
[0:37:01] Grohma_: Grohma_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:37:01] umarebep: I think that the layout of the tournament needs a change. Like for example making 3 teams go against each other instead of 2. So if 1 team makes a mistake you still need to worry about the other.
[0:37:06] josecalp: Hi, talents three plz
[0:37:06] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[0:37:11] Zirconn__: off to a meeting that can be an email, bbl
[0:37:16] Standy94: I think ret heals more than pres anyway
[0:37:18] Kuroz: talents are top left
[0:37:28] Freestyle20: JB would want to force a healer ;d
[0:37:29] bleeppblorpp: yeah if the tuning wasn't so f-ed teams would bring healers
[0:37:31] thundork: that would make it stale imo, no restrictions leaves it open to fun strats
[0:37:45] theskot: i like it when the 4 dps looks like its hard. when its 4 dps and health bars barely move its a little meh
[0:37:47] Ok_Kingston: 4 dpos is a bad game state
[0:37:52] eztcgloot: why u not playing meta boomy comp right here?
[0:38:03] G4L4XY9: true
[0:38:06] Parfisal: i really dont think this is a wow issue per say, but more an issue of the min maxing meta in videogames now that all the info of whats good and bad is so easily accessible. even if people have fun with a spec, they still feel bad if they‚Äôre objectively worse damage, so the tuning has to be soo much more refined than before, which is that much more difficult for devs
[0:38:16] Standy94: How many healers can play dps like that? You can‚Äôt expect random healers to pickup like ret
[0:38:32] ninion1337: "cant have fun here " - blizzard
[0:38:33] G4L4XY9: yeah it restricts creativity
[0:38:38] LesterOfSmeg2: LesterOfSmeg2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hi Caro happy anniversery you look comfy today
[0:38:41] Lenietwitch: @Ok_Kingston mdi is speed running is faaaaaaar away from game state in live
[0:38:44] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[0:38:47] Sebleh: @umarebep if you do it that way you‚Äôre bringing back like 48 team tournaments. there‚Äôs a reasons those were cut down.
[0:39:02] Sebleh: plus weird ass bracket shapes
[0:39:03] Ok_Kingston: they see time trials
[0:39:04] TotallyNotRaien: is it creative comps if its only a couple specs that can off heal to compensate?
[0:39:06] Sebleh: it‚Äôs not feasible
[0:39:38] Lenietwitch: people do crazy stuff in speed running in all games, i dont understand why ppl wanna restrict the format tbh
[0:39:46] Andersonmps: Run bird ruuun!
[0:39:46] thundork: im just surprised how they do trio boss in EB without a healer
[0:39:47] Sebleh: honestly those specs with so much off healing, there needs to be some limit to how much they can heal other players. like half effective heals when cast on others.
[0:39:51] Ok_Kingston: max's idea of points for making a comp 10 points maximum, etc was great
[0:39:52] Sebleh: hey naguura you died naguuraSip
[0:39:52] JMaC727: did tank just die to tyran trash twice
[0:39:52] Morogwen: is there a command or anything that shows which addons and wa's naguura has?
[0:39:59] WassaBoothmane: Ill say this, more blizz interference seems bad bc technically are the riftmages supposed to make rifts from morchie to battlefield, no probs not but damn was that creative and fun to watch

[0:40:26] Morogwen: thanks
[0:40:32] Ok_Kingston: it is crazy that havoc dh isnt in, especially for sanguine
[0:40:34] Sebleh: yeah your 4th dps is just a healer with a shit rotation because they‚Äôre in healer apec
[0:40:35] Sebleh: spec
[0:40:35] there_is_only_war: 4 DPS Meta was born after healing requirement nerfs at the start of the season. Most of the normal healers couldn't heal a normal 20 key and blizzard adapted to this. Maybe healing requirements should go up again, so a healer is required.
[0:40:47] thundork: hand in your quest Okayge
[0:40:51] vratko18: subscriber-area guys where can i find this ?
[0:40:55] OlaF_oo: it's the same topic every MDI/TGP, ppl just don't understand or don't want to and just feel like complaining
[0:40:56] Sebleh: @there_is_only_war 4dps meta has existed since legion.
[0:41:05] Andersonmps: 3 pallys
[0:41:10] eckstrah: Do you think its probably healthier for the game if events like MDI mandate 1/1/3?
[0:41:12] umarebep: @sebleh True, but there are other options too for changing the layout of the tournament. But everything in the end will have good and bad things about it. It will never be perfect
[0:41:15] rein1715: 5 dhs lol
[0:41:18] Kuroz: @vratko18 is twitch connected to discord? you'll see the area about the main channels
[0:41:25] there_is_only_war: but not in every second dungeon :) but don't understand me wrong. I like the 4 dps meta.
[0:41:28] horakk8: Hey
[0:41:31] Acalaysia: if a team is good enough to not bring a healer, I see no issue. Not many people/teams could do those healer-less pulls without dying terrible deaths.
[0:41:31] Kahlandra: i just remember the 2-3 rogues every single dungeon
[0:41:33] Kuroz: above not about*
[0:41:33] Standy94: 3 Aug evokers on 1 ret pally

[0:41:36] Kahlandra: that wasn't good from a viewer perspective
[0:41:42] G4L4XY9: yeah, do they have the spec restriction in AWC?
[0:41:46] thundork: honestly 5 vdh comp would go so hard
[0:41:55] umarebep: The thing people want next to competition is a level of entertainment
[0:41:55] Andersonmps: 5 pallys youd be interesting on AD
[0:41:57] quzulu: awc you can bring three of the same spec if you want
[0:41:59] Sebleh: she‚Äôs singing SCATTER
[0:42:00] Lenietwitch: @eckstrah 100% no, mdi doenst reflect the game state at all, mdi is speed running, there's been seasons where people play classes that are far from meta in live (dk)
[0:42:02] xeion_7: why do people find the 4 dps setup boring, isn't it more exciting that there's a higher chance of something going wrong
[0:42:20] Saabernitee: did you have a good birthday the other day after stream?
[0:42:27] Sebleh: @xeion_7 MDI is already barely relatable to most players. making a 4dps comp is even less relatable.
[0:42:33] JMaC727: @xeion_7 its because there really isn'ta  risk, which is why they're doing it.  theres' only been like 1 death with 4 dps tems
[0:42:37] bleeppblorpp: everyone going to do portal mage tech now :P
[0:42:41] Shadeymedic: @JMaC727 this

[0:42:50] 0vofrito: !discord
[0:42:50] StreamElements: https://discord.gg/naguura
[0:42:50] Sebleh: so for some it‚Äôs cool, sick plays! for most it‚Äôs just top teams abusing the min maxing stuff in the game.
[0:42:56] quzulu: i dont think having three destro locks is any less boring than seeing sp/mage/destro in every run
[0:42:56] there_is_only_war: @xeion_7 but is the chance higher? The top teams don't cate, like Naguura said, everythingg ist planned
[0:42:58] Andersonmps: If you want to see hows the game is, watch TGP
[0:43:00] eckstrah: @Lenietwitch sure, and as players who (probably) play a bit more competitively like us, you know for sure that civilians who watch MDI are going to try to adapt these comps to live keys
[0:43:05] RosaWoelkchen: Let meeee entertain youuuu
[0:43:07] Standy94: All I learned from MDI was we need to nerf Boomkin
[0:43:08] AlphasaurusRexx: @xeion_7 because people will think itll affect their +11 keys
[0:43:08] Sebleh: naguura shut up for one run please? kthx
[0:43:10] quzulu: i think blizz did it mainly cos it made class balance look bad

[0:44:26] thundork: they just dont move and die Sadge

[0:46:04] WassaBoothmane: @thundork oh we didnt even pull mobs onto it, the tank was thankfully more sound minded. it only costed us the key because him (again) and another dps didnt defensive the aoe burst after letting 2 ads hit the boss
[0:46:07] Kuroz: for m+ *

[0:59:46] PaWseN9: Naguura. You are NOT allowed to do more keys after this
[1:00:18] Sebleh: actually no
