[1:35:27] TwistyBro: :P
[1:36:09] xFlameX: dont ever forget calfs
[1:36:11] TwistyBro: What makes this hard, is the fact u can train quads with squats, lunges, legpress, farmers walk etc etc right
[1:36:31] TwistyBro: So a decent squat rack gets you a long way in terms of things to do
[1:36:35] xFlameX: big biceps and small calfs = clown look

[1:42:46] DodhTV: We almost had no snow in Switzerland, unbelievable
[1:42:51] kisballa: Hello sco! How r you? :D
[1:43:50] TwistyBro: Like here where i live in norway we had like 1.5m of snow and then a storm hit. Suddenly had 2m and then the warm weather came KEKW
[1:44:08] TwistyBro: so not only did all the snow blow away during this storm, but the leftover just melted
[1:44:53] DodhTV: Do mechagnome
[1:44:54] TwistyBro: He wasnt the one
[1:44:56] kisballa: @TwistyBro Cant even imagine the mud after that :o
[1:46:00] DodhTV: Do you still play with Method peeps? Or are you too far "behind" ?
[1:46:00] TwistyBro: no mud yet, just 30cm of slushy snow. And now the weather goes cold > warm > cold > warm so it just stays wet and slushy PepeHands
[1:46:14] FrostBeered: says the best tank in wow

[1:49:10] TwistyBro: Nice ^^
[1:49:31] TwistyBro: Yeah i was pushing 3.1k but had to quit becuase i couldnt really sit for too long at a time
[1:50:04] DodhTV: 3k1 in S1 was quite impressive wasn't it?
[1:50:07] TwistyBro: I mean the ppl i do 20s with, we could easily do higher, but nobody is motivated outside of mythic prog
[1:50:35] TwistyBro: I think S1 cutoff was 3.3k or something
[1:50:39] FrostBeered: @Sco Did you retire your warrior?
