[2:42:12] Fatalmistake187: Yeah my guild owns everfall and we are just using the money coming in to craft. I take a day or two off from playing it because the grind can just be too much.
[2:42:52] OceanManCarter: the changes to the elite mobs were so soul draining
[2:43:02] SmokinCoconut: when do u think will ptr go live?
[2:43:07] xsveninatorx: clearing genesis post-nerf is a beast, but it does feel good
[2:43:16] xsveninatorx: or, post-buff rather
[2:43:23] DuploThief: is it Just me or does it look weird hitting a Giant robot that has lasers with a sword?
[2:43:26] Scorpiris_Junoh: Also you can "retrieve materia" and "extract materia" on items if its got the option. I think you might need the prequest to unlock tho
[2:43:33] thecynicalshuffler: big new world patch just went live last night. 1.1.1. supposed to be fixing a huge number of issues...  hopefully
[2:43:35] Fatalmistake187: It's mostly the GS grinding I take time off of, Wars and Invasions still keep me entertained. I just don't want to run Genesis or Laz not being high watermark
[2:44:14] DuploThief: i do but it still feels weird😂
[2:44:14] xsveninatorx: @Fatalmistake187 bet, i'm still dabbling, trying to get my gear from the TP and ignoring WM
[2:44:29] Toradin: this Ui is terrible
[2:44:50] Fatalmistake187: Tbh I am too pentawLol

[2:46:23] twrippin: so new world made it even harder to lever?
[2:46:24] Fatalmistake187: I got to 100 fishing yesterday, that was a entire grind in of itself
[2:46:31] Ariktor: shouldve been fixed in beta, now its way to late
[2:46:44] Secondbreakfasttt: i'll be honest whenever an mmo makes harder to get things done and nerf drops i quit
[2:47:05] JayBoost: @mellkorrrrr like easy mode?
[2:47:06] Ertra: Endwalker releases soon, right?
[2:47:41] GarfielfArbuncle: PepeHands
[2:47:47] OceanManCarter: @mellkorrrrr agreed. It's such toxic behavior to reward the no-lifers who push to max and then make life harder for the casual players afterwards

[2:57:32] rohdey: Kappa
[2:57:33] SD_Timbox: He wanted to stay with Twitch, Youtube wanted him, he asked twitch to match and they said no. So he went to youtube. Same with Timthetatman
[2:57:40] Electafuzz: Even Tim came out and said that's one of the main reasons he left
[2:57:44] NeoChromer: lol why is he in WOW category?
[2:57:45] Getitonthelow: why
[2:57:49] shale93: I have only heard of him because of twitch but I have no idea who the Ludwig is or what he's doing on twitch
[2:57:53] Rexialiton: @Kratosjr1 he alt tabs between wow and ff
[2:58:02] Fatalmistake187: Disguised Toast basically said if you want to be a streamer it's better to not stream just on twitch because twitch doesn't help you grow when you're small

[2:59:13] Kisswani: to be fair , we're talking about WoW half the time we're playing FFXIV anyway KEKW
[2:59:17] Electafuzz: he came back b/c he "wanted the challenge and competition"
[2:59:29] ThunderWaffuL: heres the issue though, what website helps you grow though?, youtube doesnt even have a directory
[2:59:38] Electafuzz: of twitch

[3:02:53] Scojan: 2 years on YT for a huge lump sum that could be invested to support you the rest of your life
[3:02:55] SD_Timbox: Everyone started leaving once DrDisrespect got banned and went to youtube. Everyone was like "oh its possible to succeed outside of twitch." Opened the flood gates to moving around.
[3:03:21] Torse9: It's just based on what he said himself, that he feels set for life. To him it's about his community rather than money. But those are his words.

[5:33:59] kh0nan: xD
[5:34:13] Alexkayzz: Did dcarter get CE in 9.1?
[5:34:13] smashwow: i mean we can do xfaction but there's a bigger problem that needs solved. xfaction is just a bandaid
[5:34:38] smashwow: raid design took a massive hit
[5:34:48] sadlier9: I've officially given up on New World now and not sure if to go back to WoW or try FF - any suggestions?
[5:34:48] nikodemuscrowley: @Towelliee what do you think of clickbait and wumpa fruit gfuel flavors?

[5:34:56] smashwow: when they think syl was an epic fight. they're out of touch.
[5:35:24] shobolt1980: after 9.2 we will go azeroth again?
[5:35:37] Korupcija_: I think sylvanas is an epic fight
[5:35:44] Korupcija_: it's just ruined with stop dps etc.
[5:35:48] RageerPLZ: we have about 5 of our original 20, from Denathruis quite a change.
[5:35:51] RageerPLZ: members
[5:36:22] smashwow: too much down time for no reason. the CD holding for several bosses was awful. KT was a joke of a fight. Painsmith was ok but based on difficulty should have been later in the raid, etc etc
[5:36:29] Coltrias: Hey @Towelliee , can i join you in getting raw emotion? I'm currently doing this step.
[5:36:43] jmalmin: There is 10 man raiding today.
[5:36:48] raakis: I was thinking about a system where you bring 1 of each class
[5:37:01] thorined: half of the classes coudnt get into the raid cause they are just not the best
[5:37:01] abracka_: yes pls 10 man
[5:37:25] MysticalOS: Sylvanas makes a deal with a bronze dragon to go back in past and change history. and then we travel to an alternate universe where we run into kadghar again and he's chasing down that universes guldan
[5:37:27] shobolt1980: 40 man mythic is the best
[5:37:31] Mecabeast: 20 man already excludes alot of classes and tuning is an issue
[5:37:47] Korupcija_: 20 man is good for guilds, but not for pugging on demand
[5:38:00] Naturalbeef: This is only for PUGS. They need cross faction GUILDS

[5:38:57] ChuckyTrees: 10 man is great becuz of loyality , iv had more 20-25man guilds blow up then ANY OTHER TIME
[5:38:57] Rudric_Ice: LUL
[5:38:59] Nevindaz: classic adnies

[5:39:25] scud3333: I think it’s the 100 man raid is what we’re missing
[5:39:28] smashwow: nah 20 man is fine. just don't put 3 hours of trash between each boss and make the boss difficulty ramp correctly. make the encounters meaningful
[5:39:36] N3llee: the size of the raids werent the issue with wiild star
[5:39:48] BoiAtomico: should make 10 man mythic raid available tho, that would be a blast
[5:39:55] Dankmanarmy: Dwarf racial is so op for some things
[5:39:55] MysticalOS: what smash said. it'd be nice to haave a staircase and not just "here are a bunch of easy bosses, and here is a brick wall"
[5:40:25] Rudric_Ice: I just logged into my alliance the other day I saw no one on oribos lmao
[5:40:27] loonydan: LUL yyour title Game says World Of Warcraft @Towelliee

[5:40:33] N3llee: it was their incompetent dev team that squandered thousands of pages of feedback good solid feedback to cause they thought they knew better
[5:40:40] MedicineMan: I didn't know Patch 9.2 added new anime graphics to WoW. Kappa
[5:40:47] Naturalbeef: Are they going to have cross faction GUILDS? Without that, cross faction raiding is pointless

[5:41:58] Cue_Killar: wait your not playing Swotor too? nadiaPog
[5:42:49] Kisswani: D:

[5:43:04] N3llee: kinda makes sense
[5:43:06] Korupcija_: should've been gone long time ago, nobody likes them
[5:43:08] Rudric_Ice: ppl will get mad
[5:43:13] Mecabeast: no not my orc racial kekw
[5:43:16] BoiAtomico: racials are part of WoW's identity tho
[5:43:21] Birder_L: not my rocket jump!
[5:43:23] iblighters: ummm I like my warstomp
[5:43:28] Cru3: The fuck u just say

[5:43:51] mwchaos: is ptr today confirmed or just speculation
[5:43:55] AjjtheDK: All or just the activate ones? @towelliee
[5:43:56] FireEmblemLord: im ok with racials being remove
[5:44:00] jmalmin: Oh the rage that would come if racials was removed. Ruining every race in the game. Could just dump all the races in the trash and toss them away and keep only one race.
[5:44:05] FireEmblemLord: in current

[5:44:10] Cru3: I agree. Screw it
[5:44:10] Jysy: new saga Kappa
[5:44:11] Dinosew: @towelliee would you like to see cross-faction and racials to go? I wonder what it would be like
[5:44:16] theDirtyon3: racials dont really do shit anyways
[5:44:20] Cafe0le: world revamp pls
[5:44:26] abracka_: bank shared between all characters like GW2 pls
[5:44:30] ChuckyTrees: i mean BE racial is a great dispell
[5:44:38] Akrioso: just make it so every race picks a zodiac sign or some shit, any race can just pick there racial ability that way
[5:44:41] thorined: @Towelliee do you mean all of the racial or until the active one
[5:44:42] Kisswani: I kinda like having different passives for different races , maybe even proffession stuff only
[5:44:44] mavericks312: there would be no more humans if no racials
[5:44:49] HotHotHeals: i feel the opposite. I wish racials were more impactful in pve content, so players have to make choice.
[5:44:59] Mecabeast: Tauren rogue pog
[5:45:08] HotHotHeals: u know
[5:45:10] XhadowAlpaca: Is the 9.2 ptr up? And what’s In it
[5:45:12] HotHotHeals: u just holding out man
[5:45:25] abracka_: keep it purely cosmetic stuff, like how mechagnome's body can be used to mine/etc
[5:45:32] Birder_L: they can take my gobbo rocket jump if i can have gobbo monks
[5:45:44] thecynicalshuffler: maybe staysafe would stop playing a gnome...     nah, thats a little too crazy :)
[5:46:08] my_feethurt: what is the estimated spawn time on Ooondastaaaa?
[5:46:20] Wcvechten: put old racials on trinkets or smth, idk
[5:46:43] Rudric_Ice: make it that anybody can choose any racial they want but change the visuals of the spell
[5:46:44] Kisswani: @Wcvechten that's a good compromise
[5:46:50] theDirtyon3: yeah MoP had the good rare respawn timers
[5:47:08] mavericks312: only racial i oay attention to these days is the humans rep one
[5:47:09] HotHotHeals: no way
[5:47:13] HotHotHeals: that would be so dope tho
[5:47:15] abracka_: why not
[5:47:24] theDirtyon3: Pvpers gonna be so mad KEKW
[5:47:25] shobolt1980: 100% mount drop now
[5:47:29] my_feethurt: what addon counts your kill attempts for these mounts?
[5:47:34] P4weZ: but what about all races have access all classes i dont want be like that personally laeKipu
[5:47:41] Mecabeast: dueling outside org or ironforge be dangerous
[5:47:46] Rudric_Ice: it should be alliance is dead on all aspects
[5:47:47] Dinosew: They might as well make every race be able to be every class. Forget which race it is, but they can be everything but a pally I think
[5:47:52] HotHotHeals: would it be possible for blizz to make two new factions that all races could choose from
[5:47:53] xwoulfx: Horde and alliance are fighting horde and alliance in warsong just for fun don’t you know
[5:48:03] Wcvechten: Or a new item slot so you can pick the racial you want whenever
[5:48:09] Kisswani: I'm in favor of removing faction restrictions between people on your bnet friends list .
[5:48:14] Rudric_Ice: I mean you have mercenary mode already
[5:49:44] Rudric_Ice: more systems oof
[5:49:44] Teldrin89: systems.... :/

[5:51:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: "We think there needs to be some friction." ugh lol
[5:51:20] Rudric_Ice: let's hope so LUL

[5:52:13] Secondbreakfasttt: meaningfull
[5:52:25] Molvonos: isometric choices
[5:52:28] Wcvechten: I bet it would've been less of a problem if it was purely cosmetic
[5:52:34] fdssoqueroverumstream: um.kk
[5:52:48] Kisswani: I honestly was in favor of the meaningful choice , because of the story . They should have removed restrictions in 9.1 tho

[5:54:28] Jomuse92: Tow's playing a new game called Final World of Fantasy: Bringers of Shadowlands
[5:54:29] Ryukotsu: The new pre-patch looks alot like final fantasy Kappa :P
[5:54:30] Kisswani: yeah that makes sense too
[5:54:55] Teldrin89: the thing is that even if they would listen now they ignored ppl for so long that ppl will just no give a damn now
[5:55:05] snipsfan: even the conduit energy or whatever took way to long to change IMO. like damn
[5:55:20] Kisswani: true

[5:56:57] Ponickz: i like torghast i run it for funsy's

[5:58:07] Kisswani: they should watch Day9's video about feedback Kappa
[5:58:10] AJVALDEZ: True
[5:58:15] Rudric_Ice: I don't like timers too thats why I hate m+ only PVP and raiding for me
[5:58:16] theDirtyon3: EXACTLY
[5:58:21] Ponickz: @contentstarvedgamer woah woah woah
[5:58:22] theDirtyon3: im mount farming again
[5:58:23] xwoulfx: I want blizzard to listen us as players but we’ve also made a lot of bad decisions
[5:58:32] MisterBongwater: heck yeah, I'm in a full collection mode
[5:58:34] Ryukotsu: They need to play their own game on systems before they release them imo too see if its actually fun
[5:58:38] Rexialiton: @contentstarvedgamer that must be a troll
[5:58:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I know people like to get cracked out and run through Torghast as fast as they can, but that's not my thing
[5:59:12] Sonatta: i don't need to be a dev to see linking power to a story choice is a bad idea
[5:59:20] bebe7044: so this ptr today, is it 100% happening ?
[5:59:20] Teldrin89: but we don't give them ideas - just react to theirs
[5:59:38] Sovekz: And then we have the tier sets which will force many classes/specs in one covenant
[5:59:43] Bogzeh: most other devs make good games without ptr or community telling them what to do
[5:59:43] Alexkayzz: Guess they were like: hey people like being locked to 1 class so let's do it again with covennats
[5:59:43] gorilahazed: is this 9.2 ptr?
[6:00:05] gorilahazed: re-stylized the whole game dang
[6:00:08] Ponickz: LA Gnomes
[6:00:09] Malkyr: So do you like that in FF every single Paladin is exactly the same or do you think having different Specs, Talents, and other choices to make players different is better?
[6:00:21] mihailo1306: so 9.2 is coming in ~february
[6:00:22] Ryukotsu: Right there was more story inside the convs that they could of just "Given" access to at the start
[6:00:27] EclipserEU: i bed they don't know too lol
[6:00:29] ralecgos: wow world of warcraft looks so weird these days!
[6:00:33] MysticalOS: i applied for it for luls
[6:00:37] Kisswani: the idea is to streamline feedback and recieve it from people with different interest in the game
[6:00:40] PvtHudson093: the same goal as the last council they had
[6:00:44] Short_Film: feel like you should be on council
[6:00:45] MysticalOS: they'll probably deny me and i'll give direct feedback anyways
[6:00:47] gwar234: its a distraction to think you are giving them ideas
[6:00:49] Strayyed212: being stuck in a covenant wouldn't be bad if they balanced the abilities out.
[6:00:52] mwchaos: yeah twitch council was somethin
[6:00:57] Ponickz: it went to a persons head
[6:00:58] Treeh0rn: I just want some meaningful loot.
[6:00:59] Rexialiton: @hindenbergg same
[6:01:00] Sonatta: twitch council LUL

[6:01:32] Vondem: I think the council things is meant to streamline the communication between the player base and the devs. Kinda like an unpaid internship for a pseudo-developer role KEKW
[6:01:45] Kisswani: @MysticalOS do they actually inform you if they're gonna break an addon feature in advance or you find out when it hits like the rest of us ?
[6:01:47] Sonatta: SWTOR had class representatives after launch... they were never listened to
[6:01:56] MysticalOS: at this point most of content creators should be in game credits under QA. we report so much shit
[6:02:22] jmalmin: Someone is channeling Spock today!
[6:02:37] mihailo1306: how long will 9.2 ptr last for? about 10 weeks?

[6:07:37] isekmanek: Towelliee  hey this is some new wow look?
[6:07:44] jmalmin: they never tested bosses back in the day.  Not testing 3 bosses would make things more interesting.
[6:07:53] abracka_: it would be more interesting for sure
[6:08:06] VaporySky: VaporySky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! towHAMUP
[6:08:08] MysticalOS: if they got rid of dungeon journal boss mods will go away. we aren't doing that shit blind anymore. not when they have 5 phases and 20+ abilities on these fights now
[6:08:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the journal doesn't have to be added until launch, really
[6:08:09] Mecabeast: what if you unlock the journal after you kill the boss
[6:08:37] Sonatta: the one time the FF14 QA team failed us was back in Stormblood... no one could predict having instanced content early in the MSQ would create a bottleneck that people had to stand in line to take turns clicking on the npc to enter the instance
[6:08:38] Moobot: The Early Access for Endwalker is set to begin on Friday, December 3 at 1:00 a.m. (PST) / 4:00 a.m. (EST)!
[6:08:40] Dankmanarmy: Bosses in vanilla had way less mechanics
[6:08:41] Zakali: Do we know for sure to have PTR?
[6:08:43] Zakali: o.O
[6:08:50] abracka_: honestly, it would help esp in progression type content with normal/heroic raiding. nobody would know what's going on, less room for raid toxicity
[6:08:51] snipsfan: if u unlock the journal after boss kill it.will just be on social media probs in minutes for everyone
[6:08:55] Rudric_Ice: I like they didn't reveal the last 3 bosses honestly data mining kinda kills the hype
[6:09:41] Kisswani: also , if anything datamining part of the Jailer fight hyped me up even more
[6:09:56] mavericks312: that jailer fight is gonna be nuts and im here for it
[6:10:06] Rudric_Ice: oh we do ? nvm then lol
[6:10:37] snipsfan: it's hard cause we tell ourselves we don't want to know...but really we want to know.. lol
[6:10:39] Rexialiton: WOONS
[6:10:43] Kisswani: as long as they dont go with a bland ass maiden model I'm ok with it
[6:10:45] Wcvechten: Magni will become her avatar, yelling CHAMPJAN everytime during the fight
[6:10:51] MysticalOS: i just hope every time azeroth is hit, magni comes out and is like "oh no. we need ot heal the woons"
[6:10:53] jeemjaam: listing in wow and playing other games nice
[6:10:58] jmalmin: we get to see the other side of Azaroth :D
[6:11:04] Sonatta: Azeroth well be a bowl of fruit Kappa
[6:11:05] jeemjaam: milk it !!!
[6:11:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: lol yeah some people are going to lose their minds about something
[6:11:15] Dankmanarmy: Personally aslong as the bosses are fine when my guild get to them i dont mind testing/no testing. And we get CE late, bugs in WF race would be quite funny xD

[7:31:43] stratiss: FF delayed into it
[7:31:44] Dankmanarmy: FF delayed their game
[7:31:44] FranciscoTheMage: the fact blizzard isn't promoting the hell out of means that place has lost its edge
[7:31:48] PvtHudson093: They should push it back to doing it over christmas
[7:31:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: legion timewalking aint no body got time for that
[7:31:54] FranciscoTheMage: they dont care about players or communicating
[7:32:33] FranciscoTheMage: sometimes i think they take the player base and subs for granted

[7:36:40] athedusgrimwilde: I love ES lore so much, but that MMO doesn't really do it for me. I wish it had RP servers lol.

[7:41:00] badbobarino: whats your thoughts on wows longevity? just expansions, wow2, f2p
[7:41:15] Runetailx: If Lost Ark announced a Jan launch, I'd be worried
[7:41:17] Gram64: @serntek well and they have a formula they mostly stick to every expansion so far that works, so no fear of any new system that might be hated, but also means no new system to take risk at something potentially new and fun

[7:43:23] Jango_: there is plenty of hype, you must be high
[7:43:36] Zeoxys: im saying twitch hyped
[7:44:08] r0b928: When’s the WoW mobile game announcement??
[7:44:19] Gingerprimer: Twitch is ngl a horrible metric if you want to know if a game is hype now
[7:44:35] Zeoxys: i feel like every game that has a hype launch gets more than 17k viewers of launch week
[7:44:48] bypized: @Zeoxys twitch hype = new world, fortnite events and warzone LUL

[7:44:56] gingerbasterd: FF Doesnt need hype, best MMO with the best community doesnt need other platforms to hype it up
[7:45:03] CrunkyBrewster: oh god
[7:45:07] idenkaz_: someone is mad
[7:45:13] bypized: Imagine relying on Twitch viewers
[7:45:13] Anbean: its gonna be 100k for sure
[7:45:16] Jango_: there is a large barrier of entry into FFXIV, it will still get views but you probably wont see non mmo players jumping in
[7:45:22] Zeoxys: im saying if the biggest MMO in the world is launching in 2 days ud think there would be more than 17k viewers
[7:45:25] A_Cold_0ne: lol asmon I imagine will have over 100k, whether you like him or not
[7:45:26] Zeoxys: i think that explains it well
[7:45:29] CrunkyBrewster: hell i'll go further.. 300k
[7:45:37] SilkeySmooth: asmongold is even playing it at launch try 140k
[7:45:38] Khoulwhip: it's got more than 17k viewers now, i do believe
[7:45:48] miriones: now thats a true game playing 2 mmos at the same time!
[7:45:53] CrunkyBrewster: yeah exactly @SilkeySmooth
[7:45:58] bypized: What is this guy saying
[7:46:05] Jango_: he doesnt even know
[7:46:06] Bogzeh: on launch day ppl will play it not watch twitch for spoilers
[7:46:06] Atrox93: That's not World Of Warcraft LUL
[7:46:15] Khoulwhip: that's my point.  it's NOT launch and it has plenty viewers
[7:46:20] bimyouX: This isn't wow, i've been decieved

[7:46:48] CrunkyBrewster: well then again, with the server queues for FF14, you may see some of those numbers
[7:46:50] bypized: FFXIV is not as attractive to the casual western gamer like New World is
[7:47:06] CrunkyBrewster: mhmm
[7:47:35] miriones: i wish ffxiv didnt have such boring and out of dated combat
[7:47:36] CrunkyBrewster: i mean look im not the biggest Anime guy here, but even I ended up loving FF14 and I swore it off for years
[7:47:45] Korupcija_: wow's peak on shadowlands launch was 950k on twitch
[7:47:49] CrunkyBrewster: OH right yeah good point tow
[7:47:58] CrunkyBrewster: im treating it like WoW
[7:47:59] Zeoxys: just saying its odd
[7:48:06] Boredslide: LOL @ boring and outdated content
[7:48:07] Jopezo: YEP not gonna be watching at all
[7:48:09] Boredslide: combat*
[7:48:10] Bogzeh: i think most twitch streams will have LESS views than usual

[7:50:06] Fatpally: Thats like me eatting food saying food sucks lmao
[7:50:14] FranciscoTheMage: what's twitch..

[7:53:26] bypized: People also dont consider anymore that some people play games and dont watch Twitch LUL
[7:53:37] mitcheell: etupXD
[7:53:38] Khoulwhip: Right.  Just maxxed out my crafter and gatherer scripts.  I'm ready for early access.
[7:53:44] FranciscoTheMage: @SaraivaBrr you right
[7:54:23] maxypad321: twitch is 100% more mainstream now than ever
[7:54:25] VerdeSol3: old lady knew about it?!
[7:54:28] bypized: Well, that is true, but it doesnt mean that everyone that play a game watch the exact same game. I play FF and WoW but watch TimTheTatman a lot, I dont even like Warzone

[7:55:21] SocioPET: Seems like I havent played FF14 since 2017. Is it wise to reroll or try figuring it all out?
[7:55:22] maxypad321: the better question is how twitch is still the only game in town
[7:55:23] siickz0hniin3: !playing

[7:57:03] im_n0t_jezus: soon maybe, depends on amazon no?
[7:57:15] emznev: prime fortnite watching ninja was so fun to watch
[7:57:21] Jomuse92: I'm glad esports is picking up.
[7:57:26] bypized: But I also feel like nowadays people watch streams more for the person that streams over the game. Like I watch you and watch even when youre playing Genshin Impact
[7:57:32] Boredslide: G4 is coming back baby!
[7:57:38] happybooger: Twitch after Dark featuring the hot tub girls
[7:57:49] Tomolitic: dose anyone even watch that?
[7:57:58] FranciscoTheMage: Amazons streaming is more like a QVC thing tho
[7:58:07] Jomuse92: @happybooger i almost choked on my chip
[7:58:18] happybooger: @Jomuse92 lol
[7:58:18] RedxZone13: Wait this isnt WoW >.<
[7:58:22] xXSiebzehnXx: Oondasta in what 4 mins?
[7:58:22] FranciscoTheMage: selling hawking products .. which if you think about it is not far from what twitch does but it kinda different
[7:58:51] omegalulwarlord: ninja paved the way to a certain extent with that deal stuff
[7:59:01] FranciscoTheMage: SO .. WAS MIXER is retrospect a mistake for NINJA @Towelliee
[7:59:02] Wreckagetv: Ninja and pokimane were in Free Guy movie
[7:59:04] Short_Film: He was on Ellen, ESPN magazine, Jimmy Fallon
[7:59:07] happybooger: wasnt he on the Masked Singer?
[7:59:16] r0b928: I wonder how much his mixer contract was
[7:59:20] Secondbreakfasttt: He's a freaking star lol
[7:59:21] emznev: ptr soon ?
[7:59:21] xXSiebzehnXx: @franciscothemage hell no, he made that money they all got payed out
[7:59:23] Jomuse92: yeah Mr. Blevins is poppin
[7:59:27] Buttscratchrr: Fornite got him that... but his fame was really dropped
[7:59:34] Jopezo: and then he fumbled the bag
[7:59:56] bypized: People say he fell off. Dude, I wish I fell off like that LUL
[8:00:08] emznev: nobody stays on top forever
[8:00:08] r0b928: I remember watching his streams and just watching his numbers climb. It was nuts
[8:00:09] FranciscoTheMage: THAT must be why it was such a BITTER BREAKUP
[8:00:26] sifer007: he made it man
[8:00:28] emznev: truee
[8:00:28] omegalulwarlord: ninja kickin back now just taking it easy
[8:00:31] im_n0t_jezus: if u smart you do
[8:00:37] Buttscratchrr: no hate here GL to him!
[8:00:42] Thagoris: I'm always about 4-5 numbers off on the Powerball for retiring for life.
[8:00:45] emznev: fair play to him love ninja
[8:00:48] griffdog125: lol ninja looks like a coke head
[8:00:57] r0b928: He was in a freaking super bowl commercial
[8:01:02] Secondbreakfasttt: @im_n0t_jesus  you calling him he is not smart lol
[8:01:03] xXSiebzehnXx: King Gothalion always said, someone would have to pay him triple his Twitch pay to move to a new platform, so Mixer was paying hella money
[8:01:08] rik1st: the decision to move to mixer.. was a money grab .. he lost all his viewer just because of that

[8:41:33] Kisswani: damn , WoW stole so much from FFXIV that now they are just copy pasting the whole game Kappa
[8:42:17] KythosMeltdown: gw2 so much missed potential not having trinity / gearing
[8:42:21] KMR07: any badass mmo games for PS5 ?
[8:42:24] Boredslide: that was a wild superbolide lol
[8:42:26] momofantv: ff4 > wow > gw2 is the correct
[8:42:31] momofantv: @KMR07 ff14
[8:42:52] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @Kisswani all WoW is, is a combo of Everquest and Diablo
[8:42:54] Boredslide: i do that to my healers once per dungeon, to make sure they're awake
[8:42:57] wiccawiccawhat: still playing new world at all these days?
[8:43:16] Aldasaris: Boredslide both me and my fairy hate you
[8:43:18] unholyhoit: Not having character power progression is kind of the point in GW2
[8:43:18] Aldasaris: :P
[8:43:35] Raaeni: wouldnt it be the same build as before?
[8:43:39] Boredslide: @CMDR_Abstratus as a healer main, i feel it is my duty to make other healers suffer
[8:43:52] Aldasaris: Boredslide another veteran healer I See
[8:43:55] unholyhoit: no treadmill, just play the game
[8:44:03] Boredslide: @CMDR_Abstratus scholar gang
[8:44:14] Nokterian: I stopped raiding long ago only doing casual if i want to
[8:44:18] Raaeni: yeah thought you implied new datamining
[8:44:21] Kisswani: hopefully we can see the cypher system in action
[8:44:33] Aldasaris: Boredslide I dunno I may put my mortarboard down and pick up the fukken laser beams friday
[8:44:35] Coltrias: He scares me so much when he accidentally use superboilde.
[8:44:46] unholyhoit: cypher is just a zone buff anyway
[8:44:48] Kisswani: ah ok
[8:45:01] Boredslide: @CMDR_Abstratus im 100% moving to Sage LOL im gunna 70-80 it night one

[8:47:28] RealSolaroid: WoW Tweets have started

[8:50:04] Sielu11628: Corgis everywhere!
[8:50:13] Aldasaris: this song is such a banger
[8:50:15] BadXo: I wish WoW didn't have a PTR. This is my first FF XIV expansion launch that I'm taking part in and I'm so exited not knowing anything.
[8:50:18] Nuggetttss: WutFace
[8:50:47] Boredslide: locus SLAPS
[8:50:52] Aldasaris: Alexander was peak FF raiding
[8:50:53] Kisswani: Exponential Entropy is the best imo

[8:51:14] unholyhoit: @feherlofia123 I don't think they're new, it's just that those we're used to seeing aren't working there anymore
[8:51:24] Aldasaris: Gordias was overtuned at first, yes, but they tuned it down
[8:51:24] Boredslide: i dont know man
[8:51:33] Boredslide: Eden raiding rips actually
[8:51:38] feherlofia123: @unholyhoit kekw
[8:51:56] Buckwink: SoD left such a bad taste in my WoW raiding mouth
[8:51:56] feherlofia123: im stoked for the solo que brawl
[8:52:26] unholyhoit: @Poondog I mean Painsmith was fun, everything else though...
[8:52:55] unholyhoit: @Towelliee You can't boost in soloqueue KEKW
[8:53:11] WonderMog: is he running 2 different game dungeons? lol
[8:53:17] unholyhoit: literally the only reason I want a rated solo queue
[8:53:22] feherlofia123: because 3/4th of pvpers playtime in spent running around in oribos. espwcially if u are a dps
[8:53:24] mytherel: I must be missing something.  I dont understand how solo que for a brawl will translate into the arena
[8:53:27] Secondbreakfasttt: @Poondog it made me a m+ andy, and i was a weekly andy
[8:53:38] unholyhoit: It should
[8:53:48] unholyhoit: Otherwise we have skirmishes already
[8:53:59] Aidler: I’d consider doing PVP. but not if I have to team up with someone else
[8:54:11] Infinitepeeep: i think holy pallies would be fine
[8:54:30] stratiss: its 3v3 with rotating dps
[8:54:31] unholyhoit: Even worse case scenario it's better than the 1800 bracket right now @Towelliee
[8:54:49] feherlofia123: Tow, honest opinion, will 10.0 will introduce a new class maybe
[8:54:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: prot paladin healers.....ugh
[8:55:05] unholyhoit: Hopefully a ranged class KEKW
[8:55:07] JiberishUI: Tinker
[8:55:13] Raaeni: please dont waste time on a new class
[8:55:16] JiberishUI: & Dragonsworn
[8:55:19] Necrom93: Necromancer please

[8:55:26] DeanoTV: hopefully ascendancy specs to each class 🙏
[8:55:28] Boredslide: bro its crazy how little WoW adds class wise and such
[8:55:40] Buckwink: nah I want them to revamp the world almost like wow 2.0
[8:55:45] Boredslide: they need to fix the game before they add shit
[8:55:51] DeanoTV: instead of levels add paragon/ascendancy levels
[8:55:53] Noshpan: I would like more race/class combos
[8:55:54] WonderMog: so many classes already, I'd prefer more depth added to game and preferable bring back weapons from legion
[8:55:55] Trademarked: What game is this???
[8:56:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is still room for a mail-wearing tank spec in WoW
[8:56:16] unholyhoit: If they remove the gcd change and fully uncap aoe 10.0 will be fine @Towelliee
[8:56:18] StreamElements: Download Raid: Shadow Legends using my link and enjoy the special in-game loots! Raid is free on PC and Mobile. https://strms.net/raid_towelliee
[8:56:19] Boredslide: Also race/class limitation
[8:56:25] feherlofia123: either healer or ranged dps
[8:56:38] flebbooo: YES POGGERS
[8:56:43] DeanoTV: @Towelliee what u think about instead of levels add paragon/ascendancy levels ?
[8:56:46] WonderMog: I legit thigubt survival hunter was gonna be a tank years ago lol
[8:57:23] CardinalTX: Remember when people thought warlocks were getting tank spec?
[8:57:24] DeanoTV: cant see WoW going past level 70 again
[8:57:33] feherlofia123: what happened to Elyon, it died pretty quick
[8:57:35] Secondbreakfasttt: make raid buffs gone
[8:57:40] unholyhoit: My 10.0 ideal scenario is they add snapshotting back into the game, revert gcd changes and bring us Legion artifacts/legenardies @Towelliee
[8:57:53] WonderMog: @deanotv that's what I liked about legion.  I could do literally anything to help anyone a d I'd still get a little something out of it to up my artifact power of my weapons
[8:57:54] Aidler: remove levels and switch to a entirely skill based system
[8:58:11] JiberishUI: oh shit TOWELIEE LEAK BACK TO 1
[8:58:24] MadstacksEQ: no more Marauder flag?
[8:58:29] Bazsidiver: 60 lvls of leveling d be content
[8:58:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: Getting rid of levels would be innovation, we can't have that lol
[8:58:41] baron_savage: Our characters just wake up back in Westfall. "Whoa man, hit your head?? Anyway, we need to make some westfall stew."
[8:58:43] Boredslide: fuckin runescape shit lol
[8:58:44] Bernardo994: towStop towIt
[8:58:49] feherlofia123: i heard people talk about a classless version of wow , its called wow ascension
[8:58:50] xwoulfx: Going back to lvl 1 and working back up to 60 would be cool IMO
[8:59:09] Aidler: skills you use
[8:59:11] Infinitepeeep: Make WoW like OverWatch Kappa
[8:59:12] Wcvechten: wouldn't mind a dark souls themed game in one of their universes tbh
[8:59:33] Taz_85: Player goes back to being a nobody. Loses all the ''champion'' shit
[8:59:39] Kisswani: that would actually be a new chapter in the WoW saga
[8:59:42] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: @Towelliee I just want the old Vanilla talent trees back
[8:59:45] Voodoochild77: Make WoW like New World. Bugs and all!
[8:59:49] Alegnowar: that would be the coolest thing they could do, imagine the hype for that
[8:59:50] MaliceAlice84: love that idea
[8:59:53] JiberishUI: he knows
[8:59:53] WonderMog: jailer is onevitable
[8:59:57] idenkaz_: we suddenly forget how the skills work we used for 17 years Kappa great story
[9:00:01] JiberishUI: Towelllllliiieieeeeee knows
[9:00:03] baron_savage: Dark Portal opens up. Fel-Humans come through.
[9:00:04] 0dellil0: yes, that would be good, removing the " champion" and the " chosen one " narrative
[9:00:06] Boredslide: Blizzard making a villain win OMEGALUL
[9:00:09] Secondbreakfasttt: "all the achivments and mounts gone" people would lose their sheat LUL
[9:00:11] joe_g_433: @towelliee knows something…….
[9:00:12] MaliceAlice84: I'm down for revamped world too
[9:00:30] Boredslide: 10.0 nah, WoW 2 1.0
[9:00:36] Buckwink: I just hope 60 stays the level cap
[9:00:37] Kisswani: Htoreza Kappa
[9:00:39] abruptdecayO_O: is 9.2 ptr actually today?
[9:00:42] unholyhoit: I think war mode is fine @Towelliee
[9:00:43] feherlofia123: yeah a new cataclysm would be nice
[9:00:51] Wcvechten: wouldn't mind starting from 1 assuming we can just portal back to the ''old'' world where we're back to 60 then, if that makes sense
[9:00:52] Alegnowar: that would be a huge amount of work tho, would they have enough time to do it?
[9:01:03] gwar234: hehe think they will have uni sexes too?
[9:01:10] Taz_85: Could be kinda like Guild Wars 2. All the factions can work together, but in the story, there's still tensions between them, etc

[9:01:34] baron_savage: Azeroth 616
[9:01:36] Uther_The_Lightbringer: they have deadlines
[9:01:39] unholyhoit: KEKW
[9:01:39] Dinosew: For future expansions, are they just going to keep us at 1-60 or will they increase again?
[9:01:40] Aidler: no levels… just points you get from quests etc. and distributed between attributes or ingame skills
[9:01:44] MadstacksEQ: Azeroth Plus
[9:01:45] Nokterian: LUL
[9:01:48] Buttscratchrr: towIt

[9:02:43] Boredslide: bro an NSA ad LOL
[9:02:45] Noshpan: Azeroth Reborn
[9:02:45] BoiAtomico: you wake up in the new reformed reality, it is now the World of Starcraft LUL
[9:02:46] Korupcija_: lit
[9:02:53] SeckSymbols: I think WoW should end the leveling process altogether, just keep adding to the current endgame instead of separating the endgame
[9:02:53] Sm0dey: lol 8 adds
[9:02:53] ConjuredBread: @unholyhoit fair :D
[9:02:54] Phiileh: Permanent war mode LUL
[9:03:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Making Murlocs an allied race is more likely than I want to admit
[9:03:16] Jamesthespud: I think they should send us across the sea to the other side of the World in 10.0 then we have to "start from Scratch" as we have never been there
[9:03:22] Buttscratchrr: we all know regardless... You all will be playing the next xpac!
[9:03:36] joe_g_433: @jamesthespud I was thinking something just like this.
[9:03:37] gwar234: o dam id be all over that
[9:03:40] VIRUSplw: i would play murloc for sure
[9:03:45] ConjuredBread: murloc propaganda in the chat
[9:03:48] Nokterian: Ogre allied race
[9:03:48] gwar234: murloc life
[9:03:51] unholyhoit: Hey at least people stopped asking for Naga
[9:04:07] Jsibs: look how that turned out tho
[9:04:12] Hymirx: after all that has happened can you blame the community for being hyped? i guess no
[9:04:13] Kisswani: imagine hearing mrglllglglglg when you charge into battle , I would quit within 2 minutes
[9:04:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: ogres could work
[9:04:17] Boredslide: yeah WoD went over so well LOL
[9:04:22] ConjuredBread: the only good murloc is a deep fried one on a bun
[9:04:23] BoiAtomico: Also, we shoudn't be ok with the "Jailor rewrites reality" that shit is under explained, makes no sense at all, is lazy and bad writting by them and being ok with shit being served is the same as going to a 5 star restaurant, paying a fuck load of money to eat a hot steaming pile of shit and be satisfied with it
[9:04:25] SeckSymbols: Only good aspect of WoD was raiding
[9:04:33] Aidler: and there was nothing wrong with dreanor kekw
[9:04:35] ZabberzTV: we come back to azeroth and somebody pressed "on" on the forge of originations
[9:04:51] KuariThunderclaw: ...are you playing both WoW and FFXIV at the same time? XD
[9:04:53] Kisswani: what ?
[9:04:55] Taz_85: Damn, that's one long sentence
[9:05:02] Nokterian: WoD anniesYawn
[9:05:02] SeckSymbols: Yes, but its not earned
[9:05:03] Korupcija_: I want a documentary on what went wrong during WoD
[9:05:06] unholyhoit: yes. but why? @Towelliee
[9:05:13] SeckSymbols: You can write something and it be completely unearned
[9:05:22] MadstacksEQ: i kinda agree, alternate reality plots are generally lazy, but at this point what else is there to do
[9:05:26] Kisswani: KEKW
[9:05:26] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[9:05:40] unholyhoit: You can't even fill a paragraph with what we know about the Jailer @Towelliee
[9:05:40] BoiAtomico: I could write a better story, as could 99.99% of the chat in 5 min without effort in chat that would be better than Shadowlands entire plot line KEKW
[9:05:45] WonderMog: If anyone rewrites the world. it should be a time drake in my mind. mess with the past proper
[9:05:53] Nokterian: I just wanna see new lands pretty tired of shadowlands itself
[9:05:56] MadstacksEQ: collected all the infinity stones
[9:06:00] HaxzorJimDuggan: get back with us in 5 minute then i want to see it
[9:06:10] Alegnowar: nobody wants to stop him LUL
[9:06:18] Wcvechten: Also would mean we'd finally lose something big
[9:06:18] SeckSymbols: I think rewriting reality is a copout to retconn bad decisions
[9:06:20] Buttscratchrr: Fk yea
[9:06:29] unholyhoit: When the game being bad is lore KEKW
[9:06:30] skmma897: This is not wow
[9:06:35] WonderMog: get Yoshi P on it
[9:06:37] Korupcija_: but we will stop him so doesn't matter
[9:06:42] Kisswani: we are entering wow's 18th year . you run out of ideas sometimes
[9:06:49] Taz_85: But how would this new reality in the Jailor's image look?
[9:06:52] KuariThunderclaw: @SeckSymbols I mean..  it worked for FFXIV. But then again, they knew what they were doing.
[9:06:53] Plague_GG: This gonna be some endgame stuff where he succeeds and we have to go back in time to get the components to bring everything back.
[9:07:00] MadstacksEQ: "Champion, you must defeat the Jailer! Our world is at stake!" the player: nah.

[9:07:05] WonderMog: get Yoshi P's cousin, Yoshi T to restart WoW
[9:07:05] Nokterian: i do the wait and see approach
[9:07:09] Kisswani: I swear some people would say " bad writing " at everything
[9:07:12] BoiAtomico: They had an established lore, decided to fuck it up and now are trying to make it disappear, fuck that. Just don't be bad at your jobs Bloozard fucks
[9:07:13] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols But it wasn't retconning bad choices, it was retconning rewriting the future, not the current or the past

[9:07:19] Jsibs: Well if they fuck it up theres always Classic servers lol
[9:07:22] LourageTV: yes plz wipe the world, reset everything fresh, back to small scale stories > alot of vanilla's charm is from its simplicity IMO
[9:07:24] ZabberzTV: we lose to the jailer and his new universe is just final fantasy LUL
[9:07:29] Tia214: didnt they do a remake  be it small for cata?
[9:07:29] Taz_85: At the very end, the Jailer breaks the fourth wall and just looks at us, the player, telling us to fuck off
[9:07:33] SeckSymbols: @SeckSymbols Take the second retconning out of that sentence, it was just supposed to say rewritting
[9:07:35] ConjuredBread: Never doin' no harm...
[9:07:38] ThatsProto: I agree. That tune is overplayed
[9:07:38] yulelogged: im excited to see what happens
[9:07:42] Alegnowar: that would be so good expecially since devs prob want 10.0 to be the biggest thing yet
[9:07:45] Buttscratchrr: Same thats the past!  lets get with the new twistie shit
[9:07:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: sweet
[9:08:01] ThatsProto: Cosmic or not, we want good writing. Stop misdiagnosing the cosmic themes as bad
[9:08:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: i could go for some moonshine
[9:08:15] SeckSymbols: @ThatsProto Well..so far they've been bad
[9:08:22] SeckSymbols: @ThatsProto So until they change that, they're bad
[9:08:28] LourageTV: I dont like the cosmic stuff, might aswell be starcraft at this point, good story or not
[9:08:40] BoiAtomico: Love it how Arthas purging Stratholme was a raise undead to stop the legion (SCRATCH THAT)/A Legion plan all along (SCRATCH THAT)/The jailor all along
[9:08:57] Kisswani: Void lords
[9:08:58] Alegnowar: maybe they had to go to cosmic stuff if they wanted a big bang
[9:09:00] Kisswani: yeah
[9:09:01] SeckSymbols: Blizzard hasn't been able to write a cohesive story in ANY game in years at this point
[9:09:08] Kisswani: basically we killed everybody
[9:09:11] Cafe0le: legion story/patches were the best
[9:09:12] Raaeni: blizz has already retconned, hell they even retconned mid expansion in WotLK with anub'arak

[9:09:21] WonderMog: I honestly thought they could of made a whole expansion on emerald nightmare. I was sad they only made it a raid
[9:09:21] hera1621: Rise of the kobolds
[9:09:22] Raaeni: always* not already
[9:09:23] Buttscratchrr: I know peeps are talking about wow like it just came out like yesterday!
[9:09:23] eaglerydr: What confuses me is how can he change reality with only the use of sigils from the death realm
[9:09:25] henchan1: yes give me that shtt a lot of cosmos i tired to do molten core
[9:09:31] Aidler: “bad writing” is overused and nothing else but the story you don’t like
[9:09:33] Boredslide: World of Warcraft 2049
[9:09:42] Taz_85: Always thought the dragons' story  finished in a good way at the end of cataclysm.
[9:09:44] Wcvechten: we'll go back in time to stop bobby kotick from buying activision
[9:09:48] Eobard25: WoW has never had a good story
[9:09:57] jumpered: i think ppl are tired of beeing god slayers, and want to just fuck upp some regular bad guys, scarlet crusade or something regular
[9:09:59] Cafe0le: LUL

[9:10:20] Darklotus_Nakita53TV: Rewrite WoW history and bring back Vanilla talent trees
[9:10:21] Moobot: The Early Access for Endwalker is set to begin on Friday, December 3 at 1:00 a.m. (PST) / 4:00 a.m. (EST)!
[9:10:23] Taz_85: Not that they have to disappear completely
[9:10:26] MadstacksEQ: @Eobard25 i think some of it is decent, but you can tell the ratio of good writers to bad writers is far in favor towards the bad writers
[9:10:26] CrunkyBrewster: I think WoW 2 should be 10k years later, with Cyberpunk Orcs
[9:10:48] LourageTV: IMO vanilla's lack of story is ironically 100x better than any recent expansion story. WOTLK was only good because of warcraft 3
[9:10:56] Raaeni: ah yes please, Warcraft: 40k is the next expansion
[9:10:58] BoiAtomico: @Aidler I don't like Danielle Steele books, don't think it's bad writting. Blizzard is just low effort shit *shrug*
[9:11:12] Kisswani: my dream scenario is going back to the war of the ancients somehow
[9:11:13] CrunkyBrewster: @Raaeni i was waiting for someone to get it heh

[9:11:34] Kisswani: KEKW
[9:11:37] SeckSymbols: I wish the story actually felt connected expansion to expansion, its what FF does so well is that the new expansion doesn't seem so far off from what you were doing before, and if it is like in Shadowbringers case, at least they set up it an expansion and a half prior
[9:11:39] LourageTV: that would be amazing lol
[9:11:44] BoiAtomico: that's because they didn't want to go forward with the story towelliee. Why the fuck didn't we kill Sargeras? He's supposed to be the big bad fucker all along
[9:11:47] Raaeni: my fav part of 40k is that ork ships fly simply because they believe it should
[9:11:56] CrunkyBrewster: right LUL
[9:11:59] WonderMog: I'm cool with cosmic, I just think the characters are lacking depth. I thiught the shadowlands was gonna be like hyperbolic time chamber. 1 day in shadowlands is months in azeroth
[9:12:02] CrunkyBrewster: They make it so
[9:12:11] Boredslide: @Raaeni why all ork things work lol
[9:12:14] Aidler: @theatomicram that’s a common way people like to think. I get it
[9:12:24] SeckSymbols: @WonderMog Thats what they hinted at, us being in the Shadowlands, who knows how time flows outside of it
[9:12:25] joe_g_433: 9.2 PTR today???
[9:12:25] Noksolis: They still haven’t convinced me that Zovaal is a bad guy. He promised me playable Tauren Rogues in his new world. I kinda want him to win.
[9:12:26] Kisswani: @WonderMog that I can accept , maybe the Jailer needed more set up
[9:12:29] Uther_The_Lightbringer: w40k has sick lore
[9:12:31] iblighters: I mean if you play through the legion druid class quest you have to go back to the war of the ancients
[9:12:37] Dinosew: @towelliee she’ll show up and say I’m Mary Poppins!
[9:12:46] SeckSymbols: Jailer is a rip off of Thanos, up to the infinity gauntlet, covenant sigils bullshit KEKW
[9:12:50] VIRUSplw: goku>thanos
[9:12:52] ConjuredBread: Marvel ripped off DC a lot.
[9:12:59] Runetailx: He ain't no Thanos
[9:13:00] Wcvechten: Jailer rewrites reality so FFXIV becomes part of it's universe, creating the most epic crossover event in MMO history
[9:13:02] ventu105: @Towelliee your title in stream say World of Warcraft
[9:13:07] MadstacksEQ: even the halo antagonist gives off thanos vibes
[9:13:18] Jomuse92: Zovaal is thiccer than Thanos slootGasm
[9:13:18] Raaeni: if only FF gameplay was enjoyable for me

[9:13:50] flebbooo: KEKW
[9:13:52] SeckSymbols: That would actually be better than anything the WoW devs would ever think of
[9:13:53] Aidler: in the past 10k years of human history every story has already been told. there are no new stories
[9:13:54] unholyhoit: "...you're awake" KEKW
[9:13:55] CrunkyBrewster: You're finally awake
[9:13:57] BoiAtomico: @Aidler the way they're going, not even the devs know the way the story goes, they have to wait for the writers to come up with shit mid expac, does not sound like a planned story at all. The Sylvannas "Oh he betrayed me" shock. What the fuck did she expect? LUL
[9:13:59] Hymirx: mario jumps out of the green tube KEKW
[9:14:02] Noshpan: Screen goes black. Then you hear "You're finally awake..."
[9:14:05] SeckSymbols: But lets be real, Riot MMO will eat WoW's lunch and take over as the defacto cartoony MMO
[9:14:07] shimwood: World of Starcraft
[9:14:09] LourageTV: they just need to go back to smaller scale stories, its getting ridiculous, no one gives a shit if there is a big plot to "reset the universe"
[9:14:11] DeanoTV: PTR servers going down seemingly @Towelliee
[9:14:16] CardinalTX: Yes dude!
[9:14:18] darkside72: It all rests in the hands of Millhouse Manastorm . WutFace
[9:14:22] Jomuse92: or we end up on the Skyrim cart
[9:14:23] MadstacksEQ: they should hide diablo 4 inside of a wow patch
[9:14:24] Nokterian: I hear the skyrim music when you wake up
[9:14:29] Kisswani: @DeanoTV big if true POGGERS
[9:14:32] EnragedSushi: Oh boy.  Here we go.  Another "Wow killer"
[9:14:34] Warjun11: World of the storm
[9:14:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think that Riot MMO is direct competition....I don't think I would like it, but I like WoW
[9:14:58] DeanoTV: ohhh sheeet
[9:15:01] Alegnowar: do u even think the wow dev team would go for that huge remake of azeroth? seems like an enormous amount of work
[9:15:02] ventu105: I think I fix my PC now I'm downloading FFXIV and try to finish the Shadowbringer story line
[9:15:06] SeckSymbols: @EnragedSushi Oh boy, here we go, people assuming one thing will kill another simply because they believe another game can come in and do things well where one game isnt
[9:15:08] MadstacksEQ: @EnragedSushi "aw shit CJ here we go again"
[9:15:13] unholyhoit: @EnragedSushi you can't kill the dead KEKW

[9:15:35] BoiAtomico: by this time, would be awesome to have a Startship Troopers MMO LUL get your fascist propaganda directly from a videogame KEKW
[9:15:35] xmedpakx: WoW could do the going in blind for raids releasing and make it crazy fun to watch
[9:15:37] stubbedub: Chat do we have an ETA on when the ptr will drop ish?
[9:15:38] EnragedSushi: @SeckSymbols   You said EAT WOW's Lunch.  Calm down bruh and see the sun
[9:15:48] ZabberzTV: the screen goes black and you wake up on a cart trying to cross the border
[9:15:50] SeckSymbols: @EnragedSushi Eat WoW's lunch doesnt mean something is going to kill it, stop being a dumbass
[9:15:56] EnragedSushi: Uh huh

[9:17:14] CCG_337: yeah, i  got all the relics too, and i just did it easily and steady, you grind this shit in pretty unhealthly way

[9:18:07] Alegnowar: she is prob the key to save anduin
[9:18:08] Gram64: First weapon is a lot harder than the ones after, there's several steps that are skipped after you've done 1
[9:18:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: Rehab Sylvanas is going to be cringe

[10:10:29] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee What about WOW Bring a Gunslinger Class like Lost ark
[10:10:35] Wcvechten: Honestly that preview vid definitely didn't do it justice when they announced it
[10:10:38] Kisswani: and the best thing is that we can eventually fly there
[10:10:42] Rexialiton: Whats the youtube channel. couldnt see it
[10:10:44] Wcvechten: the exploration one is so much better

[10:12:45] darkside72: It's just so everyone won't use their water striders.
[10:12:55] Alegnowar: after a year in the maw this looks like heaven can't wait for it
[10:12:57] Kisswani: he was unclear on the conduit catch up part tho .
[10:12:57] xideontv: well they are losing players/money
[10:13:09] SilkeySmooth: thats because there isnt going to be a 9.2.5
[10:13:14] Aidler: I really was hoping that the zone will be big
[10:13:22] Malkyr: Ive been doing that since Legion now, I always leave and wait for catch up mechanics when it gets to the grinding
[10:13:23] Recording_on_the_grass: this will be big like legion
[10:13:34] brewgamingtv: I wonder how long it will be tho. I hope it's not super long.
[10:13:39] Kisswani: the forge of origination right ?

[10:15:44] ParzTV81: its like oribos and nagrand has a love baby

[10:16:28] Rexialiton: I'm fine with that honestly
[10:16:32] foggyghosttwitch: what is the point of this game?
[10:16:34] Kisswani: hopefully they can add some certain secrets to the zone , like Nazjatar and Mechagon
[10:16:34] sifer007: this zone looks meh
[10:16:36] Broomba: dat time gated @towelliee
[10:16:41] Aidler: but they have to end the pre 10.0 era with a bang
[10:16:44] bypized: @foggyghosttwitch you to pay for it monthly
[10:16:49] primetimezhilex: fuc k nazjatar
[10:17:06] Gotxiko: i think its gonna be korthia-type secrets and stuff but in a bigger zone
[10:17:09] Layercake: HahaThink any pearls ?
[10:17:20] Buckwink: nazjatar was awesome some of you guys have such shit opinions lol
[10:17:21] Recording_on_the_grass: what a great life it will be
[10:17:27] ChimmyNeutron: This exploration video alone feels longer than the 9.2 preview video.
[10:17:30] Broomba: music has that night elf starting area feel
[10:17:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I liked Nazjatar, but I head stealth with my druid lol
[10:17:48] foggyghosttwitch: the lore to this makes no sense
[10:17:56] dutchie76: holy tunnels
[10:17:58] Broomba: aw gotcha
[10:18:01] Raaeni: i miss the shell game wqs, they were a nice breather from 'kill x things' or 'fill the bar'

[10:18:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of the stuff is similar to parts of Argus, yeah
[10:18:55] Gotxiko: yeah everyone just accepts it nowadays  KEKW
[10:18:57] bypized: @Towelliee do you like Blizzard exploring the cosmos so much and leaving Azeroth for so long?
[10:19:03] Gotxiko: "im lagging!" oh its the wb"
[10:19:09] deckin4: think we've seen any red herrings in the early datamining thus far?

[10:19:44] Lucidtrix: design is cool
[10:19:50] Gotxiko: this zone would be such a pay-off if they'd tease the first ones for at least two expacs
[10:19:51] Sarcastard: it's the HEAVY METAL SHIP
[10:19:54] Kisswani: desert *
[10:20:12] Plague_GG: Until it becomes the Death Star

[10:20:34] Meakis: imo they need to do flying and other things just so we can see they are not following the same formula as always
[10:20:37] Meakis: let devs be creative
[10:20:40] Meakis: and show it us
[10:21:00] Meakis: flying would be a small thing in it all
[10:21:14] Aidler: and let’s hope it’s not a illusion… what are they hiding..
