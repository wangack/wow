[2:59:52] instructOS: early wrath
[2:59:56] EvenstarTV: no they won't add it
[2:59:56] PowerspeedDK: wow said 3.3
[3:00:05] Xvegeta25: yes it was wotlk but there not putting it in classic
[3:00:07] PowerspeedDK: on their twitter
[3:00:12] billyb37: I would wait to Wrath to level a ret pally up
[3:00:13] zero_chronos_x: If Wrath is tuned to close to endgame, we could very well see dungeon ques from the get go.
[3:00:29] Alkari0n: i thought you would be bladestorming like in the old days :P
[3:00:31] Khalito94: read today that they'll implement a modified version, like a bulletin board where you can request to join groups
[3:00:42] solsaver12: I signed up for beta..hopefully i'll get it soon
[3:00:56] EvenstarTV: They will also add soon +50% xp gain before wrath release
[3:00:57] RuskyHusky3: LFG started in TBC, became popular in wrath. Cataclysm added Looking for Raid (in the last patch, 4.3). People love LFG, hate LFR, in general. I tend to agree with that too
[3:01:31] bloodykingkarns: bloodykingkarns subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:01:31] StreamElements: bloodykingkarns just subscribed PogChamp
[3:02:08] sheerheartattackyk: @RuskyHusky3 problem is that hardcore boomer cried about the lfg tool and they removed it
[3:02:17] PowerspeedDK: Yeah I remember trying to kill Deathwing on hes back in LFR and never got him XD
[3:02:18] solsaver12: LFG kinda looks like retail version
[3:02:33] Toiletsmurf: lfg wasn't available until wrath. there was no lfg in TBC
[3:02:35] EvenstarTV: Are you guys talking of group finder? the one that teleports you to the dungeon?
[3:02:36] sheerheartattackyk: i really dont like sitting around shattrath asking for group for 1h
[3:02:46] RuskyHusky3: hey chat or Swifty, do you know if they have announced the names of fresh servers yet?
[3:02:52] PowerspeedDK: Yeah
[3:03:11] Khalito94: TLDR: random dungeon queue no, group finder yes
[3:03:23] Toiletsmurf: They won't announce the new servers until after beta
[3:03:43] PowerspeedDK: you just made that server not a low pup server XD
[3:03:48] Sococed: and what about BGs ?

[3:04:08] RuskyHusky3: @sheerheartattackyk  yeah i really think they should listen to the majority of community and add LFG. So much better that way
[3:04:14] PowerspeedDK: bgs is the same
[3:04:25] sheerheartattackyk: i would go the same server as you swifty so i can heal you, but problem is i dont pvp since 6 years and never got past 1800 LUL
