[4:47:02] knoxviillee: ehy are you levling this char btw?
[4:47:06] ironforge_1337: grinding in itself is fine.  but if it winds up feeling like a job and becomes tiresome, then it's no good
[4:47:08] knoxviillee: why*
[4:47:41] chimerablaque: @Swifty is this classic or tbc?
[4:47:45] Takedown_Notice: it is a job
[4:47:54] RoXx1811: @Gizimoo86 the 40% xp is huge tho. i could actually skip zones and there are no real "no quest - gotta grind solo or in dungeons" phases

[6:08:51] RoXx1811: did they really make a statement about adjusting the ranks?
[6:08:54] LauraKittyCat82: swifty why don't you use your blizzard connections so they actually give us our honour - they hvae the database of standings
[6:08:59] eshonxyz: i did 100k honor in av this week
[6:09:21] rbubbaray: isnt the adjustment next week , but they said we dont get anyting for the past
[6:09:21] The_Crafty_DM: so the catch up starts next tuesday?
[6:09:30] Astrosparkle: The reality is most people going for a quick R14 are going to be 60 this week grinding max level.
[6:09:31] RoXx1811: even if PVErs catchup rankers still have a HUGE edge tho
[6:09:34] D1rtyBurger: ppl don't want pvp'ers to have r14 weapons before they see a viskag drop haha
[6:09:34] rbubbaray: yeah

[6:09:43] Teagens: Did they fix anything?
[6:09:46] Teagens: Or break it?
[6:09:48] rbubbaray: they dont give us anything extra for now
[6:10:11] LauraKittyCat82: @Swifty why don't you use your blizzard connections so they actually give us our correct rank- they hvae the database of standings

[6:11:48] rbubbaray: but we still not 60s yet , so any pts helps
[6:11:59] Teagens: At LEAST do the decency of giving the US 24 hours to work on some honor to make it uo
[6:12:00] ryanblue98: Eu now can invade NA with better gear
[6:12:01] Teagens: up*
[6:12:04] Teagens: Then turn it off again
[6:12:10] HeIlraiser_: well if everybody stopped playing maybe they would get their act together
