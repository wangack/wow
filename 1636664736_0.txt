[1:09:16] atamala: that's a nice QoL
[1:09:20] SLoPPYALieN: pretty much not in combat, or PVP, but otherwise it seems like you can swap
[1:09:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: Changing them while flying is good
[1:09:30] smashwow: @snowmang94 anywhere except a M+ key as long as you're not in combat. and as long as the talent isn't on CD
[1:09:39] MR_WYTE: Are there patch notes for this morning's maintenance? Guess not yet?

[1:34:10] Sollice: @Towelliee Sounds like a Seinfeld moment right there
[1:34:15] SLoPPYALieN: $10k in a whole... for a business at a loss is just tax write offs
[1:34:19] Blessedheals: @Towelliee I totally agree with you on that.  I tried streaming for about 2 months and found out it was more work than it was fun for me.  I'm glad I didn't waste a lot of money on stream decks and such.
[1:34:20] messinna: they send me a Beta  invite ....where i can join what realm is EU populated more ?
[1:34:23] TweektheProphet: I would argue the audio is the most important thing to look at
[1:34:39] SLoPPYALieN: not $1 for $1
[1:34:47] phearsumm: tax write off? You spend 10k to get 3k back?
[1:34:52] cassetto: @Towelliee thanks for the suggestions! I'll try! I am shy because I'm not a native English speaker so I'm self conscious about my accent.

[1:35:56] Moobot: you can figure out how long you've been following any channel by simply clicking on your own name in chat :)
[1:35:57] Sollice: If you want cheap lights that are good....Go to Home Depot and buy those cheap 5 dollar clip on can lights they use for construction work and spend 11$ on their RGB bulbs. Work with Alex, Google and Apple. Now you have good lights that you can color change for like 30 bucks

[1:39:29] skrin001: yours looks so different then mine and we both have 12.95 hmmm
[1:39:38] MILESkg21: is it in Blizzard Interface ??
[1:39:44] flippantix: The setting is in ElvUI config "WOW\_retail_\WTF\Account\<accountName>\SavedVariables\" and it's called ["keyDown"] = false,
[1:39:45] PigPenLen: @Sollice haha
[1:39:53] flippantix: it's probably leftover from previous version
[1:39:56] 91Niki: @Towelliee I even reverted back to previous elvui, and I still have the issue
[1:40:09] Retpally9329: If it was quality controlled they wouldn't drop it in such bad states
[1:40:35] MILESkg21: gotta make them quarter sales
[1:40:44] luckfore: feels like they were 75% done and had to release it
[1:40:46] 91Niki: @Towelliee and I have the "Key Down" option, it is on, but it doesn't effect it. Gotta wait for an update for them to fix it probably
[1:40:46] warrenny: @retpally9329 Yawn
[1:40:47] xRykku: People just need to chill out. It'll get fixed eventually
[1:40:55] Bigbharash: yeah be elvui is causing the issue. if you turn off elvui it works

[1:41:27] looney199725: does anyone know why tf the rdy check button is gone with the new ui?
[1:41:30] ObsidianHealer: I easily could've waited until Dec/Jan if they wanted to have the game in the oven longer.
[1:41:36] 91Niki: @Towelliee send you screenshot in discord dm

[1:41:51] Malkyr: How are you liking Warrior in the new patch?
[1:42:12] Inthezonewow: It seemed like there was a really good plan in place with Alpha Phases, but Beta was not really organised
[1:42:25] 91Niki: Yeah I went back hoping it would fix it
[1:42:27] 91Niki: It doesn't
[1:42:30] SlippieSlik: @towelliee key down option is not available right now since there is a problem between wow and the elvui. They posted on their discord. It's on bliz end not theirs.
[1:42:40] zysmos: i have 12.95 and i don't have it neither
[1:42:44] srze94: they just need to reach the annual profit goals :D
[1:42:49] Ayoojimmy: I think im having the same issue to be honest
[1:42:50] luckfore: it probably didnt work so they removed it while they fix it

[1:43:38] porsche911cv: Krusty the Krab disagrees

[1:48:40] stallowned: a voice line? KEKW
[1:48:40] mrniceguy817: I saw something that said to earn all the ow skins without paying takes hundreds of years in game time to unlock
[1:48:42] 91Niki: @reggiepowa Yeeep we thought so too. But apparently not. Idk if an error or not. But a ton of people on reddit are complaining about it too
[1:48:43] MILESkg21: what a fuckfest game KEKW

[1:49:23] reggiepowa: the game plays better than ow1 imo, 5v5 was a good move
[1:49:29] Kinghorn: there is a pve event going on that seems ok
[1:49:35] LootFeverTV: u mean the PvE ppl have to pay extra for? xd
[1:49:44] PigPenLen: whens the pve coming?

[1:53:05] EclipserEU: i did "quit" years ago. only to restore them later
[1:53:08] MoodyVanessa: you can't truly quit WoW

[1:53:43] instant_savage: wst about eonar
[1:53:54] ZeroNpcTV: so we can just bang our dick in legion raid?
[1:53:58] wEiRdO_dUdE: Skipping that crazy dark stuff on mythic difficulty would be nice
[1:53:59] 3663Sharad: Eonarwill be a block or did they changed the fight?
[1:54:10] king_julian_96: why have a shutdown on a Friday that’s odd since when did blizz do shutdowns on a Friday

[1:55:10] CaptBunghole: lol

[1:55:26] uglla3np: typical fucking parent behavior

[1:55:46] Koudgamer: if you need to go then ask the party to kick you. simple
[1:55:48] DeanoTV: nah we need that for M+, too many people quit

[1:55:52] wEiRdO_dUdE: If it's going to be rated, it has to be handled seriously
[1:55:58] CraftyClaw: Definitely a penalty for m+ leaver
[1:56:10] DeanoTV: need a penalty for M+
[1:56:12] uglla3np: nothing better than entitled parents playing wow while neglecting their children and then find excuses by blaming random stuff in wow
[1:56:15] CaptBunghole: oh man... LFR for M+? that sounds like a nightmare
[1:56:21] darthhelmett: Nah, there should be a penalty.
[1:56:21] 3663Sharad: yeah leavers solution will be afking till the end PvP or M+ doesnt matter

[1:56:32] warrenny: @deanotv Yes only lead suffers
[1:56:35] captiv8: Still needs to be punishment of some kind.
[1:56:37] asmodai4823: they cant put a penalty
[1:56:57] MILESkg21: you just restart the key
[1:57:08] Rulem: maybe a flag on the account?  And after 2-3 they receive a penalty
[1:57:11] instant_savage: the old this key isnt going well so im gonna alt f4 and make it seem like i dced trick,
[1:57:12] Cosmolus: there's no fucking way in hell imma sit on a +15 with people that don't know the dungeon. That is a +1h waste
[1:57:22] darthhelmett: In the higher end keys people usually agree to just disband, but the low end keys are brutal and i feel bad for people who don't have premade groups
[1:57:38] Baaltaza: Yeah, the last patch fixed that for me
[1:57:55] Baaltaza: or hotfix*
[1:58:34] king_julian_96: why not towelliee I literally had people leave in 2 seperate keys I was in earlier today on my hunter alt even though had plenty of time left and clear as day was going to time yet they still left makes no sense hence bring in the mythic plus penalty
[1:58:36] instant_savage: @towelliee  can u see if eonar is soloable
[1:58:41] browniebatter: !drops

[1:58:50] stabzmcgeee: @darthhelmett this 100%,, once i broke into +20s way less leavers and if the key went bad the group would just call it quits as a whole
[1:58:54] CaptBunghole: that sucks
[1:58:58] Polvs: can you try thunderfury with cow?  to see the tmog @Towelliee
[1:59:07] wynot232: is Wrath a separate sub now?
[1:59:12] MILESkg21: D:
[1:59:17] Rulem: flag account; after doing it more than once, give a penalty
[1:59:20] luckfore: LUL
[1:59:27] 3663Sharad: Group survey @Towelliee  Kappa
[1:59:29] Baglio: there shouldn't be a punishment...suck it up and run another key OMEGALUL
[1:59:30] zysmos: what if he doesn't  say anything ? LUL
[1:59:31] warrenny: Chat logs reveiw how dungeon was going
[1:59:32] marzetty23: how ya liking the pre patch towellie
[1:59:34] ZeroNpcTV: i would say if you plan to leave, dont queue for group
[1:59:34] LearnedSomething: I don't think they want to be your key cops
[1:59:34] AndrewShifuVA: if they continue to play after they exit the dungeon
[1:59:46] soysos91: chat reviews would take a lot of resources I think
[1:59:49] warrenny: End of dungeon player review
[1:59:50] Klarynse: morning @Towelliee and Chat!
[1:59:56] ForgottenTime: @rulem No cause when I’m running with my friends and we aren’t gonna time the key we just leave
[1:59:58] Barret: sounds lazy
[2:00:06] Baglio: be careful with your groups...if you get in a crap group, go get a new one...it isnt that deep LUL
[2:00:06] CraftyClaw: they don't need to - players should be flagged as a leaver - so when people invite them they should be able to see how many keys they have left in the last month or something
[2:00:07] captiv8: An easier fix would be just don’t drop the key if it happens that way the leader isn’t punished.
[2:00:13] cyb3rduck365: should do a que up to 15, then keys from there
[2:00:16] stabzmcgeee: why should people be forced to stay in a key if its not doable
[2:00:28] ForgottenTime: @rulem We’re a 5 stack and if we fuck up a pull on a 24 we need to restart
[2:00:34] LearnedSomething: if someone leaves a lot of groups, people should notice and let each other know to avoid taking them
[2:00:35] R1ngberg: I think the official m+ score was their way of giving you the most info about a player before inviting them.
[2:00:38] DeanoTV: but they are wrecking the leaders key
[2:00:40] LearnedSomething: it's not blizzard's job
[2:00:46] CraftyClaw: @stabzmcgeee Could do a majority vote to end the key
[2:01:05] lithium364: just exclude people from ragnaros kekw
[2:01:06] zysmos: fortunately wow is a game where you can avoid pugging
[2:01:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe just stop downgrading failed keys so at least the leader can try again
[2:01:11] 3663Sharad: Surrender button like
[2:01:13] Trif0ld: "not doable" maybe not the time you want but rarely are you in a key that cant be completed
[2:01:16] ZeroNpcTV: @ForgottenTime if its not doable ofcourse it is okay to leave but imagine you finish half the boss and there's still lot of time
[2:01:17] CaptBunghole: if it has nacrotic lol
[2:01:18] Trif0ld: but also maybe after x amount of deaths
[2:01:25] Rulem: add a vote disband

[2:01:34] warrenny: @stabzmcgeee Not doable? Not 3 chestable? not timeable?
[2:01:34] Admiller0: they could do a 15 minute interal queue cd similar to bgs or lfr and if you leave in that time you get a deserter debuff - otherwise leave it up to the players

[2:01:53] Shrenko: overlay towelliee
[2:01:55] EmpathyLiveChat: I think there are many situations in which it would be understandable to leave in the middle of a dungeon
[2:01:58] OhNoNotAgain: @Trif0ld that would be abuseable, person wanting to leave could just yeet themselves or force wipes
[2:02:02] CyberSyphon: Optional downgrade of the key would be nice. When you fail the key, you have the option to lower it or to keep it at its current level.
[2:02:05] R1ngberg: Right now there is a punishment. It's just on the key holder right now.
[2:02:10] RaginCajun05: my question is will Mythic Eonar be able to be solo'd come Dragonflight?
[2:02:10] warrenny: Vote disband is best
[2:02:12] CraftyClaw: It would just be the first person to leave that would be punished
[2:02:15] MILESkg21: if you leave after the first boss you wont
[2:02:25] EmpathyLiveChat: sounds good
[2:02:29] Baglio: @ForgottenTime I mean that shit just happens man. Get another key and move along at that point. Idk why people get so bent about keys tbh, it isn't like LFG isn't FILLED with more
[2:02:35] michaelmm: IN dungeon finder only the 1st 2 to leave gets deserter
[2:02:35] Bard_Telvanni: Are the realms back up already?
[2:02:39] Holysal: then you get the lost ark were ppl just afk if they cant leave with vote disband
[2:02:39] Deadelus0: Vote disband would be awesome
[2:02:43] instant_savage: @ragincajun05 i have thensame question
[2:02:48] JediNeo99999: what if a bad group won't vote to even if it's not going to happen

[2:03:17] JediNeo99999: i've seen groups that can't finish 15s try to keep going
[2:03:17] lithium364: just scan for the n word in chat before someone left, sadly would work wonders in RBGs
[2:03:34] Deadelus0: Yup, they could even add restrictions to it. As in, minimum amount of deaths / wipes / offline players etc..
[2:03:38] michaelmm: They could have the derserter not apply if the group is more than 50% over the timer.
[2:03:43] warrenny: @jedineo99999 Bad group to me may be differant to you
[2:03:55] Shrenko: @Towelliee overlay
[2:03:56] TheOldSchoolRyan: Just slash ignore deserters
[2:03:58] JediNeo99999: @warrenny bad group = can not complete the key
[2:04:05] Deadelus0: @michaelmm also a good one!
[2:04:11] king_julian_96: I always never got leavers so what if you don’t time a key still counts towards vault so who cares literally no reason to leave
[2:04:22] rosina_scarlett: servers up that was fast
[2:04:23] warrenny: @jedineo99999 Minuite or two over who cares
[2:04:26] LearnedSomething: I've only ever had people leave depleted keys
[2:04:28] MILESkg21: lmao work in progress
[2:04:32] LearnedSomething: or DC's
[2:04:33] CraftyClaw: many of my friends will not do keys without a full friend group because of having the risk of leavers wasting time
[2:04:33] Shrenko: why is this a work in progress cinematic ?
[2:04:36] stabzmcgeee: just remove the drops 1 level on deplete
[2:04:37] michaelmm: I thought Rio could track leavers - then group leads could decide if they want to take a serial leaver or not.
[2:04:38] LearnedSomething: but I'm picky about who I bring
[2:04:38] JediNeo99999: @warrenny that's completing it, i said can't complete
[2:04:49] Kilas117: whatr frame addons do he uise?
[2:05:02] vaxian_0528: servers up
[2:05:04] Tyrou: doesn't feel legacy tho
[2:05:10] duncon: still amazing how bad ragnoros server is. are they aware that they have such a bad rep?
[2:05:14] Baglio: @warrenny @warrenny on the other hand, people DO care if its gonna be their highest completion for a key - or the only for that key - and its a failed key on their io, hindering them from more groups
[2:05:22] warrenny: @jedineo99999 Ok fairim not trying to be a dick
[2:05:30] 3663Sharad: Imagine the mount drops on Beta KEKW
[2:05:38] MILESkg21: Rag will always have a bad rep
[2:05:41] dammit_odra: idk, one shot should be legacy
[2:05:45] its_bwookie: what is his shield called? thats sick
[2:05:55] ZeroNpcTV: legacy should be 1 shotable
[2:06:06] the_general01: illidan is

[2:06:09] DeanoTV: it doesnt say on prepatch tho @Towelliee just DF launch for legacy

[3:49:47] MR_WYTE: RIP EQ Next. :(
[3:49:55] TheGiant99: @Towelliee good morning my friend

[3:49:57] DisparagingTurtle: Unironic EQ2 player here
[3:49:58] N3llee: I think its funny that many WoW players bitched and cried when Ghostcrawler was the lead director of WoW and cheered when he left. Now everyone is excited about a new mmo he has full creative control.
[3:50:00] MILESkg21: EQ Next was gonna bang BibleThump
[3:50:05] Sollice: Expansion# 54327432  Everquest Unleashederingerest The 43th coming
[3:50:05] lithium364: will there be drops for wildstar private servers tho
[3:50:10] Buckwink: no chance its free to play
[3:50:16] tundrafreeze_gaming: if the riot mmo has housing I'm sold
[3:50:27] abracka_: free to play with optional sub model that gives in game bonuses like crafting/battle exp / monthly credits for in game store
[3:50:37] UltraKSlaya: wowplayers complain if the sky is blue
[3:50:37] Gargantix: A Ruined King was a buy to play Riot game
[3:50:38] TompsonX: Only their singleplayer game is buy to play as far as I know
[3:50:39] abracka_: 100%
[3:50:41] iCarDog: just the turn based Ruined King game
[3:50:41] TheGiant99: why is eveyrbody so needing player housing
[3:50:43] Buckwink: yeah true

[3:50:56] TompsonX: It was purely singleplayer
[3:50:56] Artenuous: it was a rpg i believe
[3:50:59] TompsonX: Story based
[3:51:00] Gargantix: no, but it was a riot game was wasn't F2P lol
[3:51:02] ObsidianHealer: Ruined king was single player

[3:51:06] MILESkg21: spent 5k but didnt know LuL
[3:51:23] NeedsCoffee: if riot taps the console market on this new mmo, they'll be set
[3:51:24] paulson14: stormrage still down!
[3:51:33] Revoca: high chance its free to play with a pay to get ahead cash shop

[3:51:52] luckfore: tencent multi dorrah company
[3:51:57] TheGiant99: @Towelliee how will we find out if we make the New World team
[3:52:03] TompsonX: I would be surprised if it's subscription based,
[3:52:10] MILESkg21: riot doesnt do sub based
[3:52:14] ObsidianHealer: I dont see Riot doing a Sub based MMO
[3:52:23] MR_WYTE: I think everyone would pay whatever subscription they ask for though, tbh
[3:52:23] im_capy: they will have a battle pass
[3:52:26] abracka_: honestly i can't see it being anything other than free to play with optional sub for in game goods/bonuses
[3:52:27] TheGiant99: Ok sweet

[3:53:30] Thoreya: AoC omegalol
[3:53:31] Artenuous: it'll likely have a battle-pass type of thing like they do in league/tft/valo
[3:53:32] Sollice: We can probably remove it I guess
[3:53:39] luckfore: we wont see AoC till 2048 KEKW
[3:53:47] MILESkg21: since lost ark is dead might as well remove it LuL

[4:38:32] tanek1966: Do you think they will add some borrowed power later in the expansion?
[4:38:36] Aidler: outside of m+ dungeons
[4:38:39] cosmothug: @Towelliee is there anything to do in dragonflight besides instanced content that we've been doing?
[4:38:53] altair19992: is that a weird flex sir because  borrowed power has been the most hated thing in wow
[4:38:56] altair19992: monkaS
[4:39:03] Cafe0le: i only want to play arena, need no more content. Just make gearing alts a breeze and im happy
[4:39:03] FluffyDooom: I did island expeditions for fun and to collect all the mounts etc. in BFA and I've also completed all the achievements in torghast now. I kinda like the chill grinds as well :P
[4:39:11] Rickbamfion: yeah went with the basketball ppl kept asking for it
[4:39:13] potnudel: but there borrow power in the talent tree from the legendaries
[4:39:27] Lostdogal: @Affiiance I didn't have a box but faint lines all over them. changed the texture quality in graphics settings fixed it. Maybe that would help.
[4:39:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, most players want the crazy powers, just not hassle
[4:39:33] HaxzorJimDuggan: liked the power, hated acquiring it
[4:39:40] GODZILR1: i wish we could select 1 "borrowed" power to take with you anywhere
[4:39:45] altair19992: exactly; the devs do not have enough time to develop borrowed, never will, so therefore, we hate it
[4:39:47] MILESkg21: we shouldve kept the Artifact weps
[4:40:02] Saltyvape: we didn't like that the cosmetics were tied to the power. If they would have given us the choice without making us lock into a covenant we didn't like it wouldn't have been an issue
[4:40:04] ObsidianHealer: @GODZILR1 it wouldnt be borrowed at that point. nagHmm

[5:33:37] TheCornRatsss: rank 3 material
[5:33:45] ImjustBatin: is it different quality tho

[5:34:19] 91Niki: They want? ijpLURK
[5:34:21] Velanthos: I think for each reagent you provide, you have to have the full amount of that particular mat
[5:34:21] 91Niki: what *
[5:34:29] Onearmyof2: only sometimes, theres some bop items
[5:34:30] Vivelli: kinda lame if u have to have all the mats and it cant be partial

[5:34:43] zeeAbe: @JustSalvation There is quality levels on ALL the materials.... You want bad vials? Those you get from vendor, but good vials come from jewelcrafting ;)
[5:34:47] JustSalvation: the ore it takes is a different quality than what's in your bag
[5:35:23] Karawan: from what i understand, this is created for ppl without professions, u brig the matts for crafters and they craft the item for u

[5:44:13] doogs44: ty
[5:44:14] DogShep: Don't worry I'm leveling up a toon from 60 to fill your order now ;)
[5:44:21] rbgdev: Tyrhold
[5:44:21] danksly: will a pointy stick do
[5:44:24] tiyanigean: The UI needs a checkbox that says "show canceled / finished orders"
[5:44:33] kingkafro: whats the use of personal order? @Towelliee
[5:44:35] DogShep: Me neither tbh
[5:44:41] moa285: So... everything is BoP now plus you have to wait... instead of buying BoE from the auction?
[5:45:06] wEiRdO_dUdE: If the order is basic, you can probably do it
[5:45:06] Youredoneson666: go to your crafting bench
[5:45:07] handlebarswow: you're nota  crafter
[5:45:09] doogs44: other vendor?
[5:45:10] niebvelungen: Crafting Table
[5:45:12] zeeAbe: @kingkafro Personal order can require quality, public can't. Also personal order is directly sent to a specific character, so you could send it to your alt for a BoP item
[5:45:12] PigPenLen: a guy at work pays his son to farm for him during the day on the summers and weekends and now I want to be his son

[5:46:35] zeeAbe: Click the Search button maybe
[5:46:35] Youredoneson666: So you can't see them

[5:49:15] WoWRoach: I'd rather have the filter.  Maybe days I just want to make what I have and not go looking for recipes.
[5:49:16] SLoPPYALieN: Won't Fix - Workaround acceptable. LUL
[5:49:23] notColt45: Sadge another failed profession update

[5:50:14] SarcasticDibbs: Thats why the filter is good

[5:53:27] Thoreya: oh shit
[5:53:31] Jonboto: did you add that crafting difficulty thing? that's probably why
[5:53:37] Metket: @Towelliee you selected extra quality while you are giving the order
[5:53:40] SLoPPYALieN: I didn't see a mailbox icon either

[5:53:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I wasn't paying attention to a mail icon
[5:54:02] LucidFearGaming: There needs to be a notification to let you know it's been completed.
[5:54:04] VoxDeMorte: i feel like im ordering door dash rn
[5:54:04] Finansdepartementet: its small a small letter on the top right above mini map iirc
[5:54:07] Metket: @Towelliee yes
[5:54:07] niebvelungen: Yes
[5:54:27] LearnedSomething: you did
[5:54:36] LearnedSomething: it was next to those binoculars above your minimap
[5:54:45] s7wede: Do another sword and I'll craft it to check
[5:54:48] donin: can you edit an order? like lower than 20k
[5:55:01] niebvelungen: @donin nope
[5:55:06] krozym: you can equip the reagent bag now on beta?
[5:55:07] WoWRoach: Mail icon is not in the same spot.  It's at the top screen just to the right of your buffs
[5:55:25] SLoPPYALieN: Looking for fat stacks, to put my shit in large stacks.
[5:55:39] Finansdepartementet: how does a personal order work? @Towelliee
[5:55:43] Zivs: modcheck
[5:55:50] Todmeister9000: LUL

[5:57:00] Onearmyof2: @Towelliee does it say anything in chat when someone does complete it?
[5:57:01] SLoPPYALieN: it probably refreshes the mailbox icon with a zone change or load screen. :D
[5:57:02] handlebarswow: there should def be a hud notification or something that an order is completed
[5:57:12] Metket: @Towelliee no system messages as well in chat?
[5:57:20] bloodogg35: lol
[5:57:39] happyspot: Are work orders region wide like the ah?
[5:57:48] Feanohr: Feanohr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[5:57:54] themaxpower1: Does a personal order send the work order to a specific person that you select?
[5:58:10] SLoPPYALieN: ask for another sword and @s7wede will make you one.
[5:58:17] niebvelungen: Koranos
[5:58:18] Metket: work orders are not regional
[5:58:20] niebvelungen: It said
[5:58:23] Zivs: well servers on beta is a bit different usually?
[5:58:37] SLoPPYALieN: @Towelliee yeah that work order was made from Khoranos or something like that.

[6:01:36] handlebarswow: there should be SOME notification like when you win an auction
[6:01:37] Lostdogal: Can mechagnomes still act as their own crafting tables?
[6:01:37] Rictamar: remains to be seen how it holds up in endgame based on crafted gear power and how annoying it is to craft. Will be a time vs. reward thing
[6:01:47] SLoPPYALieN: I want a big system message that says "Work Order Completed!"
[6:01:48] sliproach: would be nice tho like when you win a auction or are out bidded
[6:01:48] Rygothx: So what happens if the crafter doesnt craft and send you the mats?
[6:01:53] TomClancysRainbow: Yes, its called rolling a mechagnome Kappa

[6:02:24] lel3owski: lel3owski subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[6:02:25] s7wede: @rygothx That isn't how work orders work. You only have the option to craft it.
[6:02:33] PigPenLen: that would be a badass side panel
[6:02:37] fiercepanther: That's sweet! I can't wait to get my collector's edish
[6:02:41] Sollice: That looks realy good
[6:02:46] venom366: like and retweet @Towelliee Kappa
[6:02:48] r0b928: Does it come with a cd?
[6:02:59] ultimatebutt: only for 30 min
[6:03:02] s7wede: Yes for 24h till it resets
[6:03:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Good question
[6:03:05] Velanthos: 30 mins
[6:03:07] gold9871: yes for 30 mins max
[6:03:08] herzlustafir: About time they shine XD
[6:03:13] s7wede: Oh they changed it to 30 mins
[6:03:14] iDazidan: mins
[6:03:16] s7wede: that is awesome
[6:03:19] Rictamar: yeh like your gold is held hostage for 24 hours
[6:03:21] SLoPPYALieN: it was changed to 30
[6:03:21] Velanthos: you have 30 mins to complete accepted orders
[6:03:24] Bogzeh: what happens after those 30min? does it get reposted or cancelled?
[6:03:25] Lostdogal: Oh ffs, if that's possible the system is rekt lol
[6:03:29] fiercepanther: I saw 30 min when I looked at wowhead

[6:03:39] moa285: So I can take one order hostage every 30 minutes? POGGERS
[6:03:47] handlebarswow: can you see who placed the order?
[6:03:48] krozym: @Towelliee  work orders have a time if not completed you get mats bk when time ends
[6:03:50] raldrik: is there a completion rate limit?
[6:03:55] handlebarswow: hard to troll if it's anonymous
[6:03:55] Metket: @Towelliee so you can fill work orders as a player finite times a day, but you can fill work orders which is getting closer (probably less then 30 mins) to make more gold
[6:04:02] Rictamar: when has reporting a player in WoW ever done anything? LUL they don't have mods anymore it seems
[6:04:05] moa285: POGGERS
[6:04:08] s7wede: You can do 30 work orders every 24h
[6:04:12] Bogzeh: so ppl can still cancel all work worders by taking them and not doing them
[6:04:17] Velanthos: it relists after 30 min
[6:04:21] Rictamar: and no one answers tickets either, its a shambles their player support in game
[6:04:22] Holysal: how many orders can you take at one time? just 1
[6:04:24] Holysal: ?
[6:04:24] gold9871: no its goes back into the pool
[6:04:36] Finansdepartementet: only 30?
[6:04:50] zodd_amhai: is that a new abilitie in the bar?
[6:04:50] DogShep: So you could get a group of people to spam streamers work orders and make it so they can't get them done?
[6:04:56] iDazidan: why bots gotta ruin everything
[6:05:08] soysos91: to be fair, all the crafters are going to have an addon to snipe best prices etc
[6:05:17] s7wede: 30 PUBLIC orders. People can still send personal work orders infinitely
[6:05:21] moa285: :tf: POGGERS
[6:05:23] abracka_: honestly good imo, stops whales and bots from grabbing everything. gives the avg player the ability to also make decent gold
[6:05:24] lando4522: @Towelliee i havent done proffessions for awhile. do i need to level any in shadowlands to do DF proffs?
[6:05:26] handlebarswow: if you take a work order and don't complete it, you shouldn't be allowed to claim that same work order
[6:05:28] DogShep: Wonder if the ignore function blocks someone taking your work order
[6:05:29] Rictamar: yeh this whole thing will be automated by addons for sure
[6:05:38] SLoPPYALieN: @s7wede That's much better. Thanks for clarifying.
[6:05:42] Sollice: I find it amazing that this is the thoughts that some people have...how to we grief the streamner. I guess I shouldn't be too surprise
[6:05:42] Dyasis: @lando4522 nope
[6:05:45] pigzip: Hey streamer, would just put it in there guild or do a personal order
[6:05:45] Finansdepartementet: streamers to good for public orders. they got them personal hired crafters
[6:05:45] Metket: yeah crafters will only do expensive ones first so if you are CHEPO AS F don't expect to get items FAST LUL
[6:05:50] ErkTheMighty: I imagine most streamers would have people willing to give them crafted items for free anyway, so I don't think it will matter lol
[6:05:53] RuthlessWelshy: LUL
[6:05:56] lando4522: @Dyasis thank you
[6:05:59] DennisTried: good evening, towel and towel enjoyers

[6:06:06] LearnedSomething: it's just business
[6:06:11] s7wede: what is your character name?
[6:06:11] Onearmyof2: looks like Blizz is putting on some live DF event.  People getting letters/invitations
[6:06:12] Revoca: or send directly to a viewer / friend they know @Towelliee
[6:06:19] Rhonabu: @lando4522 professions r split by expac so u do dont have to do past expac professions anymore u can go right to df
[6:06:21] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah I would just create personal orders
[6:06:24] pi70n: or Guild one
[6:06:32] Basedd_god: fakieFeelsGoodman
[6:06:54] Red_Dead_Redeem: I don't want the headache of dealing with some person just holding your work order
[6:07:13] hide_or_i_kill_u: @Rhonabu wait so everyone starts at 0 to start the xpac for all professions?
[6:07:15] s7wede: Yes I can
[6:07:20] Sollice: towCry
[6:07:29] LearnedSomething: and add a note
[6:07:31] DogShep: @hide_or_i_kill_u Basically yes. it's 0/100 for the new profs
[6:07:36] s7wede: It kicks me out
[6:07:38] Zivs: heavy testing going on here towF
[6:07:39] sliproach: there is going to be a discord to get crafters so people can directly get in done
[6:07:41] s7wede: says not available
[6:07:46] Rhonabu: @hide_or_i_kill_u only df profession, every expac has their own profession level

[6:09:17] s7wede: TBH the system works, and it's actually smooth
[6:09:20] Poriand: are the reagent bags different sizes?
[6:09:31] sliproach: probally been there for a while
[6:09:32] Dyasis: @pigzip yo don't when they accept it, but you will when you get the item in the mail, it will have their name
[6:09:57] pi70n: or it was for the bag that was done before the sword
[6:10:00] caback: blizz tax
[6:10:01] TomClancysRainbow: prob just a monkey sink
[6:10:02] SLoPPYALieN: @Gylduran seems good to me... like being able to gather a bunch of shit, and provide some mats for some of it... or none of them.
[6:10:05] s7wede: No it's to the Traders Consortium
[6:10:07] sliproach: just tax @Towelliee

[6:10:31] Scoodles91: you are paying for convinience
[6:10:32] Grankish: If your guild is a religion it cant be taxed
[6:10:36] r0b928: Your still using the service
[6:10:39] iDazidan: why make a work order if it's just in the guild? just ask them to make it for you
[6:10:40] TomClancysRainbow: its the tax for using the work order system instead of manually spamming g chat
[6:10:45] SLoPPYALieN: @Scoodles91 Not when someone is on a different timezone and not available online when you are online.
[6:10:45] SicDogg: @Towelliee any plans for modern warfare ??
[6:10:46] s7wede: @Scoodles91 No it can't. If you aren't a raider you might not have the reagents
[6:10:48] Buckwink: NO NEW TAXES *makes new taxes*
[6:10:49] Rictamar: @SLoPPYALieN yeh its pretty neat, I just worry about the relevance of crafted gear based on its power vs. the time it takes to get mats and craft
[6:11:00] pigzip: If you don’t want to pay the taxes, just open the trade and give him the mats
[6:11:07] AYY0B: Is it me or was the game just playing D2 music?
[6:11:08] SLoPPYALieN: @Gylduran agree.... time will tell.
[6:11:12] s7wede: 10g is nothing though. You earn 10 from looting most grey items from treasures
[6:11:19] Mahal_11532: @pigzip BoP mats
[6:11:19] Roaringkittylol: yea fuck the government
[6:11:22] SLoPPYALieN: @pigzip Some of the mats are BoP
[6:11:28] Roaringkittylol: Yoloblocks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months!

[6:11:35] Dyasis: @s7wede it's the principle man!! lol
[6:11:37] Bigbharash: please youre asking a company based in CA for no taxes. lol
[6:11:42] venom366: and uninvited from beta Kappa
[6:11:44] oOCptBlackOo: could just use guild chat and no charge. you pay for the system.
[6:11:46] Boggogroggo: I think it's hilarious they put these type of mechanics in the game when the company itself will do whatever possible to not pay taxes
[6:11:55] abracka_: about to start the warcraft revolution to stop guild taxes on work orders
[6:12:03] TomClancysRainbow: "if they can tax us for 2% on tea, then they can tax us for 50% on anything!" - american revolution
[6:12:09] Roaringkittylol: No taxation without representation!
[6:12:10] r0b928: Why use the work orders if your using a guildie? Just find them and have them make it
[6:12:21] s7wede: Can you try and create a recrafting work order for one of those swords
[6:12:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: Have we fulfilled any work orders?
[6:12:28] Rictamar: @SLoPPYALieN will also be interesting if it will be worth it to provide some of the mats to save commission costs/time or just have a blank work order and sell the mats separateyly
[6:12:29] chaotikz7: Without taxes who will fix those pot holes in Devonshire !
[6:12:31] Revoca: couldnt you say the same for personal tho...
[6:12:31] SLoPPYALieN: @r0b928 Time zones and BoP items.

[6:14:56] thom4sh: I always like to know the name of my Sandwich Artist
[6:14:58] Rictamar: once they take it?

[6:15:06] Poriand: im going to be rich with double gathering lol
[6:15:09] s7wede: Yeah just declined
[6:15:27] r0b928: Can you only accept orders that you have the recipe for?
[6:15:34] iDazidan: believe it or not, you're still gonna burn
[6:15:34] SLoPPYALieN: Perfect!
[6:15:45] SLoPPYALieN: @r0b928 Yes, have to have the recipe to accept them.

[6:16:12] Bigbharash: but you can cancel if he accepts before he makes?
[6:16:14] SLoPPYALieN: this is implemented considerably better than I would have expected from Blizzard on the first go!
[6:16:20] TomClancysRainbow: you can just take work orders that provide all mats
[6:16:24] Gragnar: @Towelliee is it 30 orders per profession?
[6:16:28] Dyasis: @SLoPPYALieN agree lol

[6:16:36] s7wede: You could go double crafting and buy your reagents from the AH
[6:16:44] Shrenko: THIS IS WHY GATHERING SHOULD BE SECONDARY PROFESSION
[6:16:46] George2001k: @towelliee I have a toon ready with mining/herb
[6:16:47] Scoodles91: or you will have to just calculate the price to include buying mats
[6:16:50] Rictamar: will be interesting what amount of work orders provide all mats vs. none or some
[6:16:54] niebvelungen: LUL
[6:16:55] Buckwink: I still dont understand work orders at all lol
[6:17:04] SLoPPYALieN: Good to know as well
[6:17:05] Mr_Pennywise_: lol
[6:17:06] DunzoCD: just use your Dracthyr alt as your gatherer and flay around
[6:17:18] Bigbharash: better be careful when entering the tip
[6:17:20] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[6:17:21] PokerFaceMoose: because they may be getting the mats and spending time on it
[6:17:21] niebvelungen: I mean its like that in IRL too you cant cancle while its beeing made
[6:17:24] r0b928: Is every crafting profession on work orders? Is alchemy on tbere?
[6:17:27] Squintymonk31: makes sense, that way someone doesn't waste mats maybe
[6:17:28] Rictamar: yeh and if you only have gold for one commission, you are held hostage
[6:17:28] SLoPPYALieN: @Bigbharash Kappa
[6:17:29] pi70n: what if you ignore the crafter now
[6:17:31] Rictamar: until it expires
[6:17:38] krozym: if you have 2 gather professions you get more gold by just sell mats
[6:17:43] lokiemkcuf: true
[6:17:46] Poriand: that might be next.
[6:17:49] s7wede: You can mine / herb while mounted in Dragonflight
[6:17:55] r0b928: What if you ignore them after they accept it???
[6:18:02] SLoPPYALieN: @s7wede Which is super awesome!!!
[6:18:04] Aeton88: that is good imagine go to someone and say i want you to doi that .... and after say i dont want it more ... that is great
[6:18:05] Rictamar: yep double gathering should be OP
[6:18:15] pigzip: That would make all the prices go down
[6:18:17] thebestwarlockk: what do you gain for making someone's item
[6:18:28] Rictamar: @thebestwarlockk their commissiom
[6:18:33] s7wede: Just took it

[6:19:28] Daarksyde: can you right click to clean the orders?
[6:19:28] TweektheProphet: Do you think creating work orders or just gathering the mats and selling on AH will get more $
[6:19:35] s7wede: Taken
[6:19:43] Rictamar: the value of a crafter will entirely depend on the market's average commission rate for that item, should be interesting
[6:19:49] gairefear: I came here to ask, when will the events and stuff for dragonflight start? I'm waiting to resubscribe until it comes out, since only the talents are out now
[6:19:54] 91Niki: D:

[6:20:38] gairefear: Ty
[6:20:51] donin: what if he never completes it
[6:20:57] Featherbow: @gairefear all info is on the worldofwarcraft website
[6:21:03] s7wede: I have 30 mins to complete it
[6:21:06] soysos91: seems petty haha
[6:21:07] Dyasis: @donin 30 min timer
[6:21:09] Aeton88: why ... is normal ...
[6:21:10] Vivelli: good to know
[6:21:11] aruken: why does it matter?
[6:21:26] niebvelungen: KEKW Bad person
[6:21:32] LegoCoin: bad person LUL
[6:21:35] LegoCoin: not really sure maybe bots?
[6:21:36] Aeton88: omg .... you report is stupid ....
[6:21:38] Revoca: when would this ever come into play tho
[6:21:45] niebvelungen: trust?
[6:21:48] Shrenko: people can be trolling
[6:21:50] LeDerpski: trust?
[6:21:52] ijuki: lol, reddit
[6:21:56] Dyasis: it would be rare, but could happen
[6:21:56] Rictamar: so can you make a work order and provide no mats at all?
[6:21:57] PokerFaceMoose: it comes into play when people want to troll people who accept work orders
[6:21:59] sliproach: inb4 apoc gets banned brecause 'bad person' Kappa
[6:22:02] papascruge: griefers are why
[6:22:04] handlebarswow: you could abuse that to get out of your order
[6:22:05] aruken: where does the trust enter into account? you'll get the same item regardless
[6:22:06] gairefear: Work order bullying
[6:22:07] Poriand: hard earned gold ;)
[6:22:09] RiskyBusines_ez: I assume you get the skill points for completing it if you craft an order?
[6:22:10] arnskid: Or be able to cancel for a fee or something
[6:22:11] abracka_: imo just add a cancel order button for the requestor, fee for canceling if a crafter already picked it up
[6:22:12] Oneeye2cu: lol
[6:22:15] HairyAreolaus: They only have 30 minutes anyway.
[6:22:16] idenkaz_: this is literally griefers dream KEKW
[6:22:19] Rygothx: He got a hold of the order so it should allow him to complete it I guess. What would you expect to happen then? He gets kicked out of the order?
[6:22:19] DogShep: Maybe add if you cancel a work order you have to wait 10m to post a work order again. Prevents griefing
[6:22:45] Ezekyler: we don't accept Reddit gold here  Stare
[6:22:45] DonnyWixx: why does it matter who makes it? you still get the item.....
[6:22:59] handlebarswow: when is anyone *ever* going to actually ignore someone within the 30 mins? not gonna happen
[6:23:00] SLoPPYALieN: @rygothx Yeah... the ignoring before hand worked, but yeah, what is the expected behavior after it being picked up... good question.
[6:23:04] Honza4545: ??
[6:23:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: sounds like solution is to ignore as soon as you heard they were bad
[6:23:07] Rictamar: @DonnyWixx because ppl can grief you by holding your order hostage
[6:23:07] BlewGamingGroup: maybe i dont want their name on my shit
[6:23:07] Aeton88: dude is like in real life ... is you go for two rings on real life for wedding and after you say i dont want them more ... and the man finish them ....
[6:23:08] Bigbharash: it says their name on it
[6:23:09] Honza4545: thats stupid
[6:23:15] s7wede: I wonder if I time out a work order if it reduces my remaining work orders by 1 for the day
[6:23:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah!!
[6:23:20] abracka_: why you gotta throw a52 down like that
[6:23:21] Ezekyler: maybe it's a Patriots fan...
[6:23:24] SLoPPYALieN: Maybe he doesn't want that dude to get the 1K gold commission because they are a tart
[6:23:24] louy: AH HELL no not fruit fucker, my items are gonna be tainted
[6:23:25] Shrenko: fruit fucker ?
[6:23:27] MerrickMoon: HeyGuys
[6:23:28] ijuki: Damn you fruitcakefucker69 PepeWhy
[6:23:28] Shrenko: LUL
[6:23:29] Revoca: idk LOL i mean either they troll u and u get ur mats back in 30 mins or they make ur item and ur mad they made it LOL
[6:23:32] Finansdepartementet: your actions should have consequences
[6:23:32] Featherbow: @Aeton88 that doesn't make any sense.
[6:23:35] themaxpower1: It makes sense if they are a griefer holding the request hostage, ignoring them should kick it back to listed
[6:23:35] ObsidianHealer: KEKW
[6:23:36] daily_outlaw: this is quite the mindscape lol
[6:23:37] baybaydoit: Why didnt you "ignore" him at the time he did w/e he did to upset you?

[6:24:01] soysos91: damnit chat
[6:24:02] iCarDog: I just want my damn shoulder man lmao
[6:24:03] Lostdogal: one stops you being griefed by crafters, one stops crafters being griefed by you...maybe...who knows.
[6:24:04] handlebarswow: yeah but you can abuse that to get out of your work order, which would be frustrating for hard working crafters
[6:24:04] GonePostal101: 1st world problems
[6:24:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: sounds like a streamer problem then Kappa
[6:24:06] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I handle the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to, I'm a people person!
[6:24:10] iCarDog: shoulders*

[6:24:13] Ezekyler: sorry FeelsBadMan
[6:24:16] dschmidt: arcane exploding Kreygasm
[6:24:16] Aeton88: @Featherbow go on IRL a bit and you will understand
[6:24:17] gairefear: Let's be honest, do you want someone named fruitfucker69 making your items anyways? /ignore
[6:24:21] DonnyWixx: idk man lol
[6:24:24] s7wede: TBH it sounds exactly like something I would do
[6:24:25] SLoPPYALieN: It is personall... MF fruitfucker ruining a52 server over here.
[6:24:26] baybaydoit: lets all calm down
[6:24:27] Revoca: you probably block them after the event not days later hahahah
[6:24:28] Rygothx: “Change of mind “ orders dont count haha
[6:24:30] Featherbow: @Aeton88 your english doesn't make any sense.
[6:24:31] kee100pure: is the crafters name still on the crafted item? damn fruitfucker... dont want his name on my shit
[6:24:39] Bigbharash: does it ignore work for their account?

[6:25:48] teqnikirl: Sure, its Brutefucker69 on Area 52.
[6:25:50] SLoPPYALieN: @fruitfucker69 - you are not loved around here!
[6:25:50] HairyAreolaus: That’s why I craft my own items, done.
[6:26:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is good for them to know that notifications are an issue
[6:26:08] s7wede: What is nice from the crafters POV is you can see what items you can get a first craft bonus on so you can get more Profession Knowledge faster.
[6:26:19] DunzoCD: thats the real DF grind
[6:26:22] SLoPPYALieN: @s7wede I love that!
[6:26:22] Finansdepartementet: imagine u get the best fuckin item and then it says fruitfucker on it
[6:26:29] Aeton88: make a order and after ignore someone because dont want more that order KEKW
[6:26:31] baybaydoit: @Towelliee is there any new pet/toy achev's for having max # of them like the new mount one??
[6:26:32] niebvelungen: And thats fine tbh
[6:26:32] Poriand: double gathering life <3
[6:26:34] gairefear: Do you have to source recipes and stuff again? Or do you get them from trainer?
[6:26:40] Oneeye2cu: hi this is furitfucker69 i love you
[6:26:40] PokerFaceMoose: @Towelliee how about you post a work order, get a 24 hour ban, and see if the person can still claim the work order?
[6:26:44] Dreyahri: don't forget to drop this in other chats! because toweliee is so kind to put it in there in every tier towLets  towGo
[6:26:45] kissesaurus: woooo, got a beta invite!

[6:26:53] Samiccus: protest*
[6:26:58] niebvelungen: @PokerFaceMoose KEKW
[6:27:14] dschmidt: Does crafting give experience like gathering does? Or is double gatherer for leveling still the play?
[6:27:17] pi70n: what if the crafter ignores you does he see your orders?
[6:27:22] Rictamar: just let me gather and sell my mats, and I'm all good :D
[6:27:41] pigzip: @towelliee do the crafter’s get exp for making the order  or knowledge point ?
[6:27:45] POWnobodyNOW: NotLikeThis
[6:27:47] MikeyGy: profession wall street
[6:27:49] s7wede: @dschmidt It only gives profession experience so you can get better at crafting. You can't level as an artificer
[6:27:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: It is cool that the game has more depth, and that it's optional
[6:28:06] pitogyro_shammy: pass or shmash overall
[6:28:08] pitogyro_shammy: ?
[6:28:13] easy_wheezy: best profs for gold?
[6:28:15] pitogyro_shammy: smash
[6:28:20] Dyasis: @Towelliee did/can you report that there should be chat notification regarding work order statuses?
[6:28:22] Justintegra31: They may. I am a big professions guy and I just got an invite today
[6:28:23] dschmidt: @dschmidt interesting, thanks!
