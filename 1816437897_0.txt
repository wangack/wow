[1:19:59] DeathLyst: this is damage control, you can tell by their body language
[1:20:00] cinnamonk3y: @shroud are you thinking of returning to Lost Ark anytime soon?
[1:20:07] lovethesucc: @DeathLyst yea. because imagine they dont do this and people find out when they buy the game, they are trying to soften the blow so people wont rage and complain
[1:20:08] tekstyleso: D: spoilers
[1:20:10] uspenguin: zombie again....
[1:20:12] z1nky_aqz: 4Head
[1:20:12] Mattyklol: So basically the character youre making off the bat during "pre season" doesn't really matter? It's just to progress through the campaign? @shroud
[1:20:13] BenaldTV: that was an obvious question
[1:20:13] NegativeCapable: ashen one
[1:20:16] masterorc15: lilaggChatting

[1:20:21] aLoNeIQ: expansion spawn revealed ;)
[1:20:21] SaturniLuna: @shroud is there any real reason to start a new seasonal character rather than just play it with your main
[1:20:23] Reckless_Monk: give me the Slam..
[1:20:25] DeathLyst: @lovethesucc  yeah but its too obvious

[1:20:58] iijonesyy: @iLamchop no just for seasons
[1:21:02] axiermo: @iLamchop you need to beat it once at any point
[1:21:03] Lhus604: no you have to finish it once first
[1:21:03] masterorc15: Will the performance be an isse though??
[1:21:05] uspenguin: no @iLamchop you have to beat it once to be able to skip it on next character
[1:21:06] nevah4eva: @kotumn 6/6/2023

[1:21:44] Mattyklol: So basically the character youre making off the bat during "pre season" doesn't really matter? It's just to progress through the campaign? And we'll make new characters for season 1?

[1:22:09] samiwamiAEYOE: @mattyklol thats how seasons work. You start over
[1:22:09] Jimmboslice: allowing skip campaign is just an admission that the campaign is not fun to play through multiple times

[1:22:20] machriphi: @Mattyklol By that logic the character you make during S1 also doesn't matter because you'll make a new on in S2.
[1:22:20] yami96: @Jimmboslice why should it
[1:22:23] HighSenpai92: he sued work on Gears of War

[2:45:17] globfather13: curse of reck is your raid spot in vanilla wow lol
[2:45:18] bubonicblade: What I find funny about EVERYONE using restedxp is that there are these dumb lines waiting for a mob to spawn... people just sit and wait wasting time.. I just move on, leave the quest unfinished, and i'm like 4 levels above a person following that guide
[2:45:18] aSeaBacon: @shroud you want recklessness to cancel a fear if a mob is running to far
[2:45:19] Magnumbars: Prevents fleeing, HUGE
[2:45:21] WesLV: curse of reck is only good in certain dungeons
[2:45:23] digitalpanhandlr: ya restedxp doesnt mean 'ez mode' it just gives you a target while your out and about, not picking up random uneeded quest.... optimizes things, that said it still will lead you to your death if your not paying attention, fairly early it tries to have you do group level task solo......
[2:45:24] lesgoduude: you just can use one curse per target

[3:18:10] Jordo2727: !drops
[3:18:12] xkitoTV: immersion with his warlock character
[3:18:13] VoxDawnbringer: @FRANTICjk I've played MMOs for many years. But I still mostly play solo. And I occasionally group up with other players. If you had played WoW, you would know what I mean.
[3:18:21] JuicySalty: those centaur can be scary if not aware lmfao
[3:18:22] Ugokaboom: Bruh you in the middle of WW3 get outta there

[3:19:09] CrungoSmile: FRANTICjk they're saying they play mmos but play them solo. They're no alone in that lmao, lots of us do things like that
[3:19:17] VoxDawnbringer: @FRANTICjk so you're one of those people
[3:19:25] Î©çÎïåÎ¶¨Í∏∞Ïû•Ïù∏: I saw a video of a 59-level Horde warrior right-clicking a Griffin handler and it was really sad
[3:19:46] hid3d: what professions do you have?
[3:19:46] king_tedward: @CrungoSmile one of the reasons why modern wow is so bad, easy accessible content for people who get nervous when someone types 'hi all'
[3:19:48] rpivs: Didn't play a lock in classic but man they look fun
[3:20:12] keagmon: invest in void walker sacrifice lvl 16 for o sh*t moments. you can hearth as well

[3:20:45] moxtli_s2: PAUSE bambzY
[3:20:51] king_tedward: @CrungoSmile sure if you level solo
[3:20:51] WenzHyper: song name pls ?
[3:20:54] VoxDawnbringer: Wow it only took him 6 hours to get this far? That's not bad at all
[3:20:57] Purrfect_pREEfect: Do you think if Blizzard makes dedicated HC servers.. it will be good for the RP scene as players will not want to leave the cities too much?
[3:20:59] LumiereBurn: !song
[3:21:01] ozaare: so.. quests?
[3:21:10] Fiegi07: south park method lol
[3:21:13] caffeinefreedietcocacola: grinding gets you a lot of gold
[3:21:16] CrungoSmile: king_tedward that's literally what we're talking about lol
[3:21:16] Kampfire7: thats the boring method
[3:21:18] kspikezx: !drops
[3:21:25] Dr_RickDaglessMD: you have to die in order to soulstone. so no
[3:21:26] Liquidator_lol: savixGigachad
[3:21:28] Wak88: @WenzHyper there is a shazam extension on crhome, really usefull
[3:21:30] firetorradar: !drops
[3:21:30] king_tedward: @CrungoSmile yea exactly, its the solo mindset that kills wow
[3:21:34] Kas50: questing in classic is rather spaced out
[3:21:41] toomers_: YEP
[3:21:44] Pakt__: westfall crabs bis
[3:21:53] samumu2123: YEP kill 50k boars to level from 14 to 15
[3:21:55] itzBlaZn: How was your days off Mike?
[3:21:56] WenzHyper: @Wak88 omg really o_O
[3:22:01] CrungoSmile: king_tedward not really, plenty of guilds and people that run with others in retail still
[3:22:02] bengalbroys: @itzBlaZn shroudWave
[3:22:03] yog1f1sh: theres an ez trick for boss tags
[3:22:14] aSeaBacon: HC server release is gonna be rough trying to get tags. Druids/mages will be OP
[3:22:24] FRANTICjk: @CrungoSmile this guy was argueing why he wants a singleplayer wow, becauase he arleady plays solo, which is very different. i am not saying anything against palying solo, but that the concept of a singleplayer is inherently different than to a MMO
[3:22:24] flaccidarrow: Rad
[3:22:26] itzBlaZn: @bengalbroys itzbla23HI itzbla23LOVE
[3:22:37] johnnyenalseed: Shrouds actually right about the grinding though, I got 2 blue BOEs killing murlocs from 22-23 in wetlands.
[3:22:51] king_tedward: @CrungoSmile game is still ruined regardless and now HC will do the same to vanilla, sad times
[3:23:05] ScenicC_: @shroud ur gonna wanna curse right after immolate since it does more damage the longer its up (minor thing i just started playing lock)
[3:23:15] yog1f1sh: doesnt every class have an instant cast tho?
[3:23:18] toomers_: Just like classic release
[3:23:22] Ugokaboom: would youi give season of mastery a try?
[3:23:23] Scuba_Swanny: switch to night shift
[3:23:27] aSeaBacon: Named mobs are too bad if they only have a single spawn. /startattack macro is just as fast as instant cast spells
[3:23:28] TheGraeme: @yog1f1sh lmao warrior doesn't
[3:23:32] aSeaBacon: arent too bad*
[3:23:34] Musclebus: everyones melee is insan
[3:23:35] cs_chance: priest has nothing
[3:23:36] Musclebus: instant
[3:23:37] land__shark_: so what youre saying is play mage and AOE farm

[3:23:46] hokipoki2: Drain life is how you tag
[3:23:46] rato_de_esgoto88: place VW on top of spawn and spam mosue wheel pet attack
[3:23:49] SvkDemolish: @yog1f1sh priest has instacast but its a dot that takes 3 seconds to do damage
[3:23:52] caffeinefreedietcocacola: if you park your pet on a spawn point and use a petattack macro that can out tag a lot of things
[3:23:54] morgott21: @cs_chance shadow word pain?
[3:23:54] johnnyenalseed: @land__shark_ Ambush spec rogue and just delete mobs 1 by 1
[3:23:58] hokipoki2: It‚Äôs insta damage
[3:24:05] talkdatish1: do you have a video on how to create macros Shroud
[3:24:05] mihai240888: wait what? Shroud playing WOW? what happend?
[3:24:06] Terapos: ranged instant cast is also better than melee instant cast
[3:24:07] weahhc: Is rogue good? since leather and melee?

[3:24:29] ThePartyFowl: @morgott21 Doesn't do damage until the first tick, 3 secs later
[3:24:29] HotChocolate_: didnt they change it so curses instant tag in classic
[3:24:31] KenM_in_FL: PepePls
[3:24:34] hokipoki2: That‚Äôs how you deal with mirror ages in wotlk dungeons alpha
[3:24:40] rato_de_esgoto88: petattack on mouse wheel is the best @shroud
