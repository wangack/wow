[0:53:05] handovdoom666: I'm gonna add something now called "DANCE MONKEY"
[0:53:06] Lord_Heia: You can typically tell if someone is going to be trash just by talking to them for 30 seconds
[0:53:08] RickPhilip: the game is the game
[0:53:10] chr47: @chadbingles so try harder and you will parse above 50 and get invites
[0:53:18] swaggybmoney: That add on would be detrimental to the game and the purpose of having an MMO
[0:53:21] Busst0pper: its really bad that log keep this but if u have a really bad group u cant parse to
[0:53:22] jbeemerks: too many words
[0:53:23] Dinomight3: @chadbingles people going in with a 14 are the people that aren't doing research or prepping. it;'s not too much to ask

[0:54:15] DonDabon: its not boss even, its trash

[0:55:19] MKDarker: son KEKW
[0:55:20] AceOfFlame: @chr47 Sadly there plenty of people who think their entittled to join other peoples raids by not wanting to bring nothing and then die every fight

[0:56:55] adam_brisbane: hutners and ele shamans love it as well
[0:56:59] miciahclay: They are just going to prevent the coins from doing anything in future phases and probably won't rework the event tbh
[0:56:59] xDomstar: follow for this statement. only saw you on youtube but this call makes you somewhat symphatic :)
[0:56:59] CeeTeeM: @gumbearcules amen

[0:57:08] chadbingles: @prfssrzaddy T.T
[0:57:13] numero5218: drop coins on death
[0:57:13] ScootSmith: simple solution, ban all mages
[0:57:16] running_backing: this is a non issue
[0:57:18] Skwidlegs: They need to add a wintersgrasp-like buff to incentivize solo blood moon, could be fun
[0:57:19] chr47: Or make it like the WSG premades, mages get their own layer with only mages LUL
[0:57:21] jbeemerks: 10x coins for solo
[0:57:25] fetza108: Melee is a ghost in stv event. So bad
[0:57:25] Rainey719: Maybe make coins not be able to turn int till the last 5 minutes of it instead of after it ends?
[0:57:25] sgt_hotpants01: turning in coins incentivizes grouping, otherwise everyone is so spread it could get dull
[0:57:27] CeeTeeM: BAN ALL MAGES
[0:57:31] Klopernikus: mage aoe nerf inc
[0:57:32] Havoc209: reduce AOE dmg in PVP in STV?
[0:57:33] Kazunya_Meowryu: @the_longcat that’s actually a good idea
[0:57:34] Mammamia007: how about you cant get cois near altars
[0:57:39] Dalbo420: Just remove aoe damage in all of STV
[0:57:41] p_fet: @Xaryu 256 is buff/debuff limit
[0:57:42] jbeemerks: 1/2 blood for grouping
[0:57:45] Widd: you cant get blood 30yds around the shrine
[0:57:45] running_backing: just ban anyone caught playing mage
[0:57:48] chickodie: MAKE BLOOD COINS A CURRENCY LIKE HONOR AND FORGET THE TURN INS ALL TOGETHER
[0:57:49] imvecks: just make it where kills give coins not blood, so you dont have to group at those locations
[0:57:54] convrge: remove the boss buff that increases coin gain
[0:57:58] arpn: i am rogue and i got my dagger and dipped, event was not fun at all
[0:58:01] Aurjn: ban mages!
[0:58:02] Spl1ker: reducing all AoE dmg during the event would solve it quick enough
[0:58:04] running_backing: is it ruining it?
[0:58:05] fetza108: FFA means no grouping......
[0:58:06] Zookwinkle: One heal buff on mages during event would solve instead of 5
[0:58:07] chadbingles: cant even disagree. rogue player literally leveling a mage as we speak lol
[0:58:07] Shake4L: ok then what about 1 shot moonkins lol
[0:58:07] jbeemerks: 5X blood for solo 🩸
[0:58:17] Kazunya_Meowryu: @xaryu did you see what @the_longcat said? if you are near a LOA during the event you take damage when you cause damage
[0:58:22] luoseno: Mages aoe is bad but also is the ranged perching on places high up and not killable by melee like trees or jump spots.
[0:58:22] nickydangles: I did a 5 stack of all rogues and got 1500 coins, I think class stacking in general is strong/OP depending on classes
[0:58:24] Dalbo420: Lets be real all the mages are just farming each other cause no one else is walking that close to the Loa
[0:58:24] Arthasfux: No more SF Xarsassin?
[0:58:26] naynayayx: extra blood for solo! great idea
[0:58:29] Busst0pper: @AceOfFlame thats why i say if u have a really bad group that vipe on every boss 2-3 times till realize whats going on you are parse doomed and than u get thows commen ohh 17%
[0:58:30] MrStLouis68: @Xaryu what if they just gave all mages their BIS/10k coins so they dont need to do stv anymore
[0:58:35] adam_brisbane: it is at one alter in the whole event if people do not want it they got 5 alters to go to
[0:58:35] running_backing: you say that as a mage, as a non mage its not a big deal
[0:58:36] imvecks: I think just  just make it where kills give coins not blood, so you dont have to group at those locations @Xaryu
[0:58:41] Okizoo: one shot moonkin was gone week 2
[0:58:44] CeeTeeM: @nickydangles I agree, I did the same thing and we had a blast
[0:58:45] chickodie: one shot moonkins=NERFED, one shot spriest=NERFED, AoE Mages=SOON2COME
[0:58:45] Widd: you cant get blood 30yds around the shrine @Xaryu

[0:59:01] Ervill1: i stopped playing sod, fixed it pretty well
[0:59:01] holymuffin90: Less blood gained from killing with aoe spells?
[0:59:01] SwyrOo: It's simple just let the buff apply to the whole zone
[0:59:02] Phrosted_: straight up aoe damage kills dont give blood - easy
[0:59:03] Teokin: just in PVP
[0:59:03] nickydangles: limit class stacking in the event
[0:59:05] enigmasvea: buff mages EZ
[0:59:06] imvecks: make it where kills give coins not blood, so you dont have to group at those locations @Xaryu
[0:59:11] Teokin: PVP should have a 5 target max AOE
[0:59:13] proxa92: remove loa buff ittl spread ppl out
[0:59:13] alexgoat94: Is this a crusader strike issue? I havent seen this on wild growth. I feel like all the dram is on crusader lol
[0:59:14] Nytsongx: remove turn in altar... why do we need to turn in coins
[0:59:15] Valencia_Pete: remove GNOMES
[0:59:15] frederikv225: best idea is to recuace damage a altar
[0:59:16] bigpharmaa: the biggest solution
[0:59:16] Frizankbeast: The best solution is what it is
[0:59:17] AceOfFlame: @Busst0pper Most people dont look towards  your first clear, anyone smart knows that first clears aren't going to give you on average high dps, most will look at 3+ kills
[0:59:18] xDomstar: Putting all Mages in Queues every 4 Hours, without mages its kinda fun
[0:59:18] chr47: Mages get their own layer with only mages @Xaryu
[0:59:19] RedChaosTV: give every class arcane explosion
[0:59:21] eyepod: Can only get blood from direct damage spells @xaryu
[0:59:23] thesirganks: make all aoe 75% less effective if you are in the event
[0:59:23] Dalbo420: But altar is where boss spawns
[0:59:23] numero5218: drop blood on death @xaryu
[0:59:25] Plokoon100: How about a debuff if the class isnt diverse?
[0:59:25] jbeemerks: closer you die to alter higher rez timer
[0:59:26] evilpr0_40k: making LOA buff zone wide would spread people out, making AoE groups less effective
[0:59:27] RedChaosTV: i dont know its a single class issue
[0:59:28] Sunashi_: limit all AoE abilities to 3 targets max during event?
[0:59:31] ForsakenTV3: they just move though and it's the same problem
[0:59:31] holymuffin90: improve blood gained from single target abilities, less blood from aoe spell kills
[0:59:32] arpn: nerf coins if u have the same as class u in your group? LUL

[0:59:51] Spl1ker: blizzard can easily solve this , theres about 50 different solutions specifically for the AoE mages
[0:59:52] fetza108: Fuck their gold.... nerds
[0:59:52] Dynther_21: furthest away from altar the more stacks you get for killing someone
[0:59:53] eldrup93: Cd on turning in coins, keep the same cap
[0:59:53] numero5218: drop coins on death
[0:59:54] alexgoat94: get rid of the mage class
[0:59:54] Phrosted_: aint nobody running 5 rets ICANT
[0:59:55] mancubthescrub: nerf coins gained from aoe effects
[0:59:58] romanisroamin: Why not just put like a 5 min cd on blood turn in?
[1:00:00] deweyeh: banning mages sounds like the only valid solution imo
[1:00:01] noyouratowell: @macjcool ^
[1:00:03] luoseno: reduced dmg, increased health on altar
[1:00:03] prfssrzaddy: Make it so you have to live a certain amount of time before being able to turn in or greater loss when dying faster @xaryu
[1:00:05] donlimpius2: beeing a roge without guild is kind annoyin
[1:00:10] arpn: hahahaha
[1:00:10] Nimbus723: having the bonus blood buff not just be near the boss would help it be super concentrated in one spot
[1:00:10] numero5218: drop coins on death @xaryu
[1:00:10] MrStLouis68: @Xaryu what if they just gave all mages their BIS/10k coins so they dont need to do stv anymore
[1:00:12] RedChaosTV: how about AOE skills give less coins
[1:00:14] numero5218: ohhh
[1:00:17] RedChaosTV: that would be the only thing you can do
[1:00:17] iamabirdttv: No aoe abilitys allowed
[1:00:17] numero5218: my b
[1:00:17] Holtann: Mage only-layer Kappa
[1:00:19] whynotz101: play with integrity
[1:00:22] millsr52: Debuff on the Alter that the longer you stand at the alter you lose coins
[1:00:26] wwombology: I like that
[1:00:30] jbeemerks: 5X blood for solo. Rez timer for altar spamming.
[1:00:32] deeman_3: minor nerf to AoE damage should be fine I would think. or a aoe cap to groups
[1:00:38] Busst0pper: @AceOfFlame bro that addon shows your average based on kills if u have just a bad try thats it (backpedal walker, 17%)
[1:00:39] Genghish: Increase blood gain for group diversity, ugh that sounded very left
[1:00:42] Brewsy_: Ya you could just give everyone a debuff that prevents you from getting coins within a certain range of the altar
[1:00:42] Pokket_Gaming: In this day in age everything will eventually become farmable/sellable content. And there is no way to prevent it.
[1:00:44] eyepod: Only get blood from direct damage spells
[1:00:49] illlili: add a timer for turn in and lose coins faster after death
[1:00:51] AceOfFlame: @Busst0pper IM not talking about the addon, the addon is banned
[1:00:52] Jehl703: Mages have enough coins to hit Rank 14 upon release. lol
[1:00:58] UnKillableSold: Look, i got your solution here, AOE spells to cost x10 what they do normally while in STV event :)
[1:00:59] RedChaosTV: coin gains based on skills used not
[1:00:59] chickodie: EVERYONE DURING THE EVENT TAKES 75% LESS AOE DAMAGE. DONE
[1:01:02] Plokoon100: I did STV with a rogue... feral.. priest pally and me as a warrior. i raked in 1700 coins.
[1:01:06] mrfaabs: Increase the number of bloods you can collect, and only allow turn in after the event
[1:01:10] Plokoon100: so.. just gota coordinate
[1:01:11] tschani27: !assasin
[1:01:17] Badaxe99: By the time they get this fixed it's only going to hurt the potato's
[1:01:17] tschani27: !assassin
[1:01:17] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[1:01:18] ponaris: I don't think this has to be fixed, boomkins and spriest were doing too much dmg and got nerfed this is a characteristic of the mage class, there has to be some uniqueness b/n classes
[1:01:21] AceOfFlame: @Busst0pper People can still look at your logs like Xaryu said by just copy paste in WCL when recruiting
[1:01:22] HiddenChin: Once per alter per event?
[1:01:25] Panic_Robot: What is the point of Boss on STV in the current situation?
[1:01:25] Shake4L: no
[1:01:31] Okizoo: moving objectives. makt the far norh and south reward higher coins for 8 mins, then switches  to another random two alters. this keeps the flow moving around the map
[1:01:31] thebridgeler: hmm I wonder if you can just stack coins and turn them in for honor next phase?
[1:01:32] Astrocyto: whirlwind?
[1:01:34] joni13271: !talents
[1:01:35] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[1:01:35] nmapst: nmapst subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hopefully you and your family is doing well. Remember to prime for diapers :)
[1:01:37] RedChaosTV: aoe skills give no coins ez
[1:01:38] coalminer69: i have all 3 rings i use the arcane  ring in stv
[1:01:39] wreckstormx: huh
[1:01:40] arpn: thats lowkey good
[1:01:42] fetza108: Why STV is not a battleground like AB. This is not FFA event.... it is an imbalanced shitshow
[1:01:47] Rambnesia: I think nerfing AoE would also buff Melee a bit
[1:01:47] BIuffwatcher: I did wonder will all the max pvp ranks just be mages because of this? @Xaryu
[1:01:48] jbeemerks: damage reduction is trash
[1:01:48] Ervill1: sexy ? thats the best word we came up with
[1:01:50] Rambnesia: Which could be good
[1:01:51] LeighUzumaki: what about warriors?
[1:01:52] donnjj: Readuce cold getting from aoe
[1:01:53] PMA_1: thats good
[1:01:53] teadanman: reduced the amount of coins gained from aoe
[1:01:55] 3raandon: would also stop lag aswell abit
[1:01:56] UnKillableSold: AOE spells to cost x10  more mana than what they normally do while in STV event
[1:01:58] ShiNe_o: living bomb and living flame?
[1:02:01] xDeathzDezignx: Madseason is getting rdy to stream
[1:02:02] donnjj: gold*
[1:02:03] Brewsy_: Farming on the altar would still be meta though because more kills. Just have to get last hit
[1:02:03] ShiNe_o: you would cripple mages
[1:02:06] Bishox: @Xaryu only bad thing would be living bomb and LF nerf
[1:02:06] henk121: it wouldnt chagne anything cuz the mages can still farm the mages then
[1:02:07] IlionDK: diminishing return for aoe
[1:02:14] HiddenChin: Only 1 turn in per alter per event?
[1:02:17] NNamtih: if more than 1 mage are in a group reduced damage by 50%
[1:02:17] Kazunya_Meowryu: @xaryu check my donation :3
[1:02:26] Bishox: @henk121 not really at 75% less damage
[1:02:27] jbeemerks: Rez timer so you can’t spam rez and aoe.
[1:02:28] deeman_3: Blood moon but 2 man duo groups instead of 5 mans would be so fun
[1:02:29] JUSTINDOLLARZ: That's me! ll
[1:02:30] JUSTINDOLLARZ: lol
[1:02:34] HeavyLiftin: @Xaryu have you seen that warrior pvp video called NERF WARRIORS on reddit?
[1:02:38] probeu: based game enjoyer
[1:02:39] rx_maryj: how are you
[1:02:40] PineapplePapaya: How about giving a bigger blood penalty the more of the same classes are in your group? Have 5 mages and recieve 15%*5 blood penalty @Xaryu
[1:02:41] asloff: only st abilities "tag" players and give coins on death
[1:02:42] tschani27: !addons
[1:02:43] StreamElements: Find Xaryu's addons & macros in discord -> discord.gg/xaryu in the #addons-macros channel
[1:02:49] catbalou2: A mage saying hes warrior LOL
[1:02:52] Pr0fan1ty: Sometimes one class is just better at something, other non mage groups still do well
[1:02:54] Nytsongx: blood moon is zero fun if youre not a mage
[1:02:56] Nandrolone11: you only get bloods on KB, why dont they just distribute coins based on participation within a kill like honor?
[1:03:00] chickodie: I enjoy the event still regardless of mages as enh shammy
[1:03:01] Okizoo: @Xaryu Moving Alter Objectives. Alters reward greater at random times moving the play focus around the map and repeated intervals but random alter location.
[1:03:02] sgt_hotpants01: sgt_hotpants01 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:03:03] detourz28: I as a ret still have plenty of fun in the Bloodmoon.
[1:03:04] watchmeaim: try with other class bro
[1:03:06] Klopernikus: nerf dots
[1:03:06] Hirshberg: try healing a blood moon lol
[1:03:06] spookyghost124: most of the sod fans on reddit dont want to hear anything negative about sod, regardless of merit
[1:03:11] booddhi: DONT HATE BLIZZARD HATE ARCANE EXPLOSION
[1:03:13] Dinomight3: @Nandrolone11 mages would get even more
[1:03:14] Busst0pper: @AceOfFlame ofc they can, champions dooing  99 parses on a 15 years old game, let them try on retail that
[1:03:16] illlili: add a cooldown to turn in coins after revival
[1:03:17] handovdoom666: @catbalou2 haha secret mage
[1:03:23] HiddenChin: Suggest solutions instead of just showing the problem?
[1:03:23] Zielepoot: Too late now since lots of people have abused it
[1:03:25] ScottyUSMC: they could try play testing their game before they release stuff
[1:03:25] rudIey: im saying screw blizzard cause im a warrior :)
[1:03:26] grkgemini94: go ahead and nerf mage aoe just give us some stamina to compensate and ill be happy
[1:03:27] ShiNe_o: dont nerf classes find a fix for the event
[1:03:28] PineapplePapaya: How about giving a bigger blood penalty the more of the same classes are in your group? Have 5 mages and recieve 15%*5 blood penalty @Xaryu
[1:03:31] NelsonGamingShow: blizzard is lizzard all they farm are L's
[1:03:35] dreamreamer: WARRIORS DOWN SO BAD LOLOL
[1:03:37] AceOfFlame: @Busst0pper Bro you saying that 99 parsers are somehow just bad players and people doing bad parsers like grays are the good ones?
[1:03:38] HeavyLiftin: @rudIey truuuue
[1:03:44] handovdoom666: MAKE WOW GREAT AGAIN NERF MAGE
[1:03:44] Kazunya_Meowryu: @xaryu check my donation dacoAWWYEAH it’s a good idea I think
[1:03:44] ponaris: I don't understand why nerf it , it is what makes mage unique and realistically how does it destroy the experience of other classes since mostly mages are farming other mages
[1:03:46] Toopaid2freestyl: Mages are supposed to find a choke point and AoE
[1:03:47] Arthasfux: my solution is play hardcore
[1:03:47] Widd: people are leveling mages still lol
[1:03:48] mrfaabs: Don't put a cap on the number of bloods collected, and only allow turn in when the event has ended
[1:03:48] piperboi: Shamans need a buff
[1:03:49] tschani27: is there an ssf addon?
[1:03:51] MrStLouis68: we should ask daddy biden what he thinks
[1:03:52] itsmistero: It's not supposed to be balanced around lvl 40, people keep forgetting we have 20 more lvls to go
[1:03:53] j8sonx: better late than never
[1:03:55] jellymann: what’s there to do once you have the mount and are bis in sod? @xaryu
[1:03:57] HiddenChin: Season 2 Phase 1
[1:04:00] hulkdieselx: i would rather mages keep their infinite blood rather than get my  divine storm nerfed
[1:04:02] UnKillableSold: AOE spells to cost x10 more mana than what they normally do while in STV event
[1:04:07] enigmasvea: rofl
[1:04:13] Mammamia007: i think they should nerf hunter because of that
[1:04:14] jbeemerks: Rez timer if you die on altar. ez pz
[1:04:15] irate____: they buff everyone but warriors everything is possible
[1:04:17] postyy_tv: having black lotus spread around stv (if this is a 60content pvp thing) @xaryu
[1:04:18] darkol33t: @Xaryu there is exp 100% buff on SOD?
[1:04:20] eatmyprotein: what you think about priests in sod, first time playing a priest in wow so cant compare to classic
[1:04:23] sgt_hotpants01: what if there was a stacking debuff on groups for every one of the same class in that group? 5 mage groups get 5 stacks.
[1:04:30] iplayhots: give punishment for aoe farming and or give rewards for mages doing things other than aoe farming
[1:04:33] dreamreamer: INCREASE THE RANGE OF THE LOA IMO
[1:04:34] Ervill1: before people knew about the boss people would fight just about anywhere
[1:04:35] ucubetv: rez timer on death by alter is decent idea also
[1:04:38] ggbr0sky: just take the bloodbuff away in the first place
[1:04:40] UnKillableSold: @darkol33t yes it went live yesterday for US today for EU
[1:04:41] HiddenChin: @Xaryu Sorry for spamming but what do you think about 1 alter turn in per alter per event?
[1:04:43] elbee89: make the boss scary as fuck
[1:04:45] rudIey: especially for the lag
[1:04:48] Busst0pper: @AceOfFlame no i say its nonsense the whole system just incurage desocialize ppl
[1:04:48] o_lark: if anything they just take stv as a lesson and implement change in the next event
[1:05:00] lebr0naims: Make it so the more peopel in the same area, the less coins
[1:05:01] moka_master: needs to be like more of a battle royal, not just a cluster
[1:05:03] TheSward: @xaryu did you see the hotfix "Kha'damu no longer drops extraneous items." ? what do you think that means
[1:05:03] 420grillkex: CurseForge working for ppl?
[1:05:05] Doimos89: pls don't nerf it untill i can farm it abit as well
[1:05:06] Pr0fan1ty: Groups adapt and just hang back off alter picking mages off
[1:05:07] AceOfFlame: @Busst0pper it doesn't and trying to bring in retail is bad argument
[1:05:25] holymuffin90: @Xaryu move the boss so he doesn't sit on an altar, make him patrol more. mages only sit on the altar that he's at. so if he isn't at an alter, mages cant continuously congregate at one spot
[1:05:28] 4wardsjack: here’s an idea - if you don’t like it go to a different altar?
[1:05:30] Kazunya_Meowryu: @xaryu  I think my donation message might help a lot
[1:05:31] lebr0naims: @Xaryu You make coin gain radius based, so the more people in an area the less coins you get
[1:05:33] jbeemerks: Rez timer if you die on altar
[1:05:34] jellymann: whats next now that you have mount and are basically bis? @xaryu
[1:05:35] lolzandis: just make it a battle royal
[1:05:37] L_o_g_a_n: why nerf mage just buff every class
[1:05:40] dreamreamer: THEY NEED TO MAKE THE EVENT A SEMI BATTLE ROYAL WHERE THE LESS TIMES U DIE THE MORE BLOOD YOU GET. TOP TEAMS GET PORTED INTO ARNEA AND HAVE A FIGHT TO DEATH FOR EXTRA BLOOD. ALL DEAD PEOPLE PORTED INTO STANDS TO WATCH!!1
[1:05:43] NelsonGamingShow: was the boss killed?
[1:05:47] MrStLouis68: what if they cap how much blood you can get
[1:05:51] deeman_3: AOE immunity/ resistance near altars!
[1:05:52] UnKillableSold: AOE spells to cost x10 more mana than what they normally do while in STV event
[1:05:54] darsoldis: I need aoe damage for leveling though </3
[1:05:58] askinforit: @dreamreamer lol
[1:06:01] myshdws: too much areola
[1:06:01] postyy_tv: black lotus kind of resource spread around stv @xaryu
[1:06:05] CmdEagleEyes: just make it actually a FFA no grouping
[1:06:07] tetenqt: HUH
[1:06:09] AceOfFlame: @deeman_3 that wont work, people just pick a spot not near an atler
[1:06:11] Pontzka: Make Altars Safe zones?
[1:06:12] jellymann: whats next now that you have mount and are basically bis? @xaryu
[1:06:18] xDomstar: Making Points of Interests somewhere. Putting multiple Bosses, 50+ ppl around the boss, then Blood earned will be reduced. And Bosses have to be visible on map and you have to see if its +50 people around
[1:06:20] camidpsgod: just reduce aoe dmg during the stv event
[1:06:22] akhiseuss: @xaryu if u die too many times in a short period of time u should get a debuff that decreases the coin gain
[1:06:23] arpn: what if i want the mount in my rogue ?
[1:06:24] HiddenChin: Playa gon play
[1:06:26] Rainey719: Gamers are gonna Game
[1:06:27] SippinSimpSyrup: Bro just remove the ab rep from the event and it doesnt matter since the reward is just a mount
[1:06:27] slapshotsd: stacking debuff for spamming the same move, either resources (mana %) or damage
[1:06:28] BrewTTV: Damage reflect on the altars
[1:06:30] arpn: it aint my fault my class sucks
[1:06:30] jgrizz0311: the bad part for the aoe mage strat is when the boss is away from alt.. its almost not worth aoe farming. so have the boss move further distances
[1:06:36] JukezZA: Remove the top and bottom altars so people are less spread out and only let them hand in at the end at 1 of the 3 altars
[1:06:38] spookyghost124: yeah that commenter was not being serious
[1:06:39] SpaceCowboy0811: @brewttv lmfao
[1:06:40] fetza108: Firstly they said FFA. It is clearly not FFA.
[1:06:51] SippinSimpSyrup: They need to remove ab rep from the event
[1:06:52] Tyrfi: make it so you can only turn in 1 time per altar, on put a CD on it
[1:06:55] Drobstep: !assassin
[1:06:55] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[1:06:58] jbeemerks: solo getting 5X blood. and stacking Rez timer for dying on altar 🩸🩸🩸
[1:07:08] lIlREDFOXlIl: aint STV NOW??!??!?!
[1:07:12] SpaceCowboy0811: The worst feeling is getting a solid farm off... Than going to turn in and having 5 mages spawn on top of you
[1:07:13] jellymann: whats next now that you have mount and are basically bis?? @xaryu
[1:07:13] adam_brisbane: can I ask who has actually said they do not enjoy it?
[1:07:14] ferknasty: as an SPriest, i target a mage and spam mind sear and aoe everyone around the mage
[1:07:17] SlapdickWoWplayer: It is annoying to do...but I found charing into mage groups and WW and cleaving(after checking their health) gets me coins fast...I die a lot...but it works well
[1:07:19] Bearhans: my team has been using shadow bolt volley on the mages and putting living flames on them to taxi our damage to the altar
[1:07:22] myyrlidon: xar did you hear MC is a 20 man raid
[1:07:23] Mackdaddyprim3: maybe increasing mana cost for AOE spells during event
[1:07:29] Brewsy_: Give everyone a debuff within 50 yards of the altars that prevents you from gaining coins. Easy
[1:07:32] arpn: people are crying because you are afk in the altar spamming 2 buttons LUL
[1:07:33] knifeparty818: i think less AOE damage taken is the only way otherwise there will just be mele cleave groups dominating
[1:07:37] AceOfFlame: @jgrizz0311 They could make it if your near an alter, you cant get the boss buff
[1:07:37] Busst0pper: @AceOfFlame why is that i play retail and have seen few new gamer who tryed retail and fail bad but have top parses in classic, its nothing to brag about your parses and nog good to categorize ppl based on that website
[1:07:38] SippinSimpSyrup: There is no reason to be upset if they removed the ab rep
[1:07:44] SpaceCowboy0811: Blizzard forums are slightly better than reddit
[1:07:48] nmapst: make people spawn at random ish ghost, but at the same ghost withn the same grp maybe.
[1:07:50] arpn: is facts
[1:07:56] jellymann: whats next now that you have mount and are basically bis? @xaryu
[1:07:59] QQkaChews: Cheer100
[1:08:02] Ervill1: suggestions to improve gameplay = crying. nice login
[1:08:02] MrStLouis68: @Xaryu they should turn it into a battle royale, you get one life to get coins and that it
[1:08:10] Ervill1: logic*
[1:08:12] SilentWisco: pve set
[1:08:16] spookyghost124: the sod fans really dislike hearing any criticism about their game of choice.
[1:08:19] adam_brisbane: the mount
[1:08:19] TheSward: @xaryu did you see the hotfix "Kha'damu no longer drops extraneous items." ? what do you think that means
[1:08:19] AceOfFlame: @Busst0pper Dude retail parsing isn't anything hard either, trying to say that 99 parsers in classic would be bad in retail is just trying to create a narrative in your head, you have absolutely no idea
[1:08:26] Riggidy_Ray: Is it realist to say that this game hasnt been balanced since release so why would anyone expect it to be balanced now?
[1:08:27] SippinSimpSyrup: Just remove ab rep and then all the rewards are cosmetics basically
[1:08:30] ponaris: Why shouldn't mages aoe farm since that is their signature I have a rogue alt too and I don't get affected at all by the mages farming the altar
[1:08:31] DrSwole: Gnomer is at the perfect difficulty for PUGs IMO @Xaryu
[1:08:31] crucifoe: Gnomer is a good raid
[1:08:34] Phrosted_: the worst part of gnomer is the first boss RP
[1:08:38] arpn: The Mount Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:08:44] darkmagi2: @Xaryu seems easy enough to me, just make players not worth any blood at the altar
[1:08:53] agren13: Playing for fun, seems good
[1:08:55] fartguyl: @Xaryu The streamer server seems crazy compared to others. STV event on my server had a few AOE mages but it was not a problem at all.
[1:09:03] adam_brisbane: maybe make alt and have it levelled in 3 days
[1:09:04] SpaceCowboy0811: Smells like an OTK duel tourney to me
[1:09:09] zarillon1: can u react to bean beep test
[1:09:18] macjcool: do they become pacified at the alter?
[1:09:22] Ausden: they will still grief ppl that dont need coins
[1:09:23] sgt_hotpants01: what if there was a stacking debuff on groups for every one of the same class in that group? 5 mage groups get 5 stacks.
[1:09:23] Pontzka: Make Altars Safe Zones @Xaryu
[1:09:25] tsetse2fly: I think last 4 bosses in Gnomer is fun, first 2 is boring
[1:09:26] shakathedon: altar debuff
[1:09:26] bruhy04: or just make a alter a safe zone
[1:09:27] Pr0fan1ty: Groups would just camp the alter to be toxic
[1:09:28] UnKillableSold: AOE spells to cost x10 more mana than what they normally do while in STV event
[1:09:32] gregfork: Have we talked about Kha'madu not dropping " extraneous loot" anymore? so does that mean he drops REAL loot now?!
[1:09:35] eyepod: Or at least a sliding scale of blood based on how close you are to the alter
[1:09:41] x_praxy_x: Make raids less linear, like the Karazhan raid back in the day
[1:09:41] bushthebug: just dont make bonus blood from being near boss
[1:09:47] Mammamia007: this also fixes ppl camping near altar which is annoying

[1:15:00] bushthebug: 300% is technically x4
[1:15:04] SippinSimpSyrup: The answer is blizzard is too stupid to actually determine who is and who isnt a bot so they just ban
[1:15:16] odstat: honestly the report system ruins the game cause blizzard will never actually check whether its what the report claims then you gotta sit a week ban for no reason

[1:17:11] Viisionz74: yeah ppl still play retail
[1:17:12] budmodeos: just paused my kid’s wow accounts until September. They play retail. @xaryu
[1:17:14] bryn_dee: the retail team is focused on the 3 new expacs they announced, the classic team just has more time and freedom within the game
[1:17:18] momoforever22: Hearthstone-level of communication
[1:17:21] MKDarker: nobody's perfect
[1:17:22] asloff: Xaryu and SoD dev collusion conspiracy theories are starting xarGKappa

[1:17:36] niigghtmare34: retail is working on expansions, there really isnt much to tune on retail now
[1:17:39] BloodMage90: @budmodeos let em play if they like it Sadge
[1:17:40] ItsANoBrainer: Small teams will always feel more personal than tremendously large teams. See OSRS.

[1:17:54] jewfest: balancing is easier than sod
[1:17:55] davesodave: classic is just better
[1:17:58] jewfest: in sod
[1:17:59] odstat: dh needs nerf hello? no changes need to be made
[1:18:02] iplayhots: retail is the i leik turtles of WoW
[1:18:03] thefpsguru: SoD ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:18:03] BloodMage90: retail gets so much unnecessary hate smtimes
[1:18:06] agren13: I think the classic team probably also has less corporate steps to go through with their changes. I can imagine that changes for Retail has to go through a lot more people before being applied
[1:18:06] Thomasdurso: it’s weird when they get their full freedom back to do what they want they actually get to do some good stuff
[1:18:11] odstat: retail is now demonhuntercraft
[1:18:12] magnaeus: retail has to worry about pvp balance, arena championship, mythic dungeon contest
[1:18:13] budmodeos: No it’s because they aren’t playing right now. All that is left is grinding Dragonflight dungeons, and we’re bored of them.
[1:18:15] Reck179: HOUSE OF CARDS
[1:18:16] Zielepoot: They dont balance pvp
[1:18:18] Thomasdurso: seems like they were held back
[1:18:24] Jalapinot: SoD team made has made multiple PvP events out of scratch, while retail team has... done... uh... something Im sure
[1:18:25] Mestema17: retail is already working on war within...  they don't have the same time that the classic devs do.
[1:18:25] thrushmaster69: Retail is just an example of how it went wrong
[1:18:27] SippinSimpSyrup: Were just beta testing for classic plus
[1:18:28] Ardal_Obe: Things actually matter in retail :P
[1:18:28] ItsANoBrainer: yup
[1:18:30] Rainey719: the numbers are also easier for the dev teams to balance and deal with in Classic compared to era @Xaryu
[1:18:34] zer0_the_legend: Retail gas become far too bloated and complex imho
[1:18:36] Rainey719: compared to retail*
[1:18:37] Nerio27: less cooks too
[1:18:37] zer0_the_legend: Has*
[1:18:40] Spikeqc: HACKERMANS
[1:18:41] r4men_noodle: 100%
[1:18:44] arpn: you kinda are
[1:18:44] jewfest: more abilities
[1:18:46] JukezZA: yeah 100% right
[1:18:47] niigghtmare34: if they screw up something on sod its not as big of a deal
[1:18:48] kagawah: SOD priest or hunter?
[1:18:48] j8sonx: ths what i thought too
[1:18:49] tristansafonov: yeah that’s correct
[1:18:53] jbeemerks: everything in retail has all the fun balanced out of it
[1:18:53] ralphh1541: it's a fair assumption
[1:18:53] Klevsen: Also SoD dont have a competative scene right
[1:18:55] fetza108: I love solo content in retail
[1:18:55] ItsANoBrainer: You got it.Small teams will always feel more personal and quicker than tremendously large teams. See OSRS.
[1:18:56] MatiRey88: probably u are correct
[1:18:58] warmupwarri0r: they are just focused on the expansion I think.
[1:19:00] Desolate_e36: more classes
[1:19:00] Busst0pper: @Xaryu you are right , they do rework to classes
[1:19:02] chalupacabras: You just described the scope of Classic vs Retail. And you know what you do when the Scope is larger on one project versus the other? You expand your team!
[1:19:02] dbvaluation: 100%
[1:19:05] Rozzoirl: retail is smart and separates the buffs/nerfs for pvp/pve
[1:19:06] sullyman13: engineer here: sod is an experiment meaning devs have full reign on trying new things and reporting the results back to the team
[1:19:11] HiddenChin: Scrum master here, I am not sure that is correct from coding, mnore for design and testing.
[1:19:13] windowlol: I just got here but yea ur right.
[1:19:13] zer0_the_legend: Fewer variables makes for less complexity
[1:19:17] IronTalonGaming: No melee ability should fall off after death
[1:19:19] mathematician3: classic is like flask, while retail is django
[1:19:19] chickodie: thousands of developers on a single game... every one of them is gonna want their signature ingame. Thats all the useless features and aggrovating expansions.
[1:19:20] crazedllama7: what addons do you use?
[1:19:27] lebr0naims: Yes but they likely have the same devlopers who created retail still on the team, where they likely dont have the same developers they had when vanilla came out which is why you see so many simple issues
[1:19:33] cory_lockman: vanilla
[1:19:35] Klevsen: The Competetive scene probably comes into play here right? or updates etc dont affect the Competetive scene?
[1:19:35] ferknasty: 12
[1:19:50] detourz28: Purging is annoying!

[1:20:49] Loodimus: 70/30 70% easy clear

[1:20:58] adam_brisbane: ziqo video shows it
[1:20:58] Nandrolone11: its not easy to find good healers

[1:21:18] rns_aurelius: how many people would have a meltdown if the raid was difficult though?
[1:21:18] graziNNN: I walked into gnomer first time and wiped once on last boss, it's easy
[1:21:19] arpn: Ziqo videos sums it up pretty good
[1:21:20] gbish00: If you have no logs impossible to get logs
[1:21:21] Spiezor: @Xaryu NGL easier to check logs on pugs then raid with guild that has shit logs
[1:21:21] jbeemerks: some classes/specs wait forever to get groups. it’s brutal
[1:21:24] didactylos6: raid is ez but most pug randoms dont kill last boss
[1:21:29] Loodimus: it’s kinda that and I don’t necessarily like the logs but some players don’t pay attention or want to learn they just go in and push buttons lol
[1:21:30] irate____: depends on the server
[1:21:32] Udenwo: I check logs of the ppl I join. and leave if they are bad
[1:21:32] bryn_dee: Oooh Xaryu undercover video series could be dope but would mean you'd be off stream more and... Idk i like your stream as some background noise lol
[1:21:34] mfamnotenti: it is easy

[1:21:49] monthescene: not have gnomer gear as pre raid bis
[1:21:50] irate____: lonewolf server finding a tank and healer is awful there is none
[1:21:50] bloodstuck2000: I found an active guild P1 and it has saved me from all the issues
[1:21:50] boblewis13: well as a 99 parser myself i wouldnt know SoBayed

[1:40:05] darkmagi2: if you have the mark or the reward (scroll for buff) in your bank, then the mark won't drop
[1:40:05] pfrospfrost: @Xaryu its the drop that gives u the battle hym buff any mob/boss drops it during event
[1:40:05] juicedupjake69: have to kill guard to get the quest every week thats how you get the old 5% damage buff for BFD

[1:40:15] Phoenix3215: I disagree as a pve Andy.   Ashenvale > STV

[1:40:25] shadowvypers: SoD is a great platform for introducing and testing new and innovative ideas
[1:40:31] bushthebug: @Xaryu are you going for the STV boss kill?
[1:40:33] Soberphobic: @Tyrfi nah just an average SOD player tbh
[1:40:34] inspect4: ashenvale was so fkin trash
[1:40:37] fetza108: This game kills the melee section. Everyone will be a caster LUL
[1:40:37] vejitas4: @xaryu you pick quest item from the one of the bosses in ashenvale event or one of theadds next to the bosses and  when event is over turn it in asstrannar
[1:40:38] lolzandis: ashenvale was so boring

[1:41:03] hoodboyF: how do we armory in sod
[1:41:04] elmeryex: Is it worth buying wow rn? I've played on pservers for a long time and enjoy the game alot, but i've heard that wow's economy is getting botted alot, the players are quitting etc. Sorry if mentioning pservers is against the rules cant find anything about it on your twitch or discord.

[1:41:06] Lamira: whats with you and killing druids D:
[1:41:07] animeisrealxo: anytime a pvp event is raid vs raid, its boring its just pve, its walk in 40yards and instantly die.
[1:41:08] grimnor375: they need to get rid of the blood turn in nonsense and just let us collect coins
[1:41:09] SilentToastJob: whats that magic amp animation proc?

[1:41:27] ethans32: @elmeryex SoD is a blast

[1:41:32] TB8008: Whats the server faction balance like now?
[1:41:32] fetza108: Ashenvale would have been a lot better but everyone is a meta gamer...
[1:41:32] Copertone: tell that to the horde
[1:41:33] sigisha96: @Xaryu what zone at 50 would you like to see be a pvp zone?
[1:41:34] Erkal7: how many items u have to open gurubashi chest to get trinket

[1:41:47] Yamamoto78: killing someone lower level than you should be a dishonorable kill
[1:41:48] Jaysmoke: i had a 40 rogue camping me for 30 mins on my lvl 33, wasnt fun
[1:41:48] alexgoat94: did you see Twitch's blog for 2024?
[1:41:48] cookie_jayy: the way I think about it, they would jump in and help a level 40 kill you and 2v1 you if they had the chance
[1:41:49] meeskas: @elmeryex i feel the same as you, i think its fun
[1:41:50] kswissbaby: I agree if you get rid of the blood turn in and just give coins STV event becomes wayyyy better

[1:42:06] resume___: !talents
[1:42:06] joblessraccoon: if it wasnt for the boss, people would actually roam and have better fights, instead they locked us all in around the boss, either make it that theres more bosses on the map or no boss altogether... or just buff bloods

[1:42:13] FIREMAGZZ: I liked ashenvale is a large scale pvp event you get more rep for actively pvping and defending your factions bosses. our community turned it into a pve event
[1:42:15] JUMJUMnoMi: uh whats that saber :O
[1:42:15] Towenaar2: ye ban mage squads
[1:42:20] sigisha96: @Xaryu what zone at 50 would you like to see be a pvp zone?

[1:42:48] booddhi: altar
[1:42:50] DanPlaysChess: honestly creating twitch memes has become a lost art. Broadly speaking there are two camps. "Try Hards" who think every comment that isn't serious is a "troll" vs. 24/7 memers, who can't separate a joke from reality.
[1:42:50] kswissbaby: they just need to get rid of the Loa
[1:42:53] elmeryex: @meeskas Thought about buying a 1 month subscription like 3 months already, but 11euro is much for me. Im just a teenager that doesnt do much money
[1:42:53] adrianplzstop: you mean altar
[1:42:55] SilentToastJob: altar not loa
[1:42:57] Kisotope_: @Xaryu self imposed mage group ban? be the solution you want to see
[1:42:58] RedChaosTV: its a feels bad when you get 500 coins as a non mage, and the mage gets 2-4k coins per event
[1:43:01] alexgoat94: then they will do it somewhere else
[1:43:05] ethans32: NODDERS
[1:43:07] CHICKENARMSANDLEGS: or maybe remove the boss or add more bosses to avoid everyone being at one spot
[1:43:10] AgentIce99: 5 mages in a pack away from the altar is still really aids, but that would be an improvement
[1:43:11] hutchyy917: @eclipsethenextone unfortunately will never hbe the way we play games ever again :(
[1:43:11] macjcool: I been spamming inv at mages for 20 mins and nothing xar!
[1:43:12] witticism44: why can't they just reduce aoe dmg by 90% and call it a day?
[1:43:13] SippinSimpSyrup: Bro remove the ab rep and the event doesnt matter
[1:43:17] SlapdickWoWplayer: @Kisotope_ he is doing a "normal" grouop for this event i believe
[1:43:18] realandtruephobe: Would they need to make some kind of buff?
[1:43:21] grimnor375: just stop the whole turn in garbage. no reason for it to be in the event
[1:43:23] bushthebug: @xaryu what about making it so being around boss doesnt give extra blood so that people arent tunneled at one altar
[1:43:25] Cal_Ki: ig you get attached just run to alter
[1:43:29] cookie_jayy: just delete mages
[1:43:33] 4wardsjack: ok if we do that let me also get my mount real quick

[4:55:42] Munchagramz: to make money on twitch you arealdy above the 10% of streamers
[4:55:43] BoskatGG: I think as long as you can make a living, not necessarily be rich, that is enough and fine
[4:55:45] wtfcantfindname: of course, because we all think about the "big" streamers which is 0,1% of streamers
[4:55:46] Dr0ddy: At least $1

[4:58:01] SghettiBoy: I cant wait for lvl 60 sod
[4:58:02] bisbrah: When streamers say "top 1%" isnt all streamers so you can't use the word "streamer"... it's like when actors say not all actors make money. It's not a job title until you live off it. Deflecting that fact is simply misdirection.
[4:58:06] Smoakezy: NFL players make more than junior high football players
[4:58:06] cookie_jayy: true

[4:58:36] SgtPepperTTV: entertainment industry is how it is Play in a band? You might be broke af but Taylor Swift is a billionaire, plenty of career musicians make 50k+. Same with sports.
[4:58:38] TokerTy420: @daddycool_b I don’t think he’d be doing this for 12yrs makin nothing lol
[4:58:39] largist_: OTK also has many other hustles on top of streaming

[5:00:41] matheusin_42: I don't even like retail but I really want to watch xar come back to it

[5:07:09] theDRG: Retail is already introducing the Hero Talent trees, dont know if all have been revealed, but seems like a good opp to implement the "SoD Specs"
[5:07:11] themanjake2020: the problem is how many classes and balance retail has
[5:07:12] deepfriedbrainforlunch: fun is not allowed in retail
[5:07:12] probeu: it wont help that much. people just dont want the higher responisbility roles.
[5:07:18] joejoejosephhh: more healers then tanks
[5:07:18] cclusii: rogue tanks make no sense
[5:07:19] Rainey719: works with how the gear's stats also change depending on specss

[5:12:16] kynnad23: any /who 60s yet?
[5:12:18] diegombraga97: Xar, i have two questions for you. 1) What do you think about asmongold opinion over banish addons from retail? 2) What do you think about restedxp for leveling?
[5:12:18] TikiTopper: i could never be a streamer, i cant pronounce any of the addon names without sounding stupid
[5:12:25] Lizuket: elwynn Listening
[5:12:29] direwolf575: if you could only have one addon, which addon would you have?

[5:13:58] derpyllama420: they made the bosses harder because of addons already
[5:13:59] Mahca_: wish we could have no addons that announce mechanics but ui is fine
[5:14:00] betterchetter: Never give them candy
[5:14:01] llhybrisll: Does a lot of people still play HC on American Servers? EU is sadly kinda dead and i miss HC so i think about switching on US Servers
[5:14:03] Mind_G0bl1n: @kriethos xarGlory
[5:14:07] DanRas08: Yeah but the kid is crying either way so just let them cry
[5:14:09] ScryerTV: dont make us cry
[5:14:09] TikiTopper: yah alot of people can't play without some addons....its gone so far past quality of life addons
[5:14:09] gUiLtY07: punk hazard in a nutshell

[5:14:26] iBanEvader: there's nothing wrong with addons, elitism and efficiency mentality is what's wrong @Xaryu
[5:14:26] igazadvandavid: intact
[5:14:28] diegombraga97: And what about the restedxp question?
[5:14:31] SghettiBoy: I could see it happening with an experimental server like SOD
[5:14:33] cok0: i wish they ban addons in all classic versions
[5:14:33] myyrlidon: why doesn it look like your running so fasat
[5:14:35] realandtruephobe: Yeah but in your analogy, you still need to take the candy from the kid even if he cries
[5:14:37] Maiqthehighking: you gotta buy the addons in the bethesda creation kit now
[5:14:37] reallyeric: whats wrong with addons then?
[5:14:39] theDRG: If I didn't spend 15hours a week making weakauras I probably wouldnt have interest in this game
[5:14:39] teknison: Implement some of the QoL changes that addons provide into the base game.
[5:14:39] ggbr0sky: the kids gonna cry for a whiler but not forever
[5:14:40] TheWhiteRabbitxX: uhhh I was used to paying $500 for rent and they took that away….
[5:14:44] Kanooog: @deeesou it isn't... it's Xarsasintwo no spaces.
[5:14:45] Skullkandy2933: @Xaryu $69 for 69 roll, two tries
[5:14:46] ashraf_ma: @Xaryu Unless they implement addons in the game's UI like they have been this expac
[5:14:46] underpaidcarrot: Cant take guns away from Americans
[5:14:47] Mahca_: ban addons and make the devs just put stuff in game
[5:14:49] hot6auce: WeakAuras is SO powerful
[5:14:49] holynickel: what releam u on @xaryu
[5:14:50] baldanduseless: aa SF hardcore server withno addons would go hard @Xaryu
[5:14:52] iBanEvader: true addons make it easier
[5:14:57] KairuruTV: i mean....addons can be taken away, we cant change the mentality millions of people bud
[5:14:58] MistaWinna: they will just add stuff to base game so that you wouldnt need addons

[5:15:02] crazyt4c0: being efficient is just part of being human
[5:15:05] uelischwertt: what do you have target enemy bound to?
[5:15:05] myyrlidon: why does it look like your running so fast
[5:15:08] igazadvandavid: dmg meter is not the problem. the minmaxing addons are the problems i think
[5:15:10] lilmacd22: Bro... its time.... long time since, time to return. back to retail, play with tha boo and get it rolling
[5:15:21] blazzedzz: The game being designed around people having 10000 add ons is ulta lame
[5:15:23] cxn_r: @baldanduseless that would have less players than HC does now
[5:15:24] kriethos: @williamrosengrim2 if u do quests while in the world and groupoed u lose the buff but not if u walk to the instanz
[5:15:27] VdoTapes: I think I got banned for accidentally showing Add ons on wow’s reddit (I didn’t know)

[5:15:30] CyprusAve: What lvl did u die? :(
[5:15:33] ashraf_ma: They are implementing addons in the base UI @Xaryu it's a way to dealwith it
[5:15:37] celestius11: yeah people still are elitist without addons
[5:15:37] WraithIIB: blizz should just choose essential addons and build them in, f the rest
[5:15:39] TheWhiteRabbitxX: pvp is trash anyway. just scrap addons
[5:15:40] JukezZA: Hey guys, Xaryu here :D
[5:15:45] herrxr: @igazadvandavid DMG Meter is literally minmaxing hahah?.. Especially due how detailed they are.
[5:15:49] espi: 69% health
[5:15:52] Milllzee: The point usually raised is that if you remove the third party addons then Blizzard would be required to "fix their game" to give you access to the neccessary stuff

[5:15:54] Catalystic_Sudo: Dps meters give so mich anxiety. if im having N off day im scared ill get kick 😭
[5:15:56] Vishfeast: It's crazy that WoW has the skill ceiling it does so you can conitniously learn mechanics and situational things where you can legit be a nothing to a hero
[5:16:09] SaucyRMD: It's like League of Legends, you hate losing more then you love winning
[5:16:13] SghettiBoy: I love what Ziqo has been doing on sod - just pulling anyone from trade who wants to run gnomer to run it and SUPRISE they clear gnomer every time
[5:16:14] Vishfeast: to me its wild how then people complain
[5:16:14] Zolshy89: Delusional
[5:16:18] typi5: Ideally you wouldn't even be in westfall right now, be careful lol
[5:16:21] Webbyster_: Xarsassinthree when???
[5:16:24] igazadvandavid: dmg meter is just a nice thing for you to enjoy your character, to know that you are doing your role well
[5:16:26] PaxedUP: If Blizzard wants to rewrite the script they can do-so by making a new IP or game
[5:16:28] Krim707: you can always control your own game's systems at any time

[5:16:44] TheWhiteRabbitxX: if you don’t pay double what you’re used to paying for rent you get evicted. doesn’t matter if you cry. things change
[5:16:44] orcuuh: legend
[5:16:49] kriethos: @juice42069 well, in like 5 year we will mby get it
[5:16:49] igazadvandavid: steals away the game itself
[5:16:52] Dinomight3: PAID ACTOR
[5:16:52] diegombraga97: So, you think that asmongolds opnion is kind of delusional? I say this because i kind understand and agree. Most of his opinions about wow are like that.
[5:16:54] illyiochess: u prefer shaman or pala
[5:16:55] Virzy: what about macros that play the game for you? ie shadowstep, kick, grapplehook back to original target in one button
[5:16:59] Maiqthehighking: help = delete xarKappa
[5:17:01] realandtruephobe: The STV boss was the most fun part of P2 because it was a mystery, and wasn't able to be min maxed.
[5:17:03] orcuuh: lol
[5:17:04] grizz430: the toxicity of the player base is out of control, not necessarily elitism, but toxic elitism is a part of it @Xaryu
[5:17:06] myyrlidon: why doesn it look like your running so fasat
[5:17:09] taylorsdank: so this is a gloryless run?!
[5:17:10] Pokket_Gaming: No glory! lol
[5:17:11] adina_v_: Isnt he a rapper
[5:17:12] Thrively: we remember haha
[5:17:14] Vugaddii: like a true rogue
[5:17:20] Trainingtobeperson: zero glory run?
[5:17:21] ChildishNA: rogues don't ask for help they take it
[5:17:23] iBanEvader: @Xaryu LFG bulletin board is for example one of the best addons created and it makes the game more enjoyable.
[5:17:27] supreror: !ASSASSIN
[5:17:27] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:17:31] Pokket_Gaming: True true. That's fair.
[5:17:34] slimthicknasty9999: what lvl is deadmines
[5:17:38] Krim707: nothing would happen if addons were turned off. only less convolution
[5:17:43] diegombraga97: @slimthicknasty9999 17-26
[5:17:48] slimthicknasty9999: thanks
[5:17:50] guccigibbs: @Xaryu Ahmpy is playing honorbound quest RP, completes EACH quest he accepts.
[5:17:53] lygerzr0: was he kneeling to you
[5:17:56] iBanEvader: maybe Blizzard should just disable details
[5:18:05] Dr0ddy: I firmly believe addons ruined world of warcraft
[5:18:07] adam_brisbane: it is known that bots would be less
[5:18:08] Thrively: no dps meters would suck
[5:18:13] blazzedzz: Retail will never get a new player base unless they stop designing the game around having all the add-ons
[5:18:19] Auratara: One thing about asmons opinion I find true is that addons essentially have triggered an arms race with the devs to come up with challenging stuff for people that have the addons, and eventually you raise the floor of the skill cap
[5:18:28] realandtruephobe: The robe and daggers look is pretty good ngl
[5:18:31] Jumballaya: players are still bad with addons and the guides
[5:18:33] snayrofficial: i still only ever see Xar - ass - in - two when i look at your name ingame lolllll
[5:18:33] badash321: addons are hard too for players to get into the game, trying to explain them is insane for someone who just wants to play
[5:18:34] Shawk_23: Assassin with throwing knives? or too far?
[5:18:34] g0dzilla: @Thrively some pros it would have
[5:18:35] Auratara: Leaving many players behind
[5:18:37] Nilese: the skill cap becomes way higher
[5:18:39] joejoejosephhh: pvp with no addons
[5:18:46] holynorthcb: ?? the achievement requires you to kill him
[5:18:50] baldanduseless: would you do these type runs if you werent a streamer?  @Xaryu
[5:18:51] ChildishNA: true but being elitist shouldn't be the base player
[5:18:51] xiClutchBoyix: the cow?!
[5:18:51] Draaxx: So ban addons, twitch streamers, and guides Kappa
[5:18:54] sketchie711: RIP COW
[5:18:54] sunny_lik: why ????? stop killing caw
[5:18:57] roskiyeta: poor cow :(
[5:19:00] sunny_lik: cow
[5:19:01] sketchie711: ALWAYS REMMEBER
[5:19:01] mo32167: why did u kill the cow tho
[5:19:05] adam_brisbane: removing addons and logs helps protect the players form bots easy sale
[5:19:07] diegombraga97: bruh? Why killed the inocent cow?
[5:19:08] sketchie711: ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COW
[5:19:08] zarillon1: amazon is bis
[5:19:08] alexbilbaoo: what did the cow do
[5:19:11] cronetym1409: The game is funner when not everybody is doing the same thing for the same reason
[5:19:13] Mahca_: imo a game almost requiring addons is bad for new players. most stuff should be available in base game
[5:19:15] Lekar624: character activity is being monitored?
[5:19:18] normageqq: the skillgap would widen
[5:19:20] Valencia_Pete: i couldn't imagine being a healer and decursing without addons
[5:19:20] TokerTy420: you need a lot of addons for retail?? sry I don’t play retail
[5:19:22] sketchie711: RIP COW! GOOD OL BESSY
[5:19:22] bigtimerush_1989: what does the fox say
[5:19:23] sunny_lik: azamousSwiper azamousTakemoneymad
[5:19:24] illyiochess: addons that dont help the players in terms of skill in raids or pvp would make the game better but keep the simple ones
[5:19:36] laptopgamerx: bro what does this have to do with mama and papa and amazon
[5:19:36] ggbr0sky: yes
[5:19:37] theDRG: We are in a world of optimization and convenience. Its the way the world is now.
[5:19:37] Pokket_Gaming: Are you going to group up for Redridge quests or are you just going to skip them?
[5:19:39] Dr0ddy: IMO the issue is with addons that provide additional combat info that you would not otherwise receive.
[5:19:41] B4ttlemedic: YES
[5:19:43] ScryerTV: same irl..iphone etc
[5:19:43] voidtouched_93: ozy was playing hc without a map no questie last night, thought it was really cool
[5:19:46] TikiTopper: Blizz is a for profit company...they arent going to take away addons and make it harder for the average player. Blizz makes their money from people that login and play a few hours a week....not the folks putting in 20 hours a week
[5:19:46] FlynnFluff: look at Fortnite it was so fun when it first came out and people were really bad and then once the build meta and people started doing adderal and building fortresses the game became crap and lost a lot of player base @xaryu it’s a similar concept to adding addons in wow
[5:19:46] slicewoody: Chickens :D
[5:19:47] Catalystic_Sudo: what do you use for auto run?
[5:19:49] Redhairpirate13: do you play with adding in tournaments?
[5:19:49] xiClutchBoyix: i low key wouldnt play wow without a damage meter lol could do without logs tho
[5:19:50] Cowmance: @Xaryu blizzard should release a version of WoW where no addon could be used at all
[5:19:52] direwolf575: it’s like having iPhones now compared to flip phones 20 years ago
[5:19:54] erebus_xrtc: it would be good if blizzard used those popular addon in game
[5:19:59] diegombraga97: If the game had good and visual ways to have a good performance, we wont need weak aura...
[5:20:00] VdoTapes: what color is the dress gold or blue
[5:20:00] AxelFromAustralia: put recount into the game and remove all combat addons weakauras dbm ect
[5:20:03] hart_mk1: the bigger problem imo is blizzard leaning into designing around addons more and more
[5:20:03] SghettiBoy: Idk i think people might glamorize addonless gameplay
[5:20:07] cxn_r: Blizzard know that if they remove addons the game will have much less player base
[5:20:14] Saiauriel: Can't go back, Bob
[5:20:16] ParfumAmerican: they should make camera focus even closer by default
[5:20:17] Mahca_: there’s some addons doing things that a human would not be able to do; unfair to new players without addons
[5:20:18] Lawpings: you can always navigate through those min-max strategies, for example i play a holy pally in SoD cuz it's considered the « worst » for the challenge of it
[5:20:18] shalomski: Ppl crying about addons thar have been part of this game for 20years 🤦
[5:20:19] realandtruephobe: yes. down with the globalist order!
[5:20:21] ipntheshower: "The monkey's out of the bottle, man. Pandora doesn't go back in the box, he only comes out." James Franco Pineapple Express 2008
[5:20:22] g0dzilla: @Cowmance agree... but alot is just qol and is needed... like questie for example...
[5:20:22] GamingWithPaulito: @FlynnFluff Fortnite is one of the biggest games on the planet lol. You left. It didnt leave you
[5:20:24] TakyonTriple654rkedTongue: it exists, deal with it
[5:20:27] baldanduseless: would you do these types of runs if you werent a streamer? @Xaryu
[5:20:30] Krim707: if they removed the combat log nobody would care. the gameplay still stands out and above the data
[5:20:32] kriethos: @cxn_r wouldnt say much, def not in the long run
[5:20:32] Vilend34: @xaryu it is better that way on a personal level, but the community as a whole would die. I prefer to play addon free, but that is not accepted by everyone.
[5:20:33] hitmon_gg: we have to go back kate

[5:22:42] Draaxx: Oh man the scripts people use to use in tournaments though were insane

[5:28:09] kriethos: how do u get the elite sign on u portrait? @Xaryu
[5:28:19] realandtruephobe: Bro watch out for the Defias pillagers they killed my hunter last night
[5:28:19] Auratara: But when are we at a point where they can comfortably ban addons without it affecting the QoL addons. I personally just think combat addons are poison
[5:28:20] ryuzakilightyagami: Bagon
[5:28:25] hot6auce: WeakAuras OP
[5:28:25] Chef_Nick: weakauras
[5:28:31] cookie_jayy: I agree with you 100%%%
[5:28:31] mcflewaway2: did you die ?
[5:28:32] ashraf_ma: Weakauras are insane in retail
[5:28:33] hart_mk1: again, the biggest problem that blizz ignores and in fact exacerbates is things like weakauras and dbm and the like @Xaryu
[5:28:40] cookie_jayy: then you dont use your brain LUL
[5:28:41] TheseDaysLIVE: Its a literal cheat yea
[5:28:45] Catalystic_Sudo: @kriethos leatrix plus
[5:28:46] fuchai: gladius tracks alot of things as well though
[5:28:56] kriethos: @Catalystic_Sudo thank you
[5:28:57] HopeyGMoney: @Xaryu what is the add-on you use to see your target's target?
[5:28:59] MarkoIRL: do u like tatoos
[5:29:00] ThrokkTheWarrior: like DBM
[5:29:03] Jixson_: are you gonna make a guild discord for sf hardcore?
[5:29:05] tuna_sandw1ch: is this double XP???
[5:29:13] Korvynah: Or the addon that shows FC names in warsong from one flag room to the next through walls in big lettering
[5:29:15] Korvynah: essentially ESP
[5:29:20] GallowayOW: people will have DBM and still not do anything
[5:29:20] Draaxx: Yeah, but think of accessibility
[5:29:21] Atalos1126: gladius tracks a lot of things that the game SHOULD be tracking
[5:29:22] realandtruephobe: @HopeyGMoney It's in settings not an addon
[5:29:34] Atalos1126: like diminishing returns
[5:29:35] guccikikuchi: does classic have a bigger player base than retail ATM?
[5:29:36] Vilend34: how many pro players would not be at that level without addons I wonder. they aren’t actually that much better, they just have a better program.
[5:29:38] kyletalkss: Hard agree w/ you
[5:29:38] Aka_Gami: I think Asmon is right that a "No addon" server would be hella fun
[5:29:38] skytzi: just play with no addons. and also mouse-click everything
[5:29:39] ashraf_ma: To be fair , it's impossible to track some things otherwise and weakauras can be a necessary evil @Xaryu
[5:29:41] Zolshy89: WAs are amazing
[5:29:41] Catalystic_Sudo: @hopeygmoney I wondering this myself
[5:29:44] HopeyGMoney: @realandtruephobe thank you!
[5:29:44] twiggyyyyyy: But if everyone can use them,  isnt ok?
[5:29:45] timha97: !ASSASSIN
[5:29:45] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:29:48] Auratara: Combat is the line for me.
[5:29:50] deeman_3: what is gladius?
[5:29:51] keredj: I agree with the wa thing never liked them in pvp
[5:29:53] KairuruTV: no
[5:29:54] JukezZA: i dont think they past that, just wipe harmful addons that make you play the game in a way thats not intended and say thats how it is now. if you dont like it dont play it
[5:29:54] IamHeisensperg: the thing people are even mad about is an in game retail macro
[5:29:55] theDRG: I find myself only checking basic positioning from my player character in relation to the enemies/etc. The rest of my time is spent looking at weakauras and bars and UI elements. Idk whats even happening in the fight, just know what to do.
[5:29:57] kirk_hunts: like the bis raid leader addon Vocal Raid Assistant. I use it to lead my guild raids and it's so overpowered.
[5:29:57] derpyllama420: nah
[5:29:58] Roflmaister: who runs blizzard?
[5:30:00] ashraf_ma: No shot
[5:30:03] gunzpewpew: @ashraf_ma The question is if you're suposed to be able to track everything. Why not cap the maximization
[5:30:05] Crwxxx: @Vilend34 thats a stretch, but ye it probably would look different
[5:30:08] ashraf_ma: All the funding is in retail for a reason
[5:30:10] Jixson_: SF hardcore guild discord??
[5:30:11] Spart7nz: who do you think best class gonna be in phase 3?
[5:30:13] TheSHAYdynasty: maybe not right now, retail near the end of a tier
[5:30:19] Mahca_: addons are not new player friendly imo that stuff should be accessible in game if intended
[5:30:22] ChakProspero: Is this Classic?
[5:30:29] justskeeting11: how to move while casting using mouse???
[5:30:38] Caledvwych: lolwut?
[5:30:41] KairuruTV: nah
[5:30:41] InnsaiyanTV: more 100%
[5:30:43] StunningPaul: @Xaryu make a guild tabard
[5:30:45] Wallscast: more than retail cause retail is stale patch rnb
[5:30:49] KairuruTV: classic has way les, not even close
[5:30:49] reallyeric: yeah id say its pretty 50/50
[5:30:55] KosmicDevil_: i think its about 50 50 yeah
[5:30:59] MsVivienne: srsly? so many ppl playing retail?
[5:31:04] merixeniz94: is it possible to play solo on retail and have fun?
[5:31:06] ARROOCE: people underestimate how many casuals play retail
[5:31:07] infraredpen: people underestimate how many people play retail, even in its slow moments
[5:31:09] rn_bomber: I have read reports saying retail pulls a lot more numbers.
[5:31:10] realandtruephobe: Yo the pillagers killed me last night. Watch out for those fools
[5:31:13] cookie_jayy: @justskeeting11 press buttons with your KB?
[5:31:14] Roflmaister: i cannot play this game with controller
[5:31:16] nocontrast: the casuals are quiet
[5:31:18] WalkingLT: retail is an action mmorpg
[5:31:18] Nappycans: i just downloaded Wrath. found a bunch of my chars from along time ago. There was one person in undercity. That one person was me... :(
[5:31:20] nocontrast: hard to know
[5:31:21] Googen: classic is more popular on twitch
[5:31:21] baldanduseless: i say 60-40 cause sod is popping
[5:31:22] ashraf_ma: Classic has way less , twitch is a classic bubble because it's more watchable @Xaryu
[5:31:23] kriethos: i think its more like 35 to 65 for retail
[5:31:23] DanRas08: Whats the name of your rune swapping weak aura?
[5:31:31] 808_B0ris: why doesnt SF have a own Server ?
[5:31:39] jstuwie: @Nappycans PoroSad PoroSad
[5:31:51] Mahca_: based on blizzcon attendance retail has more players for sure
[5:31:51] ddraggbagg: @Xaryu any reason you went sub instead of the "assassination" tree?
[5:31:52] Pudlik: i mean alot of people from retail play classic when not raiding, so it isnt like a full split. if you like wow you like wow.
[5:31:55] kazo57: xar when are you playing supermarket simulator?
[5:31:55] LurkenTheBurken: !sf
[5:31:59] StunningPaul: Will you eventually be doing MC?
[5:32:03] valeriuz: what's the name of the bag addon you're using mate?
[5:32:03] largist_: around 40-60 with more on retail would be my guess
[5:32:09] tomfare: @Xaryu Yo, big fan here with an uncomfortable question if u dont mind. But I've always noticed at the end of every other sentence you "smack your lips". I have this audio-phobia (it's a real thing) for this sound which bothers me bcause I otherwise love listening to you. I know it's a big thing to ask for you to change it, but I was wondering if you are aware of it Josh <3 sending love and don't take this as criticism
[5:32:11] Crwxxx: the problem with addons is that blizzard add things in pvp/pve to make it harder without addons. when we raided in classic (20 years ago omg...) the raids were "hard". but now they look easy cause everyone uses addon, we didnt have that back in classic
[5:32:12] iPlayCuzFun: "According to the latest esports guides' estimates, there are roughly 129 million active players in World of Warcraft."
[5:32:13] YuraruY: lmao a 40 spriest tried to gank me and i killed him (im a 30 rogue)
[5:32:15] Zolshy89: look at M+ numbers
[5:32:19] Zolshy89: you can see how many ppl play
[5:32:27] Jixson_: are you gonna make a discord for Solo?
[5:32:28] Dr0ddy: Average viewer can't look at a retail screen and know what is going on.
[5:32:32] Zolshy89: more ppl play M+ than anything
[5:32:35] kirk_hunts: New world record Gnomer 16:47
[5:32:38] ChakProspero: @tomfare LOL
[5:32:39] valeriuz: what's the name of the bag addon you're using mate? @Xaryu
[5:32:41] grkgemini94: SSF HC is kind of a redundant game mode because the players who care about SSF already been SSF..... hence the lack of hype
[5:32:42] Perdonamo: i cant tell whats on the screen in retail
[5:32:43] definitelynotbaku: thats because of the streamers tho not the game itself
[5:32:46] ooogabooga128: no one plays retail
[5:32:47] tomfare: @ChakProspero I'm serious
[5:32:47] Wallscast: retail M+ is dead rn season basically over
[5:32:59] ggbr0sky: THATS WHY ITS DEAD
[5:32:59] ryuzakilightyagami: Well exactly
[5:32:59] reallyeric: thats any current MMO tho no?
[5:32:59] Perkasetz: not like i have any idea what happens in league
[5:33:00] Roflmaister: true, only base game is relevant
[5:33:01] Trainingtobeperson: get rid of addons and the UI will be more clear
[5:33:02] Perkasetz: and thats popular
[5:33:05] tomfare: @Xaryu Yo, big fan here with an uncomfortable question if u dont mind. But I've always noticed at the end of every other sentence you "smack your lips". I have this audio-phobia (it's a real thing) for this sound which bothers me bcause I otherwise love listening to you. I know it's a big thing to ask for you to change it, but I was wondering if you are aware of it Josh <3 sending love and don't take this as criticism
[5:33:06] yexpensive: !assassin
[5:33:06] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:33:06] hart_mk1: blizzard chasing the esport thing in an mmo is absolutely insane to me
[5:33:08] crapcore: how is SSF .. SSF when u can group and get carried
[5:33:11] plae007: fastest ive done it is 31 mins lolol
[5:33:14] Jixson_: Solo guild discord?
[5:33:15] arrico_suave: race to world first is pretty hype when its happening
[5:33:15] infraredpen: every streamer has their own spaceship UI you gotta disect before you can actually watch
[5:33:15] Shawk_23: yeah if you google it it looks like retail has a lot more daily players, but classic players are just chads
[5:33:26] ARROOCE: @Wallscast go to lfg rn and tell me its dead, you can scroll endless LULW
[5:33:28] valeriuz: what's the name of the bag addon you're using mate?
[5:33:29] rn_bomber: @crapcore it’s SF not SSF
[5:33:36] theDRG: My best gnomer is 24mins with +2min coming from missing 2 adds
[5:33:38] kriethos: how does it work with groups in ssf?
[5:33:39] Landotazo: spaceship UI lol
[5:33:42] Zolshy89: thats an FPS
[5:33:45] Zolshy89: not an MMO
[5:33:57] Zolshy89: entirely different problem
[5:33:57] kyletalkss: went for 2.1k+ for arena this season and the amount of addons you have to have to be aware to perform is crazy
[5:33:58] taylorsdank: @tomfare sorry homie maybe download a closed captions addon
[5:33:58] 666dammit: true
[5:34:00] frozenpizza2209: Wish they did a fresh vanilla without any addons
[5:34:01] baldanduseless: peoeple will be able to watch cata PogChamp
[5:34:02] ibetrippiin: over watch
[5:34:04] tuna_sandw1ch: dont have that with p0rn, you know what youre watching
[5:34:05] Wallscast: @ARROOCE i have im 2.5 k io+ 3 toons beat this season already
[5:34:06] Dr0ddy: Hence, get rid of addons
[5:34:08] Pokket_Gaming: Ya but are people watching WoW who don't actually play??
[5:34:08] Twitchswag2k15: mitchPls mitchWOW mitchPls
[5:34:09] CuppaCoffeh: I just wait for the addon to tell me to turn in the quest. unless I vender first and sell my quest items
[5:34:12] xmedpakx: with how many servers retail has it seems unlikely classic has numbers even comparable
[5:34:15] alexbilbaoo: The UI is not the problem
[5:34:16] Roflmaister: rogue base class skills make you legit
[5:34:17] KIILLINIT: and everything changes every month too
[5:34:20] kyletalkss: TRUE
[5:34:22] symca0: Have you tried buffs on frostfire bolt ??
[5:34:22] tomfare: @taylorsdank I love Xaryu's voice though
[5:34:26] Firesw0rd3: Most UIs people use are actually extremely similar, but you do need to get used to what you're looking at
[5:34:29] hart_mk1: they've homogenized the gameplay so much but allowed the UX to go completely and utterly mental, i don't understand how that's a good strategy
[5:34:36] Smoakezy: I think WA's are the biggest issue, not necessarily add ons
[5:34:38] ChakProspero: I would love to go back to Vanilla so I could play a Mace Rogue again.
[5:34:39] taylorsdank: @tomfare have you tried lookin up any fixes on your end? :P
[5:34:42] Quaras_: That's why it'd be better without custom UIs and Addons
[5:34:43] valeriuz: what's the name of the bag addon you're using?
[5:34:46] Mahca_: ui addons are fine, mechanical ones are bad for gameplay design
[5:34:47] mentolosliqvid: @xaryi u going to the next stv?
[5:34:50] tomfare: Guess I'll ask one more time (Sorry for the spam)  @taylorsdank
[5:34:50] Munchagramz: raiding also no slouch for addons with retail
[5:34:57] frozenpizza2209: No addons fresh vanilla would be awesome + some tbc arena with no addons :D
[5:34:58] tomfare: @taylorsdank well there is no therapy for it sadly
[5:35:00] TEEEEmac: its hard to watch you as a rogue. Keep thinking im going to be ganked
[5:35:00] leroyrobenson: Weak Auras is 12 addons in a trenchcoat.
[5:35:00] eskilda: Do you think you could get Rank 1 without any addons?
[5:35:04] teknison: weakauras is an addon creater
[5:35:05] kyletalkss: true x2
[5:35:06] JukezZA: gz!
[5:35:06] shalomski: @tomfare are you being serious ? Guess what ?noise is part of life, have to get used to it.
[5:35:07] realandtruephobe: @tomfare You really don't need to keep copy pasting this tbh
[5:35:08] JoaEUW: Weakauras are insanely cool imo
[5:35:11] alexbilbaoo: The issue is how players interacting with each other looks
[5:35:12] Roflmaister: even human have to be combat in modern
[5:35:13] Incin_gaming: i mean there are built in scripts that you can use through blizzard default macro system that is honestly worse than weak auras
[5:35:13] taylorsdank: @tomfare i dated a girl who had that so I believe ya, sorry man!
[5:35:13] 666dammit: Is it OK to play without addons>
[5:35:16] KairuruTV: the ISSUE is what API blizzard allows the addon makers to use
[5:35:17] tomfare: @Xaryu Yo, big fan here with an uncomfortable question if u dont mind. But I've always noticed at the end of every other sentence you "smack your lips". I have this audio-phobia (it's a real thing) for this sound which bothers me bcause I otherwise love listening to you. I know it's a big thing to ask for you to change it, but I was wondering if you are aware of it Josh <3 sending love and don't take this as criticism
[5:35:18] Roflmaister: lol
[5:35:19] Pudlik: the issue is blizzard base UI is trash.
[5:35:19] Crwxxx: Quality of life addons are ok, but when you are using addons to make it easier/get advantage thats wrong
[5:35:23] tomfare: @taylorsdank thanks man
[5:35:24] Jerichozq: If RIOT Games came out with an MMO like WoW, would you play it? @Xaryu
[5:35:27] grilledcheeseistasty: @Xaryu i sthere a mage harrdcore challenge?
[5:35:31] herrxr: Everything.
[5:35:32] Roflmaister: ally rogue humnan scum
[5:35:33] Quaras_: EVERYTHING
[5:35:34] baldanduseless: with out weakauras how would people spam bruh
[5:35:43] Dinomight3: @tomfare you are a psycho lmao
[5:35:43] Jumballaya: they should add some documentation, not remove stuff
[5:35:45] Dr0ddy: addtional combat info not in base game
[5:35:47] iKnowGunFu: remove automatic actions
[5:35:48] Kosmicpanther: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[5:35:48] Roflmaister: just roll human
[5:35:49] Kellvig: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[5:35:49] finde3315: gratz!

[5:35:54] megasen: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[5:35:55] vilness: @Xaryu The issue is blizzard UI is not good enough, dont see enough

[5:36:06] frozenpizza2209: No addons period
[5:36:06] erokk46: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[5:36:06] acestrickster: gz on rogue!
[5:36:07] kingmabis: less is more, every class has a heal, every class has some op movement
[5:36:14] Dinomight3: @tomfare strimmer change yourself so i can watch ur show
[5:36:14] DeathToad007: there are visual queues
[5:36:16] reallyeric: have you ever played with crusader? Xaryu
[5:36:16] ryuzakilightyagami: Bigdebuffs was nice along w gladius
[5:36:18] Roflmaister: just roll human rogue
[5:36:18] infraredpen: good tbh
[5:36:19] DeathToad007: and sound queues
[5:36:19] Zolshy89: Also they have already opened Pandoras gate,PPL would be pissed on retail
[5:36:20] Roflmaister: lol
[5:36:22] Crwxxx: remove api all together, i think people would be pissed at first - but you'd get used to it
[5:36:22] iPlayCuzFun: yes by looking and hearing animations
[5:36:24] Zolshy89: *box
[5:36:25] alexbilbaoo: The issue is how players interacting with each other looks 󠀀
[5:36:29] hart_mk1: remove everything and incorporate the most popular addons (which they've mostly done already) into the official client
[5:36:30] KIILLINIT: that would be fun, no addons
[5:36:33] Dr0ddy: Yeah those should all be obvious visual indicators
[5:36:34] jumbro: jumbro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! let's go!
[5:36:34] lw_baleeiro: thats the problem with that question. Or you remove complete (and wait for bliz implement some QOL in vanilla) or o allow complete
[5:36:36] Kellvig: @Xaryu already have your discord in the guild, under the rules
[5:36:40] ChaptinRedbeard: the only way to make it work is to take away everything, otherwise someone gets a advantage
[5:36:51] Roflmaister: there is no honor is you have none
[5:36:56] Rainey719: Even IF you remove addons from being allowed on WoW, people will still create and install addons, and not talk about it in game. That's currently how it is on FFXIV for example
[5:36:56] haukewood_: what would the state of pvp arena be without addons?
[5:37:00] Dinomight3: @tomfare you said "I know it's a big thing to ask for you to change it"
[5:37:13] grilledcheeseistasty: @Xaryu  WHAT HEALTHY PASTA SAUCE DO U U USE ? IS IT RAOS?
[5:37:16] rn_bomber: @tomfare he is not aware of talking normal and aware of a thing that bothers 1 person
[5:37:18] Zolshy89: yes
[5:37:20] realandtruephobe: @tomfare So you really need to know SO BAD if he's aware of his mouth sounds that you copy and paste this over and over?
[5:37:20] Zolshy89: install a wa
[5:37:23] KairuruTV: pointing out the player is pointless because we cant run peoples lives or thinking
[5:37:23] kingmabis: sod is more entertaining in my opinion to watch because its not overload and just people running all over the map, teleporting, disappearing
[5:37:23] savagekelr: yes
[5:37:25] Zolshy89: it takes no effort
[5:37:25] Dinomight3: @tomfare you're insane lol
[5:37:30] SghettiBoy: DONTA HATE THA PLAYA HATE THA GAME
[5:37:34] Dr0ddy: Just create no addon servers maybe?
[5:37:35] AngerManagmt: I'd love to see a SSF with no addons and no map
[5:37:36] ChakProspero: @tomfare Even if he was aware, why does it matter?
[5:37:36] taylorsdank: @Dinomight3 relax yall
[5:37:40] spergsy: What even is an issue, it's completely subjective.
[5:37:40] LimpsNoodles: min max = dopamine
[5:37:42] ryuzakilightyagami: Vendor addon xar
[5:37:42] grizz430: yes, you can blame someone for being a shitty toxic person
[5:37:43] graziNNN: @grilledcheeseistasty We don't use RAO's anymore since Campbell's bought em out
[5:37:47] tuna_sandw1ch: the real hardcore rogue challenge is gagball and gimp suit
[5:37:50] Ausden: !assassin
[5:37:50] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:37:51] kingmabis: would be cool if the had sod with all the retail colasses but less spells and normal spec trees
[5:37:56] KairuruTV: arguing peoples mentality is pointless, we arent running peoples lives
[5:38:02] kimdj: @tomfare why does it matter if hes aware though?
[5:38:03] jstuwie: stop talking about the danm smacking who cares!
[5:38:07] jstuwie: move on
[5:38:08] Roflmaister: min max is racist
[5:38:17] madabber_: players are becoming eliteists because inviting people who need to be fully taught the raid is annoying and time consuming when some people learned it week one. they just need to join a learning group they happen all the time on wild growth US
[5:38:17] GallowayOW: the majority of the player base dont know basic things about the game
[5:38:20] lw_baleeiro: : thats the problem with that question. Or you remove complete (and wait for bliz implement some QOL in vanilla) or o allow complete
[5:38:20] ryuzakilightyagami: Broken can save gold
[5:38:22] bag_jones_: excuse me who are you?
[5:38:23] WaterBoxx: @Xaryu why is it so HARD to get into a Gnomer group, any recommendations? I feel like dropping this game
[5:38:26] ryuzakilightyagami: Lmao
[5:38:27] 666dammit: i just dont know anything about addons, so no addons:)))) easy
[5:38:31] hart_mk1: wanting to be competitive isn't toxic, having a developer design increasingly around user-made addons is toxic
[5:38:31] waslikeWTF: ever thought of trying OSRS?
[5:38:47] houstontx281: impossible
[5:38:49] doctor4ir: sup
[5:38:52] artlinked: artlinked subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:38:56] Dash4cash723: Not as a rogue
[5:38:57] ggbr0sky: depend on class
[5:38:57] tyresemicah: Not for warriors
[5:38:58] ibetrippiin: yeah its true
[5:38:58] stevierob98: your ass still in two xar?
[5:38:58] KairuruTV: ive never had an issue, and i play rogue
[5:38:59] ChakProspero: I may have to reinstall the game.  This makes me realize how much I've missed it.
[5:38:59] mcfunkyjunky: hey chat and @Xaryu what are the server for HC SSC EU?
[5:39:01] baldanduseless: its hard for grey parsing andys
[5:39:01] graziNNN: Don't join a group, make your own - problem solved
[5:39:01] Daracus98: i always get insta invited (im a lock tank)
[5:39:01] spergsy: just find a random warcraftlogs char and lie that they are your mains logs
[5:39:02] WaterBoxx: Not as mage
[5:39:06] Towenaar2: 6/6 CHECKING LOGS
[5:39:08] Ajmadgamer: depends on your class
[5:39:08] Munchagramz: Who wants to tell them... they are just bad
[5:39:09] Rainey719: Gnomer is hard if you haven't raided it yet or are certain classes
[5:39:10] kriethos: just start making u own group, goes much faster for me
[5:39:12] Firesw0rd3: I think, many people, like most here I imagine, have played this game for 10+ years, and we forget how complex it actually is.
[5:39:13] Mico027: Im in guilds so I dont have that issue
[5:39:14] WaterBoxx: 6/6 CHECKING LOGS
[5:39:18] Mr_NeonCloud: I found a gnomer group 2 hours after i dinged on my mage
[5:39:21] Kirnc: yea i bear tank and have people whispeeing for me to join
[5:39:23] KairuruTV: just make your own or join a casual guild
[5:39:23] DrAEDB: i mean with a game as complicated as retail now a days why not make it easier with addons. The difference between classic and retail
[5:39:31] uhzyncz: !assassin
[5:39:31] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:39:32] realandtruephobe: lol not my experience
[5:39:33] largist_: It is little more rough if u happened to roll a rouge
[5:39:36] BPD_Catgirl: @spergsy holy 5Head
[5:39:43] YuraruY: horde are so petty, i got two 40 hordes camping me (30 rogue) bc i killed 1 of them on a 1v1 and they got butthurt
[5:39:43] alexbilbaoo: My bad,i meant the issue is how Characters model interacts with others
[5:39:43] HalfDollar: I quit WOTLK because of gear score
[5:39:48] Griff_666: Depends on class id say
[5:39:49] uhzyncz: What happened to Xarssassin 1?
[5:39:50] Spart7nz: best tip for counting caloires?
[5:39:51] MonkeyOverlord: Don't even have to top parse, 99s don't mind running with blue and purple parses.
[5:39:51] DashKT: @largist_ Rogue*
[5:39:54] Zolshy89: there is nothing wrong with that
[5:39:56] tommygunz31: that’s why I joined a dad guild
[5:39:58] Rokosor: In my experience, but top parsing is NOT necessary at all
[5:39:59] houstontx281: Haven't been able to find a group since i dinged 40 as a rogue
[5:40:00] baldanduseless: all the classic andys cant handle mechanics and being left in the dust
[5:40:01] Zolshy89: there are different kinds of players
[5:40:02] KairuruTV: 100%
[5:40:02] Kistler: 100p
[5:40:03] Jaysmoke: ngl im not a top parser, i normally parse shit. but im always top dps so fuck it
[5:40:07] Lawpings: omfg 100%
[5:40:08] Chef_Nick: the irony is if "everyone" became a 99 parser 99's would become 50 parses
[5:40:08] slapshotsd: emphasis on parsing in sod is just lame because the content is sooooo easy
[5:40:08] Viisionz74: 80% True
[5:40:12] CptBananaBits: completely
[5:40:13] KairuruTV: not even close
[5:40:14] ARROOCE: depends on difficulty, you can raid normal with one hand
[5:40:14] bamfosaurus: not if you are a rogue, nobody wants rogues Sadge
[5:40:15] Rokosor: as long as your parses are not gray, groups are easy to find
[5:40:18] DrAEDB: retail takes almsot no effort to get into a group
[5:40:21] Knaxxis: way easier to find a group for heroic and normal if u have the gear score
[5:40:21] alexbilbaoo: +1
[5:40:22] Lawpings: Retail is kind of toxic in his state right now
[5:40:22] Roflmaister: 100% trasg
[5:40:23] elysium_cy: thats retail right?
[5:40:25] Wallscast: NOBODY checks parses for retail heroic lol
[5:40:26] hart_mk1: @DrAEDB it's complicated because of the addons, if blizzard wouldn't design around intrusive addons then the game would be much more user-friendly
[5:40:28] TURBO_EXTREME: I mean even from ziqo's vid, knowing you could have a raid take 3 hours without "gatekeeping" or one hour just by checking people for playing like you do.
[5:40:28] PixSamael: whats more casual than lfr like what
[5:40:29] Munchagramz: yeah retal is really gatekeepy
[5:40:30] bletso: you should see the requirements to get into Gnomer LUL
[5:40:30] Roflmaister: %100 trash
[5:40:34] largist_: @DashKT Rouges will be rouging :p
[5:40:35] hot6auce: you see the Ziqo video about him trying to get a Gnomer group @Xaryu ?
[5:40:35] JoaEUW: @Xaryu It's funny cause in SoM and classic before people were actually insanely sweaty. I wonder whats the more casual take to it now is. Or maybe it changes at 60
[5:40:36] teejway__: retail i can literally LFR
[5:40:38] shadwarform: Xar i just got my first extra 20 buttom mousse. After playing for 20 years, it feels so weird and hard to get used to
[5:40:39] Roflmaister: money crab
[5:40:39] xmedpakx: finding groups in retail is free though, the finder is OP
[5:40:42] KIILLINIT: the raids are easier but the the people what a credit score in SoD
[5:40:43] realrednalooz: It's WoW, its always gonna be sweaty
[5:40:47] Copertone: people care way more about parses in SoD lol. at least in LFG
[5:40:48] GunnarDotA2: you a fan of sweating in WoW?
[5:40:49] HalfDollar: In WOTLK you wouldn't get ever get invited to a group unless you had raid gear already, but you couldn't get that gear unless you get an invite
[5:40:52] Whole_Cake_Island: @tomfare can u pm me
[5:40:52] DiaDonnie: what is that green buff you got? @Xaryu
[5:40:55] alexbilbaoo: Who plays "classic" for the pve?
[5:41:03] Kirnc: join a guild
[5:41:04] Spart7nz: any advice for counting calories for fat loss?
[5:41:11] Loutendo: Sweaty pve
[5:41:12] Zolshy89: I mean
[5:41:13] Roflmaister: 20 years of money crab
[5:41:14] DrAEDB: @hart_mk1  negative, look that 43 mofifiers you need to keep track of to make sure ur frostbolt hits harder than 13k
[5:41:14] criissts: Wjat do you think about warlock in pvp Xar
[5:41:14] iKnowGunFu: Find a good guild people. I'm in a dad guild that is super chill.
[5:41:15] Zolshy89: the meta of gaming
[5:41:15] Daracus98: time traveller
[5:41:18] Zolshy89: was just different
[5:41:19] WaterBoxx: @Xaryu I've been trying for 2 hrs - can't get into a group and I've ran Gnomer multiple times
[5:41:20] chadworld77: me. i play for pve
[5:41:23] Weemancod: was there parsing back in the day?
[5:41:24] realandtruephobe: I'm just not a god gamer, I'm having fun with WoW, but trying to get a gnomer or group and having to sell my skills 24/7 is lame imo
[5:41:24] kenxxys: @alexbilbaoo literally everyone, its what the game was made for
[5:41:24] hairfair88: Kungen stopped streaming?
[5:41:25] KairuruTV: PvP has ALWAYS been a NICHE playstyle
[5:41:25] chadworld77: pvp is a means to an end usually
[5:41:27] Moriz69: mmorpg is 90% pve
[5:41:31] lazerlivetv: Hope your havin a good day at the office Xar
[5:41:31] elysium_cy: my main is retail since 2004
[5:41:34] Vilend34: was much more fun when everyone was noobs imo
[5:41:34] Mahca_: it’s fine for people to try hard but dev shouldn’t make the game around those people
[5:41:35] KatinaEatsKilos: I play for PvE as wel
[5:41:35] JukezZA: i havent even done a raid yet KEKW i just pvp
[5:41:36] Korvynah: PVP IS ENDGAME
[5:41:37] Auratara: I play classic for the questing
[5:41:38] spergsy: kungen was always chewing, prove me wrong
[5:41:38] elysium_cy: Priest Holy
[5:41:39] kriethos: @Weemancod u had logs at some point
[5:41:39] slicewoody: @Xaryu I play pve for the drops
[5:41:41] Roflmaister: china made more money than blizz
[5:41:42] teejway__: retail is 100% easier with LFR. there is no LFR here so people are bringing the mythic mentality to sod raids. which is pretty dumb.
[5:41:43] ChaoticTrack: Should Blizz have locked down UI customization from the start? I wonder where the balance is between letting ppl add QOL improvements vs. add-ons that make the game unrecognizeable
[5:41:44] Aka_Gami: I enjoy SF HC because every run is its own experience
[5:41:45] kirk_hunts: I only pve because I have to to get gear to pvp in classic
[5:41:46] Vugaddii: My only issue with classic is no arena. I play for pvp, and the pvp is very limited
[5:41:51] slapshotsd: @Mahca_ i don't think they are in sod, the content is super easy you don't have to be good for it
[5:41:51] elysium_cy: all expansions
[5:41:54] spergsy: food
[5:41:54] Arendiel_: HUH
[5:41:55] JukezZA: deez nutz
[5:41:57] ilikeryan: Xaryu can i have ur Weak aura for Fingers of frost
[5:41:58] hart_mk1: @DrAEDB you're missing the point, that exists because of the addons that have grown increasingly intrusive over the years and trivialized the gameplay historically
[5:42:00] Alakfron: pvp is secondary to pve in p2
[5:42:01] Lawpings: lfr is a joke
[5:42:02] Jumballaya: it feels like most people are gatekeeping way past their own abilities
[5:42:03] elysium_cy: nah
[5:42:04] kimdj: what
[5:42:04] Firesw0rd3: LFR is not raiding
[5:42:06] Chrigss: lfr doesn't feel rewarding
[5:42:06] Daracus98: lfr aint raiding
[5:42:12] alexbilbaoo: To tryhard? PvP 100%. Pve tryhard is doing SpeedRuns,like kekw
[5:42:13] Munchagramz: no but raidingh past heroic is tough cause unless you have AOTC you get ignored
[5:42:16] Viisionz74: Bro even LFR is harder than gnomer
[5:42:17] LeithersKedge: you can AFK thru LFR
[5:42:18] parabellum2213: lfr isnt real raiding...
[5:42:20] normageqq: lfr is just the classic experience
[5:42:22] RockstarPunched: how long will u be streaming today?
[5:42:24] kenxxys: you guys are comparing completely different games lol
[5:42:26] KIILLINIT: Retail is easier to get a group, but the SoD raids are easier
[5:42:27] CuppaCoffeh: They should have retail hardcore
[5:42:29] teejway__: but for a casual player who doesnt care and just wants to do the content
[5:42:34] Viisionz74: This man never done LFR and spent 50 mins in the LFR because pugs
[5:42:35] elysium_cy: i have full classic  proffessions :)
[5:42:41] KnoxxGaming: lfr is not even worth the headache
[5:42:42] realandtruephobe: Nobody remind him about STV in 15...
[5:42:46] kirk_hunts: Electrocutioner is harder than lfr
[5:42:51] taylorsdank: LFR is for players who never intend on mythic raiding
[5:42:58] Mahca_: lfr is not m+
[5:43:07] eike8989: does anyone know for what are the epic head    " radiant ray reflecotrs"?
[5:43:16] Dr0ddy: You don't need special conditions for your abilities to do damage
[5:43:20] baldanduseless: not in sod Kappa
[5:43:26] kumbajastero: When i 1 tap 5 guys at 60 with bonereavers
[5:43:27] shadwarform: I wish there would be a gnomer LFR, cause no1 invites my 2h enchanc sham
[5:43:28] Mckenziehehe: pro ice lance hits big in retail now
[5:43:29] kkubby: PASSIVE BORING
[5:43:30] elysium_cy: Hand of  Adal  title
[5:43:32] baldanduseless: he means living flame guys
[5:43:37] Munchagramz: yeah pvp is very 1 shotie
[5:43:45] Roflmaister: just rolll vanilla
[5:43:45] kkubby: SO PASSIVE NEVER WANT TO PLAY AGAIN
[5:43:45] bilalvainqueur: game is too bloated
[5:43:46] stillballlin: preach
[5:43:47] DeathToad007: feeling powerful
[5:43:53] Dr0ddy: What a concept
[5:43:54] slapshotsd: @Munchagramz yeah if anything sod specifically is too far in the other direction
[5:43:56] Unfragged: 1  shot > dampening
[5:43:58] Knaxxis: i feel the dmg i do to ppl in retail as outlaw rogue so idk what u mean
[5:43:59] hart_mk1: because there are 500 different modifiers per spec and class that are a result of blizz designing around intrusive addons
[5:43:59] stillballlin: hitting hard feels good
[5:44:00] Mahca_: @eike8989 cosmetic item
[5:44:01] kriethos: RESIST KEKW
[5:44:07] Knaxxis: if they use a defensive i wont do as much dmg tho
[5:44:08] teribad: dh ain’t like that
[5:44:15] ipetam: thats why MOP PVP was last peak retail pvp
[5:44:19] Atruis_: Yeah classic feels better. You feel your character getting strong too. Mobs scale to your lvl in retail too so that kinda feels bad.
[5:44:22] Desolate_e36: not when you play dh
[5:44:24] UltrawideGameGuy: Classic pvp is just simpler
[5:44:25] soyboywolk: you actually have to have gear.. basically
[5:44:26] JoaEUW: I remember some eras of retail where a spec could absolutely one shot
[5:44:26] xdFather: What's that bag addon
[5:44:35] Knaxxis: its because in clasic, ppl dont hav ways to counter certain things
[5:44:36] jackcousteau: cloth chest hype
[5:44:39] xdFather: Ty!
[5:44:40] Emarcelopv: zygor or questie bro?
[5:44:41] Knaxxis: so they take dmg
[5:44:42] baldanduseless: we will be so spoiled with sod 60 and cata @Xaryu
[5:44:44] hot6auce: have you tried being Trill in retail? i heard thats the best way to do damage
[5:44:45] ashraf_ma: @Xaryu But that's arena , they have a pocket healer , in sod wpvp there's no pocket healer
[5:44:50] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[5:44:55] bpwryl: In retail the health bar is no longer an indication of how close someone is to dying cause it can go back to 100% immediately depending on coldowns
[5:44:56] honeykush: have you played this season? because that isnt the case rn on retail
[5:45:06] Moerdarlaxen: xaryu did u ever play with whazz?
[5:45:06] Knaxxis: in a duel i def feel the dmg in retail
[5:45:08] elysium_cy: i started playin and kept playin   because  of a  coma i  went in
[5:45:08] Munchagramz: wrld pvp
[5:45:09] siggysudzz: my guy are you wearing a dress
[5:45:15] WaterBoxx: @Xaryu been trying to get in a group for Gnomer for 2 hours, nothing, and I'm not bad lol... strange game
[5:45:26] Roflmaister: this content is olden than new world drunks
[5:45:27] PriceMaker: @WaterBoxx what class?
[5:45:34] ipetam: damn straight
[5:45:38] ipetam: u read my comment
[5:45:38] WaterBoxx: @PriceMaker Mage
[5:45:43] Knaxxis: ur wrong on this brother and i love you
[5:45:44] realandtruephobe: @WaterBoxx I'm with ya man. Tried for 90 mins last night, didn't even get invite. I haven't cleared yet btw so no one wants me
[5:45:45] Roflmaister: older*
[5:45:46] alexbilbaoo: Cata started it
[5:45:47] peasant_mindset: i think resil was the start of the downfall
[5:45:48] Vugaddii: CLASSIC MOP HYPE- MY LIFE WILL BE COMPLETE
[5:45:50] vanish_shs: !ASSASSIN
[5:45:51] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:45:51] peasant_mindset: of pvp
[5:45:52] zacharyzorbas: join a guild if you can't get pugs
[5:45:53] dizzypeezy: prob a warrior
[5:45:53] juice42069: its impossible to get in a group as a warr without logs
[5:45:55] WaterBoxx: @Xaryu I'm Mage Fire
[5:45:57] MrStLouis68: mage also can't get a group today
[5:45:59] ashraf_ma: Damage is insane in retail right now
[5:45:59] graziNNN: just make your own gnomer group
[5:46:01] deeman_3: Xar have you seen Ashes of Creation?
[5:46:04] Munchagramz: gd wod my shamen had a 1 mill elemental blast it merc'd
[5:46:06] TEEEEmac: hes not wrong
[5:46:07] slapshotsd: @realandtruephobe out of genuine curiosity have you tried lying about it?
[5:46:10] Dr0ddy: MoP goated
[5:46:12] DrAEDB: yeahhhh go to retail and see TTK rn lmao
[5:46:27] TEEEEmac: facts
[5:46:27] ipetam: ipetam subscribed with Prime. 
[5:46:28] Knaxxis: I mean im playing retail rn and i can feel the dmg for sure - see what u mean but its pretty bursty rn
[5:46:29] Roflmaister: ally fools, you are bias all the way
[5:46:31] sengip: facts
[5:46:32] hutchyy917: bro talking to a r1 about pvp lmao
[5:46:33] zen_oni_shinobi: well yeah and it's true.
[5:46:37] theDRG: Play DH they take all the damage :)
[5:46:37] asloff: hunters malding right now
[5:46:38] iLtDan: completely true
[5:46:40] saveslol: it depends on the class for this take, honestly.
[5:46:40] realandtruephobe: @slapshotsd I don't really want to because people ask which char you passed it on and look up logs
[5:46:40] ryuzakilightyagami: Yeah the guild elitists better not be gatekeeping gnomer for pugs surely
[5:46:41] inhaledthc: yep retail sucks :D
[5:46:42] MonkeyOverlord: I puged all of phase 1, joined an average guild with green parses and have had no issue clearing gnome after the first week struggling
[5:46:45] gunzpewpew: I feel like older instances of wow pvp is more chess like in the gameplay, which I like. Now it's just ZPEEEED
[5:46:47] Mckenziehehe: I mean there's plenty of one shots right now
[5:46:51] Vondem: What do you mean, in PvP?
[5:46:51] zen_oni_shinobi: everyone for years took warcraft and world of warcraft and wanted to be a god-king
[5:46:53] Daracus98: u have to line all ur offensive cds to even make the other guy trade a deffensive
[5:46:53] bonanzabrandon: Watch competitive arenas and see all of the stuff happening and no one dying LUL
[5:46:54] TEEEEmac: everyonje has self healing and shields
[5:46:55] Munchagramz: yeah watch pvp tornements peopls heal;thbars go down in 1 or 2 ticks
[5:46:56] JoaEUW: It's been a long time since pressure comps have been active no? It's all about one shots so idk maybe not really that true atm
[5:46:57] Knaxxis: on outlaw rogue i feel alot of my dmg idk
[5:46:58] Getcha_Pulll: im a retail andy and agree with you lol
[5:46:59] zwarlyy: @xaryu also have trouble getting into groups for gnomer unfortunately. Warrior life. But even finding a group and trying to include noob friendly... People will leave if I'm not checking logs and gear. Also, if you wipe once... 2-3 people leave instantly.
[5:47:02] slapshotsd: @realandtruephobe gotcha, fair
[5:47:03] hot6auce: master assassin sub rogue was Pog one shot at start of SL
[5:47:04] Maddiechoo: nothing is worse then hitting combust and seeing the enemies health not budge
[5:47:05] hart_mk1: @Knaxxis yeah sure, they take damage after you line up 50 other modifiers and abilities with a button press
[5:47:06] Roflmaister: all of ally opinions are based on democratic values, and they are not good
[5:47:09] WaterBoxx: @Xaryu Fire Mage - I pre Gnomer bis
[5:47:10] theDRG: You play DH and you see peoples hp go down for sure. Extremely satisfying.
[5:47:11] Timhulbert: I couldn't get a gnomer group on my hunter or warrior, levelling a priest now so I can actually play the raid. People will only take you if you have amazing logs. Will have to wait till it's always killed
[5:47:12] MasterNewt: Xaryu is 100% correct on this, watch arenas to see how it is
[5:47:20] yexpensive: What are your expectations for Cataclysm?
[5:47:20] UltrawideGameGuy: @Roflmaister No.
[5:47:24] Dr0ddy: You think they need to just do WoW 2 or what?
[5:47:28] d30xx: I am playing retail right now and I agree
[5:47:29] Knaxxis: i guess little abilities u dont really feel it but yeah when u line shit up ppl fucking drop tho
[5:47:39] Munchagramz: raiding will be fun
[5:47:42] cookie_jayy: people shit on cata for no reason
[5:47:45] honeykush: it's been only a few seasons where you dont take any damage most seasons especially df is really oneshotty last season of sl where oneshot aswell and especially the end of bfa with corruptions
[5:47:46] tuna_sandw1ch: I asked someone who works retail and they had no idea what I was talking about @Xaryu
[5:47:50] xidzal: What was the last time u played retail @xaryu
[5:47:55] Munchagramz: im just waiting for mop
[5:47:55] Zolshy89: No era servers
[5:47:58] jigawatt21: @Timhulbert I've been 40 for over a week and still cant find a group on my warr its freaking sad dude
[5:47:59] Zolshy89: UKEK
[5:47:59] Roflmaister: there was suppose to be any union of sort of
[5:47:59] zgho3t: everyone playing arena with HC cunning not looking forward to it xD
[5:47:59] MattOriginal: Cata > Wrath
[5:48:00] TEEEEmac: cata was the worst expansion ever released
[5:48:01] frozenpizza2209: vanilla bis, then tbc, then its done
[5:48:02] ribas314: wotlk flopped so hard
[5:48:02] Zolshy89: I KEK
[5:48:05] cory_lockman: game died end of wotlk
[5:48:05] bpwryl: is anyone gonna play that?
[5:48:10] Maddiechoo: I feel like I remember people hating cats when it was current content
[5:48:12] baldanduseless: people will come back to cata for the arena i think but not the pve so much
[5:48:14] tommygunz31: im not playing till they bring BFA classic
[5:48:14] Dr0ddy: I think no Wrath Era servers is bad idea
[5:48:18] Roflmaister: remember alamo
[5:48:20] betterdayz1996: ill play sod all the way to 110. xdjk
[5:48:24] SghettiBoy: yea except condense it over the course of 8-12 months
[5:48:24] TURBO_EXTREME: 10 man heroic raiding is big for the boys though
[5:48:25] Tenebrous04: !death
[5:48:25] StreamElements: Xarsassin dead. https://clips.twitch.tv/EnjoyableCuriousFoxShazBotstix-49zMNiEi0D0O9Cqq
[5:48:25] juddah_: fk cata all my homies hate cata
[5:48:27] Mestema17: my issue with retail is that it's just a rush to endgame vs the journey to get there.
[5:48:27] asloff: L that wod spike thoughLU
[5:48:27] BPD_Catgirl: Cant wait for MoP tho
[5:48:28] hart_mk1: @Knaxxis people don't like the feeling of needing to line up 100 modifiers, it's tedious and boring, that's the point
[5:48:32] asloff: LUL
[5:48:32] hubbardhs: wrath has been so dead for months though
[5:48:34] zen_oni_shinobi: i hope they keep it unmodded but i feel like that's a pretty high expectation for me to have.
[5:48:37] warmupwarri0r: people forget about how much flying mounts changed the old-world (and the old world changes).
[5:48:37] cookie_jayy: Cata pvp was BIS
[5:48:37] normageqq: the reality is that cata players dropped because wrath sucked
[5:48:41] KairuruTV: I ACTUALLY think Cata will do better this time as it is more "retail"esque, and better lockout rules for raids
[5:48:43] ripintides: wrath is pretty dead rn, sucks cause i love it
[5:48:44] Dr0ddy: Where do they stop though?
[5:48:46] Munchagramz: i think mop will be bigger people are more weeby and like that kind of aesthetic these days
[5:48:47] MexredFeral: Cata PvP best
[5:48:50] spergsy: We also wont have it dragging on like it did originally
[5:48:52] baldanduseless: i think it will go from woltk? theres no shadowmourne in cata @Xaryu
[5:48:55] TrixMixTV: number guy
[5:48:57] Adarou: is world of warcraft on steam?
[5:48:57] gunzpewpew: That graph is me and my friends being too addicted to quit despite hating everything about cata
[5:49:03] Lawpings: i'm excited for Cata PVP!! Aren't you Xar?
[5:49:04] ChaoticTrack: @Dr0ddy Maybe. I think part of what made early WoW great was (1) 2000s culture and (2) that they had only put a few years into it - the game only had what they thought was necessary to ship it
[5:49:04] bpwryl: Do poll on who will try cata, I think it lacks the nostalgia pull of the other classics
[5:49:06] Knaxxis: @hart_mk1  i diasagree i believe it requires skill to line thigns up and do ur dmg and not just frostbolt or sinister strike into eviserate and they die lol
[5:49:09] yexpensive: i like rbg games
[5:49:10] hot6auce: cata arena was fun, but as with tbc + wotlk classic will probably be ruined by sweatlords
[5:49:13] tottodota: Mop was goat
[5:49:14] Roflmaister: union, lol. more like i am alone
[5:49:15] ARROOCE: @KairuruTV thats exactly why it will not do better, if you like an "retail"esque game you would play retail LULW
[5:49:15] muhmonkey: i wish they would just make a new wow instead of endlessly milking the one they have
[5:49:16] ribas314: but that's when wow started to decline, if mop came before cata, more ppl would have played mop
[5:49:16] dizzypeezy: @KairuruTV no relaunch is never better, cat will be fun for first month only then all people will be cba
[5:49:18] kirk_hunts: who needed a gnomer group?
[5:49:18] zgho3t: @Xaryu will you go fire mage in cata with HC cunning pog?
[5:49:19] Dr0ddy: What does classic WoW look like in 5 years?
[5:49:21] Toshiba16: i would play mop but your progression gets deleted and its a big turn off @Xaryu
[5:49:21] DeathToad007: cata made me quit wow forever
[5:49:22] kriethos: @MexredFeral it was so stupid, full pve gear
[5:49:22] Maddiechoo: what do you think they should about classic after mop?
[5:49:25] tuna_sandw1ch: burning crusade was SO FUN
[5:49:26] Kohhzee: Classic BFA soon boyz
[5:49:27] KairuruTV: Cataclysm will be more RETAIL players than Classic players
[5:49:27] cookie_jayy: has tons of nostalgia for me
[5:49:31] Catalystic_Sudo: IM DEFFO PLAY CATA💙💙💙
[5:49:35] MerleisAirdburneDF: cata isnt classic, its when the game became bad
[5:49:40] Bakes00: cant wait for classic legion
[5:49:43] SoSoBurrito: do you even cata bro? cohhAiming guzuExplain
[5:49:46] Bytefish: cata is launching the same time the war within no?
[5:49:47] bonathan114: I wonder why that is, that the nostalgia drops off in cata
[5:49:47] SunYuHong: Cata is where they destroyed the classic world
[5:49:48] Vugaddii: im playing cata, just bc it leads to MoP Classic
[5:49:48] houstontx281: Cata had some of the best pvp
[5:49:50] Kellvig: Cata was good enough
[5:49:52] bonathan114: cause it’s true
[5:49:53] Knaxxis: cata is not classic new talent tree
[5:49:56] ribas314: I had fun playing cata
[5:49:57] Quaras_: Never played original Cata, but for some reason I don't feel like playing this one
[5:49:58] warmupwarri0r: it just killed the old world that everyone fell in love with.
[5:49:59] krewshie: @Xaryu I still think about the story you told about that mage sword from naxx
[5:50:01] walruscow: I quit in cata
[5:50:02] TrixMixTV: March 22 Dragon Dogma
[5:50:03] cookie_jayy: Cta did not get a new talent tree
[5:50:05] voidtouched_93: its middle aged wow
[5:50:05] hubbardhs: cata will probably lose most players when another sod phase releases
[5:50:06] cookie_jayy: that was mop
[5:50:07] pezs1234: Why do you think cata made the game worse?
[5:50:08] sengip: 100% when the game got lame af
[5:50:09] Aka_Gami: Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK = people's happy memories up till college. Cata = people quitting and growing up. generally speaking
[5:50:09] awsdlife: Mop was my favorite expansioon
[5:50:11] Azzucai: A lot of people found new friends in BC/wrath that they want to just continue to play with so they move to whatevers next
[5:50:12] frozenpizza2209: they should just relaunch vanilla instead of cata lol
[5:50:14] DiddiThe1: It's pretty classic to me.
[5:50:16] Christarpher: The thing about cata is you can just still play it right now in retail
[5:50:17] Lincolnl0g: maybe it’s better to say, cata is when the vanilla dynamic shifted into something else. became divisive.
[5:50:20] JoaEUW: It's because Cata you can basically play all the content now in retail, but before cata content you can't play in retail
[5:50:20] whamtv: i felt like classic era ended when they updated character models and changed the talent system in MoP @Xaryu
[5:50:22] Vugaddii: MoP HYPE
[5:50:23] cookie_jayy: Cata still had classic talent tree
[5:50:23] Mango84: Mop was bad
[5:50:25] juice42069: anything before latest expansion is technically classic
[5:50:26] tottodota: 1. MOP 2. LEGION 3. CATA
[5:50:27] Zuut_: Cata is Retail-Lite. Which might be intriguing for the classic andys
[5:50:28] slapshotsd: @warmupwarri0r honestly now that we've had like 15 years of perspective i do think the old world revamp is mostly terrible
[5:50:28] hart_mk1: @Knaxxis and a lot of people don't care about "skill" in pressing 20 buttons perfectly on a prepull for one spec. that's not skill that's being a mathematician
[5:50:29] Roflmaister: democrats can only assert power through taxes
[5:50:34] kirk_hunts: Xar did you know you can cast chronostatic preservation while channeling and not break evocation or arcane missiles?
[5:50:37] Mahca_: Cata might attract more retail players that just want to do the old raids
[5:50:39] walruscow: I think they're just doing cata to keep the lights on while they figure out how to make sod permanent
[5:50:40] DynamicTV18: cata is when i started playing wow so the nostalgia is there for me, im excited for it
[5:50:40] rocknsake: cataclysm was literally the end of the world
[5:50:44] rocknsake: they destroyed the world
[5:50:45] gotcha2157: cata could be fun now that i have a better understanding of the game lol
[5:50:48] Lincolnl0g: maybe it’s better to say, cata is when the vanilla dynamic shifted into something else. became divisive
[5:50:55] draxanlee: I quit on Cata and came back briefly on WoD, then Legion, and finally quit for good and became a twitch viewer :)
[5:50:56] lolstyled: stv in 7 maybe?
[5:50:56] JayyyRS: fax
[5:50:58] Grimadin: personally i feel like cata was ahead of it's time. dungeons got really hard and people didn't want to bother doing dungeon mechanics. so peolple quit and said the game was bad
[5:50:59] zebercetanayurt: that's a good point
[5:51:00] tuna_sandw1ch: can we shift this to politics?
[5:51:02] Jacobra1738: good point.
[5:51:02] alrik_plays: Pikewho?
[5:51:06] Maddiechoo: I think mop would do a better job of that
[5:51:07] frozenpizza2209: RDF and transmog = garbage
[5:51:07] Knaxxis: @hart_mk1  im sorry but thats most casual grey parse opinion ive evr sene im sorry but u r a classic andy im a retail player so its gonna be hard to agree my man im sorry
[5:51:08] Zenfar_: 75% of cata was pretty good it just ended badly with the dragon soul patch
[5:51:08] tuna_sandw1ch: or religion
[5:51:11] d30xx: cata is dead on release, tier sets were trash
[5:51:12] yexpensive: nice
[5:51:12] slapshotsd: @Grimadin yeah cata heroics fun af
[5:51:14] cory_lockman: Dragonflight is better than Cata
[5:51:14] NotTheWheel: I just feel like classic was important because it brought the old world we lost... feel like if you want to play "Cata" you can already do that in retail kinda
[5:51:14] Roflmaister: ally junkies make more junkies
[5:51:15] JoaEUW: Yeah Pika is 16 now right
[5:51:15] Harenzo: Activision bought Blizzard in 2008 and Cata was the expansion after that.
[5:51:16] hot6auce: it was MoP when talents went to shit right?
[5:51:18] cookie_jayy: I remember Pika in cata
[5:51:18] MattOriginal: Cata actually got mechanics that required higher than room temp IQ, Classic Andys want their one button 99 parses, so they don't like it.
[5:51:18] Munchagramz: Same thats why im lookin
[5:51:19] UltrawideGameGuy: I thought pika is 12 now
[5:51:19] Whole_Cake_Island: elistaPls
[5:51:21] booddhi: or not
[5:51:22] ChaoticTrack: I started playing at the end of Cata and enjoyed MoP, but lost interest after that. I've played a bit of classic since (retail and private) and it feels closer to the wonder I had as a kid when I saw WoW in ads and computer cafes
[5:51:22] Erockk610: call him
[5:51:23] proteinbar___: Would you be interested in competitive Cata Arena?
[5:51:25] Dr0ddy: Did you watch the new Azamous video? Kinda relevant to this convo. Only like 5 minutes long
[5:51:26] YuraruY: wait is pika not 12 now?
[5:51:27] amarv: retair andys joining? I'm out
[5:51:31] PitLordsPeasant: I'm definitly exited to try cata pvp I have a good memory of it
[5:51:32] davesodave: isnt pika like 15 now
[5:51:33] whamtv: cata arenas take skill, so pika cant play
[5:51:34] warmupwarri0r: @slapshotsd when you add flying mounts everywhere, it also has issues. I think the SOD is amazing because the level cap and zones are populated. it's not gonna happen in cta
[5:51:35] frozenpizza2209: Item design was trash after tbc sadly :D
[5:51:36] slapshotsd: @hart_mk1 it's literally skill
[5:51:38] dizzypeezy: cata will be only good for first month and it will die
[5:51:38] gunzpewpew: My IRL started in Cata and it was his fav exp
[5:51:38] toddypoo: Pika always says the best expansion is the current one
[5:51:42] Mubistar: cata is almost like wotlk
[5:51:43] Catalystic_Sudo: wotlk/cata was my start so I’m pumped to replay it💪🏻
[5:51:43] eddjr77: you can teach him how to arena in cata
[5:51:44] kumbajastero: 13 wow
[5:51:45] tastyjustt: cata arena will be wild
[5:51:48] morphis1792: I didint like what they did to stats in cata like int not increasing mana.. dungeons were lit tho
[5:51:49] hart_mk1: @Knaxxis i never said you had to agree, that was never my point, my point is to try to get you to understand why ppl prefer classic
[5:51:50] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[5:51:54] AngelasAmusements: I went from retail to classic and cringed. I have played since vanilla and I forgot how much I appreciate the new advances to the game. LOL I still hate Dragonflight. LOL
[5:51:54] hart_mk1: @slapshotsd thanks
[5:51:58] ripintides: or pika will play for a month, not see all the flashing lights of retail and go back
[5:52:01] yexpensive: pvp cata and mob are the bests
[5:52:02] Knaxxis: @hart_mk1  oh i def get it
[5:52:03] Auphyr: !assassin
[5:52:03] StreamElements: ASSASSIN HC CHALLENGE = DAGGERS ONLY + CLOTH ROBE (dark brotherhood style assassin role play); ALLIANCE DEFIAS PILLAGER
[5:52:05] tottodota: Would u play MOP?
[5:52:08] ndras: pika waiting that war within beta not cata
[5:52:11] ashraf_ma: @Xaryu My first expansion was Dragonflight but im excited to play Cata
[5:52:11] pullem: the return of scoob will be cool in cata
[5:52:16] zen_oni_shinobi: @xaryu. so during the end of tbc original, my buddys and i sitting estimating the hp pools and damage output classes would have in wrath, and thought that rogues having you know..11-12k baseline hp and their dmg output being proportionate was crazy.
[5:52:19] Vugaddii: MoP is the answer
[5:52:20] warmupwarri0r: wait for war within?
[5:52:21] Munchagramz: WOW 2
[5:52:22] WaterBoxx: anyone doing Gnomer? would appreciate getting into a group
[5:52:22] kirk_hunts: have you tried casting chronostatic preservation while channeling any mage ability
[5:52:23] sengip: Cata is when the game was ruined. I played Vanilla, TBC, wraith, and cata was 100% the downfall of the game. Everything was so easy
[5:52:24] SghettiBoy: maybe just dont play
[5:52:27] Drase0117: @AngelasAmusements xd
[5:52:29] Caledvwych: I think that the wrath nostalgia is milked now we are so far into the xpac, its time to move on regardless of statistics.
[5:52:29] KIILLINIT: Wonder if Blizz will pay Pika to stream Cata
[5:52:29] pumpkinplants: mop hype
[5:52:29] normageqq: cata is basically the same as wrath, it's weird to say otherwise imo
[5:52:32] Knaxxis: @hart_mk1  the past year i played classic on whitemane and killed ky many times and i understand the socal aspect and the simplicity of the classes and rotations
[5:52:32] ripintides: does that mean he liked shadowlands? arguably one of the worst expansions
[5:52:36] mywukie: MoP pvp was so cool
[5:52:38] Roflmaister: classic is nice when you do shoulders
[5:52:39] ndras: pandas LUL
[5:52:40] Thrively: mop was the best pvp hands down
[5:52:41] WargasmHS: i started with vanilla beta
[5:52:45] Munchagramz: yep
[5:52:46] Duokkis: Make a poll for the best expansion
[5:52:48] zen_oni_shinobi: @xaryu if you had told us back then that characters would be like they were in legion we'd have said you were crazy or we weren't playing because it wasn't world of warcraft.
[5:52:53] kenxxys: isnt that all of classic
[5:52:56] DeathToad007: i nvere played mop so i got you
[5:52:58] NazguL1985: true
[5:53:00] KIILLINIT: Not me, I played for a month
[5:53:02] sengip: Cata is when the game was ruined. I played Vanilla, TBC, wraith, and cata was 100% the downfall of the game. Everything was so easy @Xaryu
[5:53:02] ramfunky: No
[5:53:04] Thejacob250: Blood Moon about to pop
[5:53:08] Dr0ddy: SoD progression servers?
[5:53:08] realandtruephobe: !Ag1
[5:53:09] StreamElements: To get a 1 year supply of Vitamin D + 5 individual travel packs FREE with your first purchase, go to https://drinkag1.com/xaryu
[5:53:09] ChaoticTrack: I liked Pandaria
[5:53:10] Munchagramz: mop was the first expanssion where streaming became big to
[5:53:11] DeathToad007: i only did pet battles
[5:53:11] AngelasAmusements: I play until I'm 60 then create a new character. LOL I actually just got my Waste of Time yesterday and I've been going through and doing acheivements, getting mounts, toys, appearances, pets.
[5:53:12] asloff: War within hype?
[5:53:15] detourz28: At least with SoD we have a little change of pace
[5:53:16] TikiTopper: Blizz needs to keep going something to increase subs...they win by taking old content and getting more subs from people that wouldnt pay monthly to play retail
[5:53:18] rocknsake: WoW needs a realm reborn
[5:53:19] Neckro89: MoP gameplay but without the pandas NODDERS
[5:53:19] rocknsake: 2.0
[5:53:20] ashraf_ma: @Xaryu What would bring back your interest in retail ?
[5:53:24] tastyjustt: sod arena rating would be insane
[5:53:28] DeathToad007: sod isnt exactly brand new my man
[5:53:29] Viisionz74: Still recycled content not brand new
[5:53:31] brwmopoutano: wow is deaaaaaad wow is deaaaaad
[5:53:33] UnKillableSold: its not new content but its something that went away and bringing it back for a limited time will attract ppl for some time at least
[5:53:35] taylorsdank: can you make my new char an officer when you get the chance :) *i died*
[5:53:35] voidtouched_93: tbc was sick too. wrath was meh.
[5:53:36] Kohhzee: I wonder if people will play more retail War Within or classic War Within next year
[5:53:36] netfiend777: blizz is stretching everything out just relaunching games. just stick with classic era or retail.
[5:53:38] NotTheWheel: I feel like Cata, MoP are all modern enough you can go back and play that content if you wanted.
[5:53:39] Bakes00: we NEED wow 2...best elements from classic and retail combined
[5:53:39] sttvit: sttvit subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[5:53:42] gunzpewpew: I think mop is going to have ALOT of traction actually. It is the bridge between boomers and zoomers
[5:53:44] bonathan114: remember when there were commercials for wow, those were crazy times
[5:53:46] alexbilbaoo: see SoM kek
[5:53:47] kilpisito: What you think of SoD bro
[5:53:48] Cpt_Titus: classic was long time inbetween like the other exps ppl forget stuff and will want to play again :)
[5:53:48] ribas314: But strictly speaking of pve and raids, cata was a good expansion
[5:53:50] ScryerTV: Classic Era is alive tho
[5:53:55] LexaproNLattes: @DeathToad007 Really? Did you play SoD in the past?
[5:53:57] jstuwie: Ozzy for Wotlk
[5:53:59] upliftp: People shit on retail, but if you're a competitive player it's just so fun. Title M+ keys and Mythic Raiding is an experience that nothing in Classic matches. Can understand it not being as great an experience anymore for casual players though, learning curve is a cliff at this point.
[5:54:05] bpwryl: Cata hardcore xarTroll
[5:54:06] upliftp: New content breathes life
[5:54:08] ripintides: SOD really barely has any new content, just new buttons
[5:54:10] brwmopoutano: worst comunity after leauge
[5:54:10] DeathToad007: @LexaproNLattes 90% of the content is the same
[5:54:12] ARROOCE: @ScryerTV stop the cope bro its one server with a couple raiding guilds, thats not alive LULW
[5:54:12] Kisotope: World of Starcraft
[5:54:16] AngelasAmusements: Well, Microsoft bought it last year so it's already doomed.
[5:54:20] redgerobin: wait does war within get fresh servers?
[5:54:20] Dr0ddy: Disagree, they find their audience eventually. Example: Classic Era
[5:54:21] ripintides: @DeathToad007 agree
[5:54:24] cookie_jayy: LUL
[5:54:25] warmupwarri0r: wrath was alright, but the ulduar choices and patch sucks for a lot of classes. It was no effort on dev side but had a lot of frustrations for feral and warr
[5:54:27] ChaoticTrack: Blizz needs to give people reasons to keep coming back rather than reasons to not leave
[5:54:29] Maehdras18: you mean you don't want to raid just naxx for the next 20 years?
[5:54:30] KIILLINIT: add shinies , profit
[5:54:31] xprobutterrz: make any other 'world of' games from their other games.  Would be amazing
[5:54:34] pumpkinplants: so much pressuire
[5:54:34] Aka_Gami: @Xaryu It does lose players. Everquest has been doing these servers for years. Later xpacs fall down to 1 guild clearing xpacs, while the devs start "fresh" new servers every year that pop off
[5:54:38] zen0vae: @upliftp agree, love M+ and raiding in retail even this late into the season
[5:54:38] SghettiBoy: @ripintides new buttons, new pvp, new quests, new currency, new raids wtf
[5:54:40] Bakes00: what game is better for a casual? classic or retail?
[5:54:44] LexaproNLattes: @DeathToad007 Really? 905? So every event, raid, rune, that all = 10% of the game to you
[5:54:58] direwolf575: @bakes00 classic sod
[5:54:58] ramfunky: Yeah m+ and raiding in retail isn't bad
[5:55:00] slapshotsd: @Bakes00 classic by a mile
[5:55:05] GallowayOW: i really hope theyre gonna do classic + and not just try to do different seasons
[5:55:08] upliftp: @Bakes00 depends on what you want. Retail is endgame focus, Classic is more evenly spread out across leveling + endgame
[5:55:11] realandtruephobe: The pillagers claim another one!
[5:55:15] ripintides: @SghettiBoy and almost all of that is old and done by max level KEKW
[5:55:16] upliftp: both are fun
[5:55:17] AbyssReborn: STV starting
[5:55:17] ramfunky: Classic takes hella long to lvl up
[5:55:17] jstuwie: tru
[5:55:18] Kettopossum: NODDERS
[5:55:18] sengip: Cata is when the game was ruined. I played Vanilla, TBC, wraith, and cata was 100% the downfall of the game. Everything was so easy...
[5:55:18] KIILLINIT: CoD is the same basically
[5:55:23] muhmonkey: i mean they do a great job. people pay subscription for 20 year old content ^^

[5:55:37] cookie_jayy: classic WoD Pog
[5:55:37] Vugaddii: i would live on MoP era
[5:55:38] Zoismoe: @Xaryu crazy thing is.. people havent stopped raiding nax for 20 years since p servers
[5:55:40] Knaxxis: solved content doesnt have a long shelf life outside of die hard fan bases
[5:55:42] rica3d0: cata made me stop playing
[5:55:42] Bakes00: thanks @direwolf575  @slapshotsd @upliftp
[5:55:47] NotTheWheel: I don't want to ALWAYS raid naxx for the next 20 years... but I will return to raid naxx every couple of years. I think that's fair to say. ebbs and flows like any game.

[5:58:40] roskiyeta: wrath top 1
[5:58:46] Moccawow: Think cata over tbc no?
[5:58:47] realrednalooz: Not that you ever played on one Kappa
[5:58:49] valeriuz: wrath > era
[5:58:53] monaflipas: need legion
[5:59:08] NowStreamingFullTimeKappa: wotlk was peak players so lot of nostalgia for people
[5:59:08] YuraruY: i played warmane wotlk and apollo 3 cataclysm
[5:59:08] HainezyAU: HainezyAU subscribed with Prime. 
[5:59:09] Shuboonda: @Moccawow warmane's TBC server was massive when fresh launches happened compared to Cata servers
[5:59:13] Alucardz6: wrath was always more popular than vanilla by far
[5:59:19] FeineeWildfireSirena: I need MOP again :(
[5:59:20] valeriuz: warmane still rocks
[5:59:25] tottodota: MOP just 2 exp ago then
[5:59:27] Toshiba16: makes sense
[5:59:27] gunzpewpew: These are all the private servers that ever existed before blizzard started takng serious legal action though
[5:59:30] zerozuckerl: any rising gods enjoyers
[5:59:31] NotTheWheel: naw
[5:59:32] MasterNewt: Cata and beyond has the revamped world you can still see today. Earlier iterations meant exploring world as it was.

[5:59:39] ndras: true
[5:59:40] Quaras_: Wrath had country specific private servers
[5:59:40] xprobutterrz: time to retire WoW, and make world of starcraft
[5:59:44] rayzerpls: I think mop has much more hype than cata right now
[5:59:45] NotTheWheel: Warmane was up there but not vanilla levels
[5:59:47] Munchagramz: classic had so many varients
[5:59:47] etox_tv: Wrath is more popular by a big margin actually
[5:59:50] Maddiechoo: do you think they should leave up a wrath server?
[5:59:51] Adda_77: molten cata days
[5:59:56] angylogan: nostral and feenix elysium all had more than AT and Warmane
[5:59:56] cory_lockman: Warmane is corrupt now. It's ran by the donators now
[5:59:58] TheBeaverQueen: I dont think Wrath pserver were more popular than Nost and Northdale
[6:00:01] realrednalooz: How do you know the server names Xar?
[6:00:01] realandtruephobe: what is the deadliest mob in the game in HC?
[6:00:03] Eternal_Emz: shadowlands pvp season 3 and 4 were pretty fun imo

[6:00:08] frozenpizza2209: Warmane fake numbers :D
[6:00:11] TheBeaverQueen: and Kronos
[6:00:14] Alucardz6: there was like 1 good vanilla server, how many wrath tho? just look at warmane's numbers
[6:00:15] jeneraljelly: people just making shit up in chat LMAO xD
[6:00:18] n3v3ts247: warmane wrath servers where insane 10yrs ago
[6:00:19] NotTheWheel: I'm still a turtle boy when it comes to vanilla anyways
[6:00:19] ashraf_ma: MoP is the new wrath @Xaryu
[6:00:19] valeriuz: warmane lordaeron is still good imo
[6:00:20] teriko_: ED was the only good vanilla server
[6:00:22] Dr0ddy: I just want Shadowlands classic so I can grind torghast again
[6:00:26] TwoTimesTheOne: fake numbers go log in and walk in dalaran retard @frozenpizza2209
[6:00:33] Yokedo: nothing was bigger than nost

[6:00:38] omnipresentbe1ng: warmane is fake pop so u donate to skill q right now
[6:00:38] bobban1234: when will ''classic'' cata be out?
[6:00:40] samwelltarly88: whats the addon called where it shows the energy regeneration ?? @xaryu
[6:00:43] citrusjuice: I think the fact that MOP was more recent plays agaisnt it because less time for Nostalgia to sink in etc... but in reality i think MOP was one of the best expansions
[6:00:50] Jullsan: nost was like 800,000 players
[6:00:51] ripintides: warmane dedge now for sure]
[6:00:52] YuraruY: @valeriuz not for someone who's just starting, its full of elitist ppl

[6:01:21] frozenpizza2209: AT was tbc right
[6:01:24] NotTheWheel: I think Cata by itself is kinda meh. They should have been like Cata-Mop (Era) and it just goes in a cycle
[6:01:27] darkmagi2: what' AT?
[6:01:31] zen_oni_shinobi: arena tournemtn
[6:01:32] teriko_: feenix was almost like real vanilla everyone was garbage

[6:01:52] enzo_xc: What do you think they will do with era after cata
[6:01:53] Spart7nz: that would bnhe epic
[6:01:55] mrbluesky1337: yea i played those

[6:02:10] ChaoticTrack: vibes
[6:02:10] UnKillableSold: Private Fun Servers :D but problem was that they made them pay to win
[6:02:11] witdashotboi: @acaciashrub Timeless Isle enjoyers unite, what a time to be alive
[6:02:11] Shuboonda: @enzo_xc question of the decade for blizzard
[6:02:12] Daggerem: I like wotlk but are they just gonna keep going after cata?
[6:02:13] krienth: fuck yes.
[6:02:13] euclyptus: thatd be fun af
[6:02:17] zen_oni_shinobi: actually was how we got into blizzcon was making it to rating on arena tournament int bc
[6:02:18] SgtPepperTTV: There was a PTR server that had everything I am trying to remember why it was
[6:02:19] Wallscast: yea they need pvpers to buy gold so they cant do that lol
[6:02:19] zen_oni_shinobi: in tbc
[6:02:19] NowStreamingFullTimeKappa: PTR back in the day was similar
[6:02:24] dreadnaughttier98: i remember being at gurubashi arena for that too, miss those servers
[6:02:27] frozenpizza2209: Solo queue arena is nice
[6:02:27] ndras: there was transmog, free faction change, race change etc
[6:02:29] ashraf_ma: Retail is kind of like that with how easy it is to gear up & level @Xaryu
[6:02:31] omnipresentbe1ng: also cd reset on duels Kreygasm
[6:02:35] NotTheWheel: @Xaryu I'd call that a Vallhala realm. XD Sounds like viking heaven
[6:02:35] Munchagramz: and s this "AT" in the room with us now?
[6:02:37] kyotoprime231: what's the challenge?
[6:02:39] edit93: that would be amazing to test new classes
[6:02:39] stuart805: i would fucking love a pvp exclusive server with max everything given and you can run RBGs and Arena... with a actual cycling season system
[6:02:47] enzo_xc: @Shuboonda kinda wish they just stopped at WOTLK, now it feels like they will just keep going
[6:02:48] Spart7nz: why dont u arena anymore\
[6:02:48] cookie_jayy: i think that would be sick
[6:02:48] Dr0ddy: That with cosmetic rewards would be lit
[6:02:54] hutchyy917: @kyotoprime231 pvp is the challenge
[6:02:55] realrednalooz: westfall music really setting the nostalgia vibes
[6:02:58] GallowayOW: without incentives that will be dead
[6:02:59] Eternal_Emz: the way you describe A.T sounds like heaven

[6:03:22] c3relki11er: gogogogogogoggo
[6:03:22] Dr0ddy: dopamine pole
[6:03:23] NotTheWheel: I think Blizzard should go the path of letting people run official Private Servers for a cost. That way people can have whatever flavor of WoW they want.
[6:03:24] bushthebug: !footcam
[6:03:30] bokibremofobeast: ye there were alot pvt srvs like that
[6:03:32] c3relki11er: killkillkillkill
[6:03:33] UnKillableSold: @neodude24 i dont think so (yet)
[6:03:39] zykson123: private servers have really good ideas sometimes
[6:03:39] woad_: adhd arenas KEKWS
[6:03:43] probeu: dead game andys are the worst
[6:03:50] NotTheWheel: it's also solo
[6:03:50] luckdog55: At 60 I haven't been able to get a dungeon group in 2 days
[6:03:51] NotTheWheel: so
[6:03:52] taglinetv: I would never consider solo games "dead"
[6:03:52] voidtouched_93: the community is alive
[6:03:52] baldanduseless: why do you raid the bait comments @Xaryu
[6:03:54] Munchagramz: twich has moved on but players are still there

[6:04:13] zUg_zUg_: more than OG community
[6:04:13] Kazay1998: Isn't one of the problems also that it's on the old servers?
[6:04:25] GallowayOW: they should have made a fresh HC server for it
[6:04:26] NotTheWheel: Think SoD has put people into raidlog brain.. not ready to go back to hardcore yet
[6:04:31] UnKillableSold: always the initial launch on anything blizzard made exploded, regardless if later on it declined a lot or less
[6:04:32] pegseleven: ooof what robe you rockin atm
[6:04:36] Lincolnl0g: prolly lots of layers rn too which will make the large population rn counterintuitively make it feel more dead
[6:04:39] realandtruephobe: I wonder how the SoDcore guild is doing. Some good folks in there
[6:04:48] Cian161: damn you got me, im slacking

[6:15:04] Mico027: SoD should stay seasonal, just like SoM

[6:15:13] rote367: I do wish SSF unlocked all professions on 1 toon
[6:15:15] ChaoticTrack: I imagine most of the people who worked on early WoW have left Blizz by now... a game is made by people at the end of the day.
[6:15:16] ashraf_ma: SoD is going to retail KEKW bc it's beta testing realm
[6:15:19] Dr0ddy: They mentioned these characters going somewhere special after season is over
[6:15:19] realandtruephobe: first crit over 100?
[6:15:21] Reaperz_kinetic: the thing is thats not our jobs...... thats LITERALLY their jobs... if theres an issue they should have enough people and resources to properly address it. if they cant then they dont have the right people employed or in charge
[6:15:21] SghettiBoy: its really the only wow i care about rn
[6:15:22] jeneraljelly: Gnomer #'s tanked so they added huge exp boosts

[6:15:35] mirra_go_vegan: Did SoD got success so far?
[6:15:37] amexpog: I love sod perfect version of wow, it needs improvement but is a solid base for future "expansions"
[6:15:46] bigsockets: it will get smaller and smaller the higher lvl cap goes
[6:15:47] fuchai: I think blizz is looking at SoD as Classic plus
[6:15:47] realandtruephobe: Does it surprise anyone else that SoD is free? I was expecting to pay for it when they announced.
[6:15:54] wulfgar___: should let them make player raids
[6:15:56] unclegez: OSRS has been doing it for over 10 year now
[6:15:56] Dr0ddy: Deadmines raid when
[6:16:00] shadowvypers: the boar meat is for a cooking recipe btw
[6:16:00] wulfgar___: and players maps

[6:16:33] bpwryl: How will they compete with the profitability of retail unless they introduce micro transactions?
[6:16:35] Mico027: SoD litteraly made me reinstall WoW and resub since TBC rerelease
[6:16:35] mirra_go_vegan: What would be fun for YOU?
[6:16:36] Dr0ddy: Big mistake
[6:16:37] SghettiBoy: Keep SOD in AZEROTH
[6:16:40] thestairpusher: agreed
[6:16:40] WalkingLT: Westfall or Azshara
[6:16:41] Reaperz_kinetic: @fuchai there wont be a sod tbc
[6:16:44] mykle90: People play wow way different now. They follow a BIS list and when its achived their character is complete and "there is nothing to do".
[6:16:45] RAGINGELEMENTAL: They should just expand on classic and make it more than it was
[6:16:52] baldanduseless: sunken temple will be so fun @Xaryu
[6:16:54] GallowayOW: i lowkey think theyll just do a different season of classic wow and no classic plus
[6:16:54] BadMicro: We want new in the old world
[6:16:55] voidtouched_93: waht if they made new dungeons and raids for TBC tho?

[6:29:04] sneaks94: early cata dungeons sounds fun. I remember heroic being pretty difficult

[6:29:20] TaNGoIX: @ashraf_ma I mean I'm a retail player and Im fully addicted to SoD lol

[6:30:03] Mestema17: except for the hyperspawns in caves when there are a lot of people.
[6:30:06] Mawanaki: caves are less fun when it's empty cuz all the people
[6:30:08] Wallscast: TRUE
[6:30:09] tuna_sandw1ch: hardcore= san fran, chicago and other haven cities basically

[6:30:16] theeboognish: Wonder if they'll change spine of deathwing heroic.  I don't think classic players are ready for that.

[6:32:28] mr_jimmm: I need a sick name for my rouge, any ideas?
[6:32:31] Stingin: level 60 feels freaking amazing in hardcore right now, theres not many people on at your time, every end game zone you always see at least 1 60 and usually you group up with them to get quests done or rep farming, i truly love it
[6:32:38] Lincolnl0g: @primatemelissa it’s so safe in HC tho

[6:33:58] Mobely__: ppl cheesed the fuck out of it
[6:33:58] iBanEvader: @Xaryu SF needs all professions enabled
[6:34:02] hotzeblotz: havent played after lvl 30 because there was no challenge with trading
[6:34:02] Wallscast: auction house scuffed hardcore for sure
[6:34:03] iBanEvader: for 1 char
[6:34:03] bonanzabrandon: SSF only to lvl 60
[6:34:08] neodude24: It should have only been SF and nothing else
[6:34:09] redgerobin: SF HC is so pure that y we all agree
[6:34:14] Kisotope_: the profession thing could be looked at
[6:34:15] AceOfFlame: I wouldnt of played HC if it was SF at beginning and only SF
[6:34:15] HelluvaWrecks: SSF but youre not limited to 2 professions
[6:34:17] iBanEvader: @Xaryu SF needs all professions enabled for 1 char
[6:34:20] Lincolnl0g: I was dumbfounded to find that blizzards version of HC did not take after their direct inspiration of SSF
[6:34:22] kaos_1987: I found the "official" hc more EZ than with the addon... but I died anyway
[6:34:22] Skweril: the negatives ARE the positives

[6:35:23] RadlockeTV: iff blizz wanted to continue to innovate hardcore where do they go from here?
[6:35:29] Napknutt: is it still hardcore at 60?
[6:35:34] Stingin: @Lincolnl0g yep! Exactly! :D
[6:35:40] realandtruephobe: Do you keep the SF buff at 60 or no? Any way to tell you lvled to 60 while SF?

[6:36:16] derpyllama420: SF or SSF?

[6:36:16] GallowayOW: world of warcraft is not a hard game
[6:36:17] Mestema17: it would have taken longer
[6:36:17] baldanduseless: keep petri remove dungeon log out
[6:36:17] Retrozappa: @iBanEvader No Brainer :D
[6:36:20] PMA_1: the berger would have killed KT
[6:36:22] Lincolnl0g: they’d just relevel yea
[6:36:24] heyitsken_: Frontier was a group of gamers, dont take away their accolades
[6:36:26] AceOfFlame: people acting like frontier had hard time hitting 60 OMEGALUL
[6:36:34] Sainai_: you underestimate that a lot of ppl wouldnt even start hc then bc of solo and they want to play with friends.
[6:36:36] grkgemini94: what a massive waste of time that would be for a temporary ego trip LUL
[6:36:36] Retrozappa: @iBanEvader play retail you NoBrainer
[6:36:45] Dr0ddy: Remember they added Tabard of Frost as a reward for getting to 60 without dying in SoM

[6:37:08] Knowmadic89: hows the GSF going?
[6:37:09] PMA_1: mizkif would have killed KT
[6:37:11] TaNGoIX: Tab of frost is a Prime reward? lol
[6:37:11] Dr0ddy: In Season of Mastery
[6:37:13] baldeyx: no petris makes it so much harder. 1 fuck up and u can have 30+ die

[6:39:00] azaruuu: @johnnyzampano LUL MyAvatar
[6:39:03] baldeyx: @Reaperz_kinetic i do get why petri is cheese, but all petris do is prevent fails from erasing everyones characters. If im in a 40m raid I dont wanna be at the mercy of one idiot. Usually the person who dies deserved it and the rest get to keep their characters (raid ruined tho)
[6:39:04] Kisotope_: @Xaryu If able to be implemented, would you be interested in 3v3 makgora tourney?

[6:49:16] icerainz: hard disagree
[6:49:17] TaNGoIX: Agree
[6:49:17] r4men_noodle: its slow
[6:49:17] AceOfFlame: ya i never struggled in HC both playing warrior in SF unofficial and official, HC is a casual mode
[6:49:17] OgdenTheTavernOwner: sod chilled. alterac and pvp gear soon pl0x
[6:49:19] Mawanaki: it's chill - you take ur time
[6:49:19] Kazunya_Meowryu: Hey xar is stonefist still in solo?
[6:49:19] Jergolini: Hardcore is very chill in my opinion but def has it's moments
[6:49:20] Aka_Gami: Agree, but some people just really aren't built for it
[6:49:21] Stormyflames0530: Me personally I don't care for the really old WoW content like classic/tbc and even wotlk. If they bring back MoP I might play for that cause it's just a more modern game
[6:49:21] the1cetea: 💯 agree
[6:49:22] nicoslater9: Mma fighter here
[6:49:22] BPmana: idk
[6:49:23] rominos88: agree. its all about the journey, you make your own

[6:49:24] m8trex: xarDing
[6:49:25] lateloll: @bigwilly3737 yes they can xD
[6:49:26] Whoneedspace: it definitely can be casual but also can be not
[6:49:27] fjayve: it is casual. you go at your own pace . it’s you against yourself
[6:49:28] bumblebeetoona: gz
[6:49:29] Joryland: xarDing
[6:49:29] LifeOfSponge: xarDing xarDing xarDing
[6:49:29] Catalystic_Sudo: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[6:49:30] prescp: agreed which is why it surprising that you like it
[6:49:32] jmacc1259: its because you only do easy farming and quests, an occasional dungeon
[6:49:33] Whoneedspace: it depends on your challenges and if you grind green mobs or what
[6:49:33] baldeyx: u have to know what ur doing in HC. a total noob would get annihilated and get nowhere
[6:49:35] Kosmicpanther: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[6:49:36] Kisotope_: xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing xarDing
[6:49:38] Gorakk82: HC is more about knowledge over being sweaty
[6:49:38] PunChE_Who: 100% agree
[6:49:43] plae007: HC def casual, you can make it as easy as you want, take ur time, solo.  Def casual
[6:49:45] Whoneedspace: some people do naked runs yknow
[6:49:46] Romans_I_XVI: It's as casual as you make it
[6:49:47] ggbr0sky: ssf is challanging but satill casual
[6:49:49] bigwilly3737: @lateloll no go look at how many people hit 60 on dp theres stats you can look up
[6:49:49] chasingshadowsz: i dated Samantics i high school
[6:49:51] justskeeting11: 100% casuals
[6:49:52] Kazunya_Meowryu: Hey xar is stonefist still in solo ?
[6:49:53] baldeyx: My grandma would get a lot further in retail wow than HC classic
[6:49:54] macjcool: it feels like the biggest waste of time in my life when i die thoughb
[6:49:56] n8_2k: in ssf can you do dungeons more than once?
[6:49:57] tydyemoon: HC 100% cozy mode wow xD
[6:49:58] Zoismoe: keep flasks of oil for later if ya want :)
[6:50:02] NoktakkVT: @baldeyx to an extent though, you can still be new to the game and hit max level in hardcore fairly easily
[6:50:02] shadowvypers: boar meat is for cooking
[6:50:03] blizzardpolice69: hit with the xar classic
[6:50:03] sighwarlock: if you don't play it casually im sorry
[6:50:10] prescp: if you work a 9-5 getting on and playing hardcore is way easier than getting on with 2 other teammates to push for rank 1
[6:50:11] lateloll: @bigwilly3737 yea but still enough ppl  hit 60 to not make it anything special lol
[6:50:11] logsnar: I don't disagree, however I feel like hardcore is difficult to play casually or not locked in (due to the fact that if you slip up and die, you go again). I can see that being part of the casual fun, to some though.
[6:50:12] Terence99: the thing with hardcore is just at some point it feels like trading your time for very little xp and walking simulation, which isnt really something you want to do casually
[6:50:15] Stormyflames0530: Hardcore wow is definitely casual in the face of end game retail activities
[6:50:17] Kellvig: @Xaryu use talent
[6:50:18] command0mil0: @xaryu different when you’re a streamer though, it’s toxic for life because it interferes with it unless you play super casual which is hard when you’ve been through phases where you’ve played wow hard out for years

[6:50:30] mumbley: true, i know because I am on the spectrum
[6:50:32] Maiqthehighking: Im on that spectrum ive been told
[6:50:32] OgdenTheTavernOwner: its not casual in terms of masochism
[6:50:40] Aka_Gami: You can hit 60 in HC doing nothing but killing stuff 5 levels under you
[6:50:44] Dr0ddy: Does niche = casual?
[6:50:45] n8_2k: in ssf can you do dungeons more than once ?
[6:50:47] Kazunya_Meowryu: Hey xar is stonefist still in solo?
[6:50:49] baldeyx: @NoktakkVT thats not really true. A newbie wowplayer with zero knowledge will always die in HC unless theyre killing green boars
[6:50:52] elkili100: you think SOD is in a weird spot with class balance atm? im a rogue/ casual player and cant get a group for gnomer because of logs and "experience" on s1 bfd was easy to group up
[6:51:00] etrondx: @Xaryu try to invite the mage bots in stockade for free boost xd

[6:51:14] AceOfFlame: plenty haved KEKW
[6:51:23] Lincolnl0g: tru
[6:51:28] Nohez: For me it is exactly the same way. I used to raid mythic and push high m+ on retail, and I felt like I needed to play a lot to stay "on top". But with hc I can log on and off whenever I want and just chill.
[6:51:28] MongoSecurity: Im a 6 second andy :(
[6:51:29] Gorakk82: no its just knowledge and yes endurance
[6:51:30] Stormyflames0530: patience
[6:51:30] Maiqthehighking: it just takes a long time and knowledge

[6:51:35] 0kfatty: @xaryu why not get mutilate? Its so good
[6:51:37] elzamaje: 60 in hardcore is just a challnge of not being stupid.
[6:51:40] Felenden: in before he dies
[6:51:41] Reaperz_kinetic: @baldeyx i disagree with that but thats part of the point... they could log on and just kill one thing at a time aaaaaaaaaaall the way to 60

[6:52:34] baldeyx: @Reaperz_kinetic sure they COULD, but most players have no desire or patience to play that way. And if you are a true noob and you dont know what you dont know, chances are >99% something gets you
[6:52:36] waitimdesyncd: SoD needs a level 1 purple from Hogger for twinking LUL
[6:52:37] OgdenTheTavernOwner: warrior comes with wotlk :D
[6:52:39] Stingin: its like how ppl bash a clip of someone dying at lvl 60 cause they easily could of avoided death, but ppl forget how many things they had to avoid in order to get to where they are at
[6:52:42] DonVitor77: good evening Xar hope you had a great stream until now
[6:52:46] Kazunya_Meowryu: Hey xar is stonefist still in solo? @Xaryu

[6:53:20] Reaperz_kinetic: this is how i play
[6:53:23] elkili100: you think SOD is in a weird spot with class balance atm? im a rogue/ casual player and cant get a group for gnomer because of logs and "experience" on s1 bfd was easy to group up
[6:53:23] chrislu18: How you get your camera zoomed out so far?
[6:53:25] justskeeting11: I see dead people
[6:53:25] fjayve: you should do a hardcore run in 1st person view

[6:53:37] Gorakk82: @xgugga try sod with the exp buff :)
[6:53:37] the1cetea: trying to raid in SoD and be shunt cuz of logs is just making a lot of players stop raiding and playing
