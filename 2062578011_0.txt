[0:39:36] Mooonwarden: but daddy dont you miss it?
[0:39:43] Mooonwarden: !followage
[0:39:48] maddershunt: you should do what i said to echo was to help the normal player get better with guides strats and a better way to come accross to new guild. all i saw was echo flame there helpers for race due to simple mistakes but if they had worked priotr to help they could have had a dedicated farm group
[0:40:11] Mooonwarden: but they need your hunter skills
[0:40:22] GaryNec: @maddershunt OMG GREAT advise
[0:40:25] maddershunt: i know your websight etc i use it alot but needs more a personal booster project
[0:40:38] Mooonwarden: fucking crazy ive been following you since 2013 over 10years
[0:40:45] Boromlr: Do you think you will ever get the likes of RogerBrown back into Method? Maybe its a sensitive topic, excuse me if so. Always like Roger :)
[0:41:09] GaryNec: How do i find other method streamers

[0:43:49] Nicolajbruhn: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:43:52] maddershunt: sco i know you have web sight and the boost runs and the personal training i just mean a way to help dads get better and then also have a a group of people willing to farm splits for you due to the efforts you put in and not just the stupid gold i stopped helping echo due to the attitude in splits
[0:43:56] projektremi: hi sco how are you
[0:44:07] Mooonwarden: its been a few years now, but have you ever talked about the split between method raiders moving to echo ect. like why did all the long time loyal players leave aswell?
[0:44:21] Boromlr: Is it not less worthwhile doing rocket farm after doing it on your main?? I was told they said the first try of the day is a higher chance, and further tries on alts is like 0.10 chance of a drop
[0:44:55] Boromlr: haha fair! :D
[0:45:26] fijicx: you can get my love rocket on valentines day
[0:45:54] Boromlr: Did you get Mrs. Frost some heart shaped method merch Kappa

[0:47:36] Boromlr: Eh Aarhus?
[0:47:39] Mooonwarden: do we know if anything in season 4 for raids
[0:47:48] Altizi: @Sco are you moved to Denmark?
[0:47:52] Boromlr: Aarhus it is south of Copenhagen I think
[0:48:06] SirHamedo3: Roses are red, violets are blue. Without your streams Twitch would be very gray :D
[0:48:18] Nicolajbruhn: When are you moving  to Denmark then? ;)
[0:48:19] Altizi: Where in Denmark are you then?
[0:48:51] Nicolajbruhn: wowowowow
[0:48:54] Boromlr: If I am in Denmark the same time as you, I will say hey to you :D Or Scotland, not sure which is first
[0:49:00] Nicolajbruhn: No reason get personal here
[0:49:01] Altizi: @Boromlr Aarhus is more north of Copenhagen
[0:49:07] Altizi: norhtwest
[0:49:15] Boromlr: @Altizi oops, I did not know :)
[0:49:37] maddershunt: thieland or bust move to na servers
[0:49:41] Altizi: I'm  from a town a bit out for Copenhagen aroudn 15 min centrum of Copenhagen
[0:49:48] Boromlr: But with the high tax rate you get  a lot of things covered right? So, things you'd pay for here in Ireland and Scot, but they're covered through tax in Denmark
[0:49:49] Altizi: of*
[0:50:20] Altizi: yeah
[0:51:08] Boromlr: True, my brother in law works for a Danish company
[0:51:10] NyaPriest: did you ever consider Dubai? they don't seem to have any income tax
[0:51:48] Boromlr: what are the affixes this week by the way? except Tyrannical
[0:52:15] Altizi: Ragning and storming
[0:52:19] SirHamedo3: I don't know what it's like in Scotland, but here in Germany, if you go to the tax office and explain that you are a content creator, many people don't know what to do with it :D
[0:52:24] maddershunt: could we call you shiek sco
[0:52:35] Boromlr: Good week then? raging isnt bad and storm is just inconvenient
[0:53:23] NyaPriest: i was watching one British guy on youtube who moved to Dubai but in order to not pay income tax he had to lose his UK residence. so he's still the UK citizen but he's not a resident and he can't be in the UK for more than 90 days a year or something
[0:53:49] maddershunt: dont the chinese team have like a didicated rich boy fund the gamers for classic need to find one of them
[0:54:15] Boromlr: How long can you spend in EU/Denmark before you become on Global CoolDown :D

[0:59:54] SirHamedo3: I'll be 36 next month and you'll notice how quickly time flies ^^
[1:00:12] NyaPriest: hmm how old does one have to be to call himself a boomer?
[1:00:16] Boromlr: Then we got a guy in my guild who is in his 50s but he looks like he is in mid 20s, and is less stressed than the younger members
[1:00:20] faxiiiii: what does feeling old even mean
[1:00:42] Boromlr: A boomer is someone born in 70s

[1:06:17] Boromlr: Well, it is one people generally tend to miss
