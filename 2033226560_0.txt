[1:40:12] Cobolt_: what key level will the MDI be this season
[1:40:15] moodsen: zaelia
[1:40:24] moodsen: @Cobolt_ no one knows
[1:41:32] cwoomio: @Shred_Flanders why isn't it? sorry, never really followed MDI
[1:41:49] CrownofLust: burning the witches do something extra ? or just damage ?
[1:42:06] Lofigus: MDI is usually a "low" key compared to r1 pushing
[1:42:14] moodsen: @cwoomio the keys are much lower, prolly 22-25 this season
[1:42:33] Cobolt_: falling in reverse is my JAM!!
[1:42:34] moodsen: so the goal isnt really to time the key but be the fastest
[1:42:37] Cobolt_: catJAM
[1:42:43] cwoomio: ahh :D
[1:43:18] Shred_Flanders: There is second competition called TGP = The Great Push which focuses on timing the highest keys possible
[1:43:35] kalegeneral: Man they're unreal
[1:43:37] Shred_Flanders: but that was held last season, this season will be MDI
[1:43:39] Akyran: @Shred_Flanders dont think we get that this season right?
[1:44:21] linkasfd: limit testing live keys is still practice not like you wanna go in blind to tournament realms
[1:44:30] quuqeli: so you can burn those witches?
[1:44:35] quuqeli: did not know that
[1:44:43] Maakanv: @linkasfd Luckly we have the LIMIT TESTER HIMSELF
[1:44:46] MooYah: whats the difference between MDI and TGP?
[1:44:55] moodsen: u can burn all mobs in the courtyard
[1:45:02] philztro: @MooYah Fastest vs highest
[1:45:07] irius__: MDI focuses on speed, TGP focuses on highest keys
[1:45:16] MooYah: ah
[1:45:23] IsaureTV: not all mobs, just the ones in the courtyard
[1:45:25] ZeRaisin: Where is Zaelia?
[1:45:36] StreamElements: Follow my Social Medias! Instagram.com/naowh | Twitter.com/naowhxd | Youtube.com/naowhgaming
[1:45:40] azurehq: @ZeRaisin offline
[1:45:42] linkasfd: @MooYah MDI is set key levels by blizzard and you complete them as fast as possible TGP has no limit other than how high you can push
[1:46:01] Shred_Flanders: @MooYah MDI: set key level, 2 teams compete at a time and faster one wins, TGP: 6 teams push set of 6 dungeons and get score based on key level completed, higher keys win
[1:46:01] MooYah: oh okay makes sense
[1:46:28] azurehq: isnt TGP harder then ?
[1:46:31] MooYah: MDI is a head to head then
[1:46:59] witty95: banger song
[1:47:06] kwlski01: @azurehq its equally as hard because you need to be better than the competition
[1:47:07] linkasfd: @MooYah yep
[1:47:09] moodsen: @azurehq different skill sets
[1:47:13] irius__: @azurehq They are hard in different ways
[1:47:20] Shred_Flanders: @azurehq imo its just different. MDI requires some crazy pulls and consistency to execute well
[1:47:22] epii: @azurehq Is it harder to win a 100m sprint or a 5km run?
[1:47:46] Sandman1903: @azurehq MDI is hard due to how many packs are in a pull but is a low key for these guys TGP is hard as its literally doing world first keys
[1:48:05] azurehq: i mean beeing consistent over 5km is much harder then beeing good for a short time no but i see ur points
[1:48:07] jpeauncockymacaw3: jpeauncockymacaw3 gifted a Tier 1 sub to moz_e! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[1:48:15] erikpotterwow: erikpotterwow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:48:29] philztro: I would rate MDI as harder, as one small fuckup means a restart of the dungeon
[1:48:31] irius__: @azurehq But the 100m run is full of traps and other things that require insane coordination and focus
[1:48:35] linkasfd: TGP is a lot more straightforward play well time the highest keys MDI requires you to be creative and consistent doing crazy stuff
[1:48:52] Sandman1903: also with MDI if you wipe once then you've likely lost that match if you wipe in TGP you can have lots of tries

[1:49:21] azurehq: so we will be more hyped for MDI
[1:49:24] azurehq: thanks lads
[1:49:27] kwlski01: idk how you can ask whats harder, since you literally play against other teams, if its hard is determined by the competition
[1:49:29] cocopowdong: for TGP do u have to time or do u just need to be faster than the other teams
[1:49:36] moodsen: nah more hyped for tgp as a viewer
[1:49:46] Axestro: @moodsen agree
[1:49:47] philztro: haha no, tgp is way better view experience
[1:49:59] JakobLowrizzle: tgp>mdi for sure
[1:49:59] linkasfd: @cocopowdong it's point based but if it's a tie then it's whoever was the fastest
[1:49:59] Shred_Flanders: Watch "Speedrun +21 Atal'Dazar - Wunderbar MDI Finals 2020" on Naowhs YT channel to get a sense what tech is required for MDI. That first pull is probably the best pull I have ever seen
