[1:00:53] DrakeDuude: It will be that much of a change. but RN they are trying to get stuff out their
[1:00:54] DeadlyRabbit_TW: Yeah, it seems odd.  I watched a bunch of the videos now that the NDA has lifted, they changed a bunch but it isn't a new full game. They will need the PVE
[1:01:14] IianaDRK: yeh the pve mode with talent trees got me interested as well
[1:01:26] lithium364: its gonna flop
[1:01:30] Nokterian: idk Overwatch 2 does not have me excited
[1:01:33] Wasabix1: could be on a new engine

[1:02:39] Forrestra: As long as they can get box price for 2 months before settling for DLC prices, they'll be happy.
[1:02:50] StoicTaurus: OW2 It's mostly for under-the-hood freedom of development.  It's like streamer changing his room for bigger. Not much chanes outside but it's lot cleaner and easier to develop updates
[1:02:58] harris243124: Toweliee what did you think of the yankee fans yesterday
[1:03:09] IianaDRK: destiny 2 really fucked up.  they even remove content from the game

[1:04:18] Rottencoarse: @harris243124  oh geez
[1:04:24] aznamir: Overwatch 2 should've been just a big DLC. What's the point of separating 1 and 2 players. And if they are not going to separate them, then why 2 instead of DLC? Makes no sense.
[1:04:30] manmower: you're a blind hunter, you gotta feel around with your staff

[1:05:22] bigoldmeatpie: for the PVP you don't need to get 2. they've already said that all the PVP bits are included if you've bought OW1

[1:06:50] Xcerts: its literally just a big update/rework
[1:06:51] bigoldmeatpie: @Specsifier the PVE part is what you'll pay for. that's also why they've split it up

[1:28:31] robert_332: is this a maghar?
[1:28:34] crizby_89: Ah gotcha makes sense
[1:28:59] IianaDRK: unless a game has 1 million viewers on twitch its a dead game to some people
[1:29:05] Niksen_99: There is like 300k people raiding in TBC alone... WoW must have more players

[1:29:48] Highballz: I never unlocked a lot of the playable races. is rep farming any fast now a days?
[1:30:00] FranciscoTheMage: porous stones are needed now for cauldrons
[1:30:02] PvtHudson093: Not seen that in awhile, just had a small queue to login
[1:30:03] FranciscoTheMage: those sell
[1:30:08] theSalute: d2 music feels so good
[1:30:15] Surpriize: how come your leveling ? nothing else to do ?
[1:30:19] crizby_89: I hated rep farming for my vulpera. Makes me not want to do it again lmao
[1:30:22] fluh_: @FrostyySnapps it's luxthos weakaura leveling bar
[1:30:28] Jellyfiish: Twitch views are a good proxy for game popularity. You just have to ask yourself why the there is no Lost Ark hype on Twitch anymore..

[1:32:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: It's not always that Twitch viewers = players in game....FFXIV has a ton of players but not a lot of viewers on Twitch
[1:32:53] Demonmonger_85: Lets not forget Lost Ark has been out for years
[1:32:57] veeponym: @Jellyfiish false, terraria sold millions, yet little presence on twitch
[1:32:59] Xpress1: its literally the nr1 mmo on twitch atm isnt it?
[1:33:03] DeadlyRabbit_TW: Lost ark is very boring to watch though.
[1:33:13] jridablo: why ppl hating on LA lol if you dont want to play it dont play it the fuq
[1:33:13] Xpress1: oh no
[1:33:16] Xpress1: wow first atm
[1:33:26] Xpress1: its second yeah
[1:33:56] ZetYokai: lost ark is literally 3rd most played game on steam right now
[1:34:05] manmower: does Amazon own the twitch platform though? would expect their numbers to be higher
[1:34:10] Aervyper: @Towelliee new world had about 3 weeks?
[1:34:25] Demonmonger_85: Thats the problem though isn't it @Towelliee ? Views from massive streamers really skew the data? Or is there a way to baseline all that?
[1:34:50] Alienfromger: its a shame still no new content for new world except dungeons
[1:35:00] manmower: people care more about watching the people play than the games themselves

[1:35:30] TakMaggy: HE IS THE DATA
[1:35:34] TakMaggy: Lol
[1:35:39] myguyhood: werent big streamers sponsored to play lost ark? that would skew it probably
[1:35:43] bypized: But also another statistic people have it wrong is the number of people watching NOT ALWAYS represents total number of players  in-game
[1:35:43] veeponym: True, when I want to watch someone a game launch, I go to a specific streamer or content creator
[1:35:46] Nebulizer87: 14 has never had good viewership until Asmon but it's an anomaly cuz 14 servers are always populated af
[1:35:49] robert_332: have not played sv since cata

[1:36:24] Zerfell: ^
[1:36:29] Niksen_99: I thought Lost Ark was popular on twitch because of Asmon guess im wrong LUL
[1:36:30] Loctite: A lot of thinking for a Sunday morning.
[1:36:42] dracullus: in this situation FF people always tell me FF had like 80k views on launch because EVERYONE avoid spoilers xD
[1:36:43] Pyral: Twitch views is the worst metric  to guage by. Geezus
[1:36:49] JoshStrobl: @ijuki This. Nobody should be making their decision on whether or not to play the game based on the streaming community it has.
[1:37:03] Broomba: people are over thinking, or they have a OCD with numbers and metrics which they want something to be true without data and they are lazy to get the real, raw data
[1:37:05] TacticalKabuki: I had no clue about LA and played WoW for years...
[1:37:09] Shadowlemur01: I had no idea what lost ark was. still havent played it, just doesnt look interesting to me
[1:37:22] Demonmonger_85: This is a good conversation imo, because I think content creators are looking at views and not realizing what is behind those views. For some it is content of game, for most I feel we are at a point where it is the streamer and not the game

[1:37:51] veeponym: Some top streamers like soda use the game title of "Barbie House Party" during variety streams, doesn't mean Barbie House Party is one of the most popular games out there
[1:38:10] xaeblue: LA is really good, I just need to find a game with WoW's open world and LA's combat and I'm set
[1:38:13] Niksen_99: Was New World bigger first 3 months ?
[1:38:20] Broomba: @Demonmonger_85 its called click bait all for views and shock and not about content and facts
[1:38:30] ArcaneSyntax: I like playing FFXIV when it has stuff to do, but watching people play it regularly sounds boring af
[1:39:03] fred_birkhoff: i think lost ark broke the record for most people watching an mmo or something
[1:39:07] ditaern: @Pyral Yup, you have games like Civilization that holds top 10-20 on steam daily. But has 0 twitch viewers. Some games are not interesting to watch someone play.
[1:39:13] fred_birkhoff: i remember reading something about a record being broken
[1:39:32] Niksen_99: I dont believe any MMO will ever beat classic wow launch
[1:39:36] Alienfromger: do you expect shut down of new world soon?
[1:39:53] manmower: should have released with LFG, their change in direction late in development was surprising
[1:39:54] Niksen_99: Classic WoW launch gotta be the king of twitch views in MMO
[1:40:03] Nebulizer87: yeah there is nothing to do in that game all the content they added minus one new dungeon has just been modifiers of current content
[1:40:31] manmower: has an MMO ever floundered at initial launch and then flourished later?
[1:40:34] freshlife: WubTF if even amazon can't make a mmo then who the fk can

[1:41:13] Aervyper: i am shocked that Outriders got a DLC, it's crazy that it's 50$ but no less amazing they put it out
[1:41:14] Xetherot: because big guy up there is a big fan of stars.
[1:41:16] veeponym: it's just the game title they use when the variety games they play don't have a working title available in Twitch
[1:41:17] Slytha_KEKW: It is related to reputation as well

[1:51:17] Maytan26: i need that alt catch up
[1:51:28] Xetherot: you would only really need a optimal leveling route in classic if you care about getting to max fast.
[1:51:33] manmower: i like the idea of them releasing smaller bits of content more regularly
[1:51:45] Xetherot: retail doesn't need those guides or pathing anymore.

[1:57:54] manmower: hopefully they do some of those for each dragonflight before the launch
[1:58:41] manmower: those little story vignettes are the best story delivery vehicle they have in the game
[1:58:54] MOLAR305: @Towelliee do you really think that they will make professions as important as they were in Classic, needing the FR for example or getting nightfall for raiding

[2:00:01] manmower: they would need some RNG material drops you hunt for
[2:00:29] Demonmonger_85: IMO they need to have each crafter make at least one META item, and they need to find intricate ways to allow for faster gathering
[2:00:32] Kneckt: Morning chat, morning towel
[2:00:35] akia03: wouldnt prof only be usefull for the start of a xpac and be useless when raids/m+ is there you cant make profs gear beter than pve stuff
[2:00:35] SilkeySmooth: work orders are going to be great i can get some crafted while not being a crafter.
[2:00:39] bypized: @Towelliee when is Blizzard going to allow you to stop the flight requested in mid-flight? Do you see somehting like that ever coming maybe in Dragonflight?
[2:00:42] manmower: using archaeology to get rare recipes/materials would be a good reuse

[2:01:30] bypized: Now the one guy is named Addons
[2:01:30] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee At least Blizz isn't raising their sub prices to $20 a month in the year 2022 right? slootSmug

[2:03:58] mrniceguy817: I didn’t know ppl complained about legion prof quest I actually enjoyed them was unique

[2:06:57] faulen: get ready for Guild Loot!

[2:07:03] FrankTizzle: @Towelliee probably a residuum system like BFA

[2:07:10] headshot_hunter6: good afternoon buddy
[2:07:10] cerealkillas22: They should just give us masterloot and be the end of it

[2:07:18] jerexify: jerexify subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months! Dang, coming up on 3 years already. Nice!
[2:07:31] crittinkitten: Personal loot, but you can reject the drop and it goes to the old need/greed roll?
[2:07:43] akia03: @manmower will never work with pugs tho
[2:07:52] Praetour: Master Loot will be a big thing to bring back but I can see why they avoid it

[2:08:07] IianaDRK: personal loot, but it shows up in a list where people can roll for it psychScared
[2:08:15] manmower: they should make Master Loot locked in when a raid is formed and it should have a pop-up
[2:08:18] Aervyper: @Towelliee does anyone have idea how much wow token money is made by blizzard from the top 10 guilds during it?
[2:08:34] SpoofAvatar: I think that is fine
[2:08:37] Strouss: Makes sense
[2:08:50] SpoofAvatar: that is just loot master in disguise
[2:08:50] manmower: tradeable within the 2 hours
[2:08:51] IianaDRK: tbh tho if theyre going to do that they may as well just bring back master looter
[2:08:57] ZetYokai: thats equivilent to master loot tho, they dont want that
[2:08:58] doomester: then its Master looter again
[2:09:01] doomester: whats changed
[2:09:03] IianaDRK: fully tradable personal loot is just master loot with extra steps
[2:09:12] Demonmonger_85: @Towelliee All personal loot is tradeable to someone that was with you when the kill happened and within 2 hrs
[2:09:18] manmower: you personally get the drop and first dibs
[2:09:23] crittinkitten: @doomester you still have control, so you can refuse to trade
[2:09:27] Zeracho: Only downside (or upside?) is the impliications for the high-end world-first stuff and splits
[2:09:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: I like that idea, just allowing people to trade their personal stuff
[2:09:31] wraaith: at that point they do it willingly
[2:09:32] faulen: make it that way if it's a guild group
[2:09:39] manmower: can't ninja everyone
[2:09:42] mmrghost7: obv that player knows the consequences
[2:09:54] akia03: will people just not loot bosses to get loot in mailbox to not be bothered with the people asking for it
[2:09:58] harrytortilla: in the metaverse you will be able to do that
[2:09:59] ZetYokai: but that will cause alot of upset and likely kicks from guild if people dont trade their loot
[2:09:59] SpoofAvatar: its master looter in disguise
[2:10:00] HilariousMax: Can't they toggle Master Loot so that it effects only like the weeks of RWF since that seems to be what they give a f about?
[2:10:01] DrakeDuude: what is all loot is tradable and able to be sold
[2:10:02] ZetYokai: and people will moan
[2:10:10] KiLLaVuLKeN: i think tradeable personal solves a lot of the ML issues
[2:10:23] mmrghost7: i personally love master loot , cuz i am a tank :D
[2:10:29] ZielonaZelka: The idea of master loot is so toxic omg you would have to give up your look to some random thats bullying
[2:10:33] Sollice: Thats why they have trial members
[2:10:34] crittinkitten: You don't want to be in a guild that will do that then
[2:10:36] Pharaoh_326: i haven't really leveled professions since WoD so I'm excited for that.
[2:10:37] Sollice: You do dumb shit you get booted
[2:10:37] lithium364: @Towelliee but what if the guildmasters new girlfriend takes all the loot Kappa
[2:10:38] Aervyper: @Towelliee i would add one stipulation to that ( Max of 1 or 2 trades) makes it harder to funnel outside of guild)
[2:10:40] assman_ny: Agree @KiLLaVuLKeN
[2:10:43] manmower: standing rule is hunters get first dibs on weapons

[2:11:37] SpoofAvatar: drama will be caused
[2:11:40] ZielonaZelka: @HilariousMax and in m+ or pug somone could take all loot by himself ? like random master looter or smth
[2:11:42] crittinkitten: @Baleroc1 why would you want to be in that guild
[2:11:42] The_DudeDude: yeah they are
[2:11:48] KiLLaVuLKeN: @Baleroc1 then thats not a guild you want to be in, a casual guild has no need to be trading loot and any which make that demand aren't worth your investment for that level of play
[2:11:50] Aervyper: @Towelliee if they did that they would have to CAP N# of trades
[2:12:10] ZetYokai: i fully agree yeah, i just feel that will be WoW team  excuse for not doing it

[2:13:47] IianaDRK: thats 1 thing i like about lost ark. no loot drama
[2:13:58] DrakeDuude: Tank priority is last priority lol
[2:14:01] swordart2022: @Buckwink wut?
[2:14:02] Demonmonger_85: Yup, the point of raid gear is to make the entire raid group better, not just a specific player. It is always about the biggest % improvement for the collective
[2:14:05] nisk___: its not "forced" you agree and apply to join a guild with rules
[2:14:06] Sollice: It's not your loot. Think of it as everyone finding treasure on a boss. You should decide who gets it
[2:14:10] ZetYokai: @IianaDRK but lost ark has no 20 man raids so yeah
[2:14:18] Kavieonn: eh i dont like that, if  you get something you shouldnt be forced to give it to someone else
[2:14:23] IianaDRK: @IianaDRK has 8 player raids
[2:14:25] KingSlayerYotam: Just put master loot at an all guild run, and make it mandatory to agree to it. Disable it in pug groups, so everyone is happy
[2:14:26] nisk___: you arent forced
[2:14:27] swordart2022: @Kavieonn true
[2:14:33] manmower: if loot is tradeable people will be selling drops in the pug runs
[2:14:34] Balkep: even the healer priority is not much of a thing, I would give everything to DPSers first and then get my shit whenever
[2:14:34] xFevers: DPS > healer, tank loot -- Thats ws the RWF guilds do
[2:14:47] Aidler: if everyone agrees in advance that loot is not your loot I guess it’s ok. that’s probably why I don’t raid… because I would never agree to that
[2:14:48] Eluniar: Even if you're trading away loot, if your group is good enough you'll still be geared in no time from the group reclearing quickly and getting 'your turn' faster
[2:14:51] Awwwhoney: h
[2:15:02] mavericks312: @Kavieonn thats fine but when you apply to a guild you know the rules before hand
[2:15:03] SeafrogO: reminds me how I was not suppose to have any 2h sword as pala
[2:15:04] PvtHudson093: raid trinkets have been ass for awhile
[2:15:07] Rossii77: So all the ppl that are hating on it do not realize that they will get the bis Setup given to them, in the same manner as them giving away their loots.
[2:15:08] FrankTizzle: No there aren't
[2:15:14] FrankTizzle: All the caster trinkets in SFO BLOW MAJOR DONG
[2:15:19] nisk___: if you think you are 'forced' to give loot away, make your own raid and guild with your own rules. cos you aint forced champ
[2:15:19] unbreko: i cant play this game
[2:15:19] cerealkillas22: the dps trinkets are pretty dogshit in sepulcher
[2:15:25] unbreko: to much toxic
[2:15:31] Kavieonn: Well im going to join a guild where they dont force you to give your loot to someone else then i guess mavericks312
[2:15:33] xFevers: The group killed the boss do it should be the groups loot not YOUR loot
[2:15:36] cerealkillas22: Trinkets this expansion in this expac have been kinda bleh overall i feel
[2:15:38] SaulMDGaming: I know we are talking trinkets, but that 4pc BrM Tier is absolutely nuts.
[2:15:42] Buckwink: you can tell who the lfr heroes are this morning
[2:15:46] Molvonos: @Aidler If you want to progress effectively, you put gear where it is most effective.  Some classes/players do better with particular upgrades.  You'll get your gear eventually, but you're generally raiding because you enjoy raiding, not *just to get loot*.
[2:15:56] akia03: earthquake trinket is pretty good for dps
[2:16:00] mavericks312: @Kavieonn exactly which means your arent likely to join a top 200 guild then
[2:16:16] ZielonaZelka: I dont get it so ppl want that in some random m+ just 1 random person is a master looter and decidec who gets loot ? He can take it all by himself idk why ppl want this
[2:16:25] Demonmonger_85: Honestly, if they just improve the gearing process from max level to raiding and I will be happy. I ran like 22 straight mythics when they opened and did not get one upgrade.
[2:16:26] SpoofAvatar: get the fated one when it comes out next patch, it will be higher ilvl
[2:16:28] manmower: that's cool, kept the old content worthwhile
[2:16:30] FrankTizzle: @ZielonaZelka This is my concern
[2:16:36] FrankTizzle: Master Looter will be abused by Streamers
[2:16:37] crittinkitten: @ZielonaZelka No one is asking for that
[2:16:40] nisk___: M+ doesnt work like that
[2:16:42] dkgodsteed: Same, im rerunning heroic sylv for ows
[2:16:50] Aidler: @molvonos guess that’s right but as I said … that’s why I don’t raid…
[2:16:52] rathmoon: How many hours /played for 1-60 you think for your 9-5 run
[2:16:52] newkingcody: next tier
[2:17:09] Kavieonn: @mavericks312 Many of us have a life and arent playing this game professionally so that doesn't matter to me @mavericks312
[2:17:14] wikiwa1: I think most CE guilds understand that it's probably better to distribute gear where it's most effective. Doubt anyone there feels forced to do anything.
[2:17:24] Wcvechten: Can't wait to get Fatescribe trinket at an even higher ilvl if it stays like this
[2:17:26] nisk___: most people will have CE jalier cos DF is prob q7 2027 !
[2:17:30] KiLLaVuLKeN: think a lot of chat is doing normal/late content heroic thinking that they would be forced to trade loot.. if that is happening you're in the wrong guild, this should only be impacting higher end guilds .. if a casual guild is making you trade then the system has helped you filter out an awful leadership, you dodged a bullet
[2:17:33] ZielonaZelka: @ebonhawkes so for what ?
[2:18:01] Malnar1123: Flying is the big one.
[2:18:10] DenizUK: guys when does new expansion come out?
[2:18:18] Buckwink: @Kavieonn and by "have a life" you mean you work too much for too little to play on your off time
[2:18:25] nisk___: next year @DenizSeason
[2:18:48] Malnar1123: Hellfire Peninsula with flying is just insane quest density.
[2:18:54] DenizUK: @ishamael85 ty
[2:18:54] manmower: i think the loot distribution is probably lower on priorities than some of the bigger stuff WoW is working
[2:18:55] crittinkitten: @ZielonaZelka It'd be nice for guild raid runs. Or split runs. No one wants to "trick" anyone into giving up thier gear. But an option to allow people to agree to funnel gear into the most needed/agreed upon people would just be nice. It would reduce some friction,

[2:19:14] Molvonos: @hizzlee shhhh.
[2:19:24] Kavieonn: @Buckwink Nothing to do with work, it means i have other hobbies and i like to hang out with my friends and family instead of playing wow 24/7 so being in a top 200 guild does not matter to me. I'm not playing this game professionally
[2:19:32] newkingcody: krexus was an underused character
[2:19:32] ZielonaZelka: @ebonhawkes cant ppl in the same instance trade loot within 2 hts ?
[2:19:36] Snabido: Krexus got done dirty yo
[2:19:37] Xeeshki: how do u get flying as a new player in all the other zones? do u have to do all achievements for each add on or once u hit 60 u just can fly in all other zones?
[2:19:45] nisk___: flying mounts enhanced wow, then the devs decided to not use them correctly after Wrath
[2:19:53] Strouss: im not a Necro fan but Draka was bad ass
[2:19:55] Buckwink: @Kavieonn then stop crying about things that dont concern you
[2:20:04] Wcvechten: Krexus had such a cool model aswell, and we didn't even see him fight once, so dumb
[2:20:08] Kisswani: I loved Draka's and Thrall interaction in the Korthia Campaign
[2:20:10] Pharaoh_326: the jailor was not participating this whole xpac
[2:20:16] manmower: ground mounts should move faster than flying mounts, flying should be for elevation

[2:21:48] manmower: i think with flying in mind they're making much larger zones in dragonflight
[2:21:51] Strouss: i think they should make all currency server account wide.
[2:21:52] Rottencoarse: drop the hammer on the troll pls
[2:21:52] roseclawz: PASS

[2:24:40] Velashen: 10.3 Kappa
[2:24:54] newkingcody: 10.3.5
[2:24:56] Kisswani: I assume by account wide rep you mean that reawards unlock for every1 of your characters when you hit exalted or revered , not that rep gains sort of funnel ?
[2:24:57] reggiepowa: what do you even get from reputation now that needs to be accaunt wide and its not already
[2:24:57] Malnar1123: Rep is the big one....with other systems gone it should be the only major thing left.
[2:25:06] Robodope: just feels like it'd be less dev work to make reps account-wide than design unique catch-up mechanics every patch
[2:25:23] Kisswani: @reggiepowa Inifinte rune
[2:25:33] newkingcody: account wide reps =alt friendly game
[2:25:33] CrusaderNero: ppl are to obsessed with gear :)
[2:25:34] reggiepowa: @Kisswani woow, big deal
[2:25:35] manmower: want them to stick to some systems and iterate, so they can spend more time on content
[2:25:35] Demonmonger_85: @Towelliee If more things in the past were account wide and if expansion content didn't just disappear each xpac, I never would quit. Not sure how many share that sentiment?
[2:25:40] KingSlayerYotam: Blizz not playing the game? nothing new sadly
[2:25:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: #OnceIsEnough lol don't make us regrind
[2:25:43] Molehj: "I can hear Jimmy!"

[2:25:50] MILESkg21: White Men KEKW
[2:25:57] Molehj: What a film
[2:26:07] CrusaderNero: all I want is account wide feature for retail. I love swapping classes.
[2:26:22] reggiepowa: @Kisswani thats like the only thing and considering runes are like 50g now it doesnt even matter if you have infinite one or not
[2:26:24] Orion280: yeah i am pleasently surprised
[2:26:38] mozavich: bro i remember getting exalted with argent tournament then transferring to horde and losing all my rep. i was so pissed lol. eventually they changed it so your rep follows but back then it didn't. had to regrind that. wouldn't wish that on anyone.
[2:26:41] manmower: do you think we'll get a reworked system like Torghast? could call it Dragon Tower
[2:26:54] Orion280: i really like they went with talents and making your class itself stronger
[2:26:55] Slap_Of_Cthulhu: I played 9.0 and 9.1 is there a worth to comeback now before Dragonflight or should I wait like a month before expan go out?
[2:27:00] CrusaderNero: I wouldnt have minded a renown feature again either. With cool rewards on the way. Nothing you gotta farm for player power
[2:27:13] raye_gaming22: na im good i did my share of maw of souls and islands im fine without it
[2:27:23] Robodope: i thought there is (cosmetic) renown in dragonflight
[2:27:23] Dagomarus: i think it was going to have the covenant system but at the last minute chose not to like if you at the launcher the dragonflight graphic says "Harness the Power" ... harness what power... its just talents bro
[2:27:43] Orion280: @CrusaderNero they have that in dragonflight
[2:27:54] JoshStrobl: @Slap_Of_Cthulhu Dragonflight isn't going to be until 2023 so I would just come back whenever you feel it.
[2:27:56] StraightErro: carry it to the pool
[2:27:57] AzizianQ: 1by1 LUL
[2:27:58] CrusaderNero: @Orion280 cool!
[2:28:00] Kisswani: @CrusaderNero Same here , just let us have the rewards with the renown as well . I hated that some renown levels unlocked a vendor item you gotta farm anima for
[2:28:01] RulerJ2012: it's the things you just picked up
[2:28:02] Malnar1123: @Baleroc1 Honestly I don't even see why this is necessary. It's just adding an unnecessary step. Just grant it to every character...it's like now with the Renown lvl 40 token...why do I have to to run to that vendor for each covenant and spend a trivial amount of gold. It's just hiding it from players that maybe haven't been told about it
[2:28:02] manmower: they can just give you a dragonflight power on your talent bar
[2:28:03] StraightErro: only carry one at a time
[2:28:16] nephttv_: morning

[2:29:22] SpoofAvatar: I agree with reps, but not the dragon. that should be per character so you can individualize them

[2:29:23] AzizianQ: nah its too early

[2:30:16] Kisswani: @GDmonger you can individulize them even if account wide . I think the point is that if you farmed an appearance on 1 character you shouldn't farm it again and again

[2:32:18] xhaven: nope
[2:32:18] Velashen: Masteries yes.
[2:32:19] Metallical: I would like to see, instead of player housing, an "account tavern" that replaces the character select screen. This tavern would be all the characters you have, hanging out. Could have trophies you could unlock decorating it, but it's main purpose would be like the legacy system of SWTOR, where your characters share things through the tavern.
[2:32:21] MeisterPetze: you can buy that shit
[2:32:23] nisk___: copying and improving is what Blizz do best
[2:32:25] dust_042: ofc it has so many masteries

[2:55:20] Demonmonger_85: @Towelliee Why did they get rid of the Valor and Justice system in the past? It was a really solid way to gear when RNG was not on your side
[2:55:41] king_julian_96: oh isee    woudl ti be fine to get mount still if i did it on heroic

[2:57:11] ArcaneSyntax: I think they said they got rid of it because people were playing for badges instead of boss drops.

[3:00:16] Maruika: all gear account wide
[3:00:17] LeXieSterling: Don't I wish gold was account wide.
[3:00:17] IianaDRK: having gold account wide in lost ark is very useful
[3:00:18] Xugodx2012: no real reason should not be server wise
[3:00:20] SiXKiNG_: I understand if things have to be limited to server wide
[3:00:21] Yetik: isnt gold already acount wide with the mail ?
[3:00:23] dreamwalker213: For it doesn’t even have to be fully account wide. Just do the boa boxes like they do for ash and cinders. At least I can still share it at the end of the day
[3:00:23] JoshStrobl: IMO all the currency types should be account wide.
[3:00:24] NILLme: funny that most of the crafting mats/gold in diablo 3 are account wide since day 1 :D
[3:00:28] Perstriction: i like shared banking
[3:00:35] manmower: they need a reason for people to want to play on alts
[3:00:37] SensationalBanana: @taobender777 @taobender777 What groupthink is that, exactly?
[3:00:38] TweakT: I like g00ooOlde
[3:00:41] warrenny: @yetik Basicallly
[3:00:49] ArcaneSyntax: imagine getting items and using void storage for account wide storage of items? oh i got this useless 260 trinket and I can now use it on my alts.
[3:00:56] chiefiskeith: we can rebuild him, we have the technology
[3:00:59] bypized: @Towelliee do you think its because of "lore" purposes that they dont do some of those changes?
[3:01:03] Yetik: @warrenny yeah its just not very convinient hehe
[3:01:06] Crunchroll0630: Towellie=Big Brain
[3:01:12] stallowned: @Yetik yea but its limited to server wide
[3:01:18] mmrghost7: make all gear accountwide , DO IT
[3:01:25] Zendero89: i wish the relics was BoA...
[3:01:29] Zendero89: the sandworn
[3:01:31] bekindtoeachothr: it would really motivate me to play.  I resubbed but I get discouraged looking at my many alts that i want leveled
[3:01:36] Yetik: @stallowned ohhh i didnt know that
[3:01:37] manmower: make the relics BOE
[3:01:50] faulen: the relics vendor should sell more shit too

[3:02:01] pk99: I can't go through another alt-unfriendly xpack after playing Lost Ark NotLikeThis
[3:02:01] Xugodx2012: For M+ score if they want to compromise they could give accelerated m+io til you read your io on your hightest toon
[3:02:01] KingSlayerYotam: I have 900 relics on my 260 dh just sitting there
[3:02:06] ArcaneSyntax: genesis motes are already account wide I don't know why relics arent
[3:02:20] Xugodx2012: reach*
[3:02:22] papascruge: the relic gear should be able to be used at the creation catalyst too
[3:02:24] MrGattz: all these "Glimmer of *** " things that we get should be in a currency tab as well.. theres no reason to have 15 different items for crafting one off stuff thats just clogging up bags
[3:02:57] ArcaneSyntax: I think Raider Io should be character specific, but the rewards tied to it account wide

[3:03:21] theDirtyon3: its ap all over again
[3:03:29] NILLme: thats a joke LUL
[3:03:29] Xugodx2012: @ArcaneSyntax They just tie it to achievement instead of actual score
[3:03:30] manmower: nah, bigger bags is the solution for Blizzard
[3:03:36] MILESkg21: typical blizz KEKW
[3:03:45] theDirtyon3: remember when ap was in your bags in legion? KEKW
[3:03:51] mavericks312: they know ppl will buy them due to it containing raid mats for the mounts
[3:03:52] king_julian_96: yeah espcially consdierign you need around 400 per mount to create
[3:04:02] Hitokiri83: same as the daily forge like 25motes
[3:04:07] Snabido: 50% tho init?
[3:04:12] Xugodx2012: I want an extra bag slot or two in my bank tbh
[3:04:16] MrGattz: we NEED 100 slot bags at this point. legit. either blizzard needs to move everything to an account faction wide currency tab or we need 100 slot bags.
[3:04:19] MrGattz: end of story
[3:04:20] Delacrois: 200% increase
[3:04:21] manmower: they need some sort of shared accountwide progress system
[3:04:25] NILLme: its insane if you want to craft all pets and mounts..
[3:04:29] Nightshaft25: !AlphaSniffies
[3:04:38] MILESkg21: REMOVE THE SACK SwiftRage
[3:04:39] king_julian_96: not to mention the mounts to create toweliee
[3:04:43] daniel85mg: more pets = mobile Wowkemon inc
[3:04:54] king_julian_96: there is alot and they cost about 400 per one
[3:04:58] taobender777: True… I want to gear up my druid, but it just seems too daunting to even start
[3:05:18] NILLme: it still takes like 30min for 200-300
[3:05:24] Armdel: i read you can farm up to 800 an hour
[3:05:30] Xugodx2012: You are in a way penalized for playing for years bag slot wise since artifacts heart of azeroth etc cannot be destroyed
[3:05:52] Aidler: I believe someone said you need around 9500 mots for all pets and mounts
[3:05:55] reggiepowa: and you still need crafting material which is low % to drop from rares. so we have both low drop rates and farming currency
[3:05:58] Cirosh: you have to do the q though - in order to get them
[3:06:03] bekindtoeachothr: lol
[3:06:04] DeadlyRabbit_TW: You mean like GW2?
[3:06:07] LeXieSterling: Everything yes Everything ....
[3:06:08] lirly__: 25 genesis motes for a vault token is an insult tbh
[3:06:10] kyr_slowbro: AMEN !!!!!
[3:06:13] NickLeonhearth: when you start saying "at least you can do etc etc etc" it doesn't look good
[3:06:13] manmower: accessibility you say? adding some handicap spots to the flightpoints in org
[3:06:14] ThisIzD: a lot of people think its because of "played time metrics" but i honestly think its more they are scared to change a lot of the "old days" stuff and piss off a bunch of players when in reality most people are good with account wide stuff imo.
[3:06:15] Virus2508: that would be dope
[3:06:22] LeXieSterling: 10% is a start
[3:06:23] HopeThePriest: It doesnt hurt the game to open up BoA, at all.
[3:06:25] Virus2508: but blizz is still too stuck up imo
[3:06:25] mavericks312: 10% is better then 0
[3:06:25] Xugodx2012: I would love it if we could put our artifact level gear in void storage to save space @Towelliee
[3:06:33] StrawHatLuffy7: i'll take 10%
[3:06:37] king_julian_96: what about alpha toweliee when do you think alpha for dragonflight will be
[3:06:37] Virus2508: YEP
[3:06:49] manmower: i think they have that old grind mindset from the early MMOs
[3:06:59] mavericks312: i mean john hight that is why
[3:07:00] MILESkg21: they have to see the trends
[3:07:01] bekindtoeachothr: they can never go 100% into an idea its alwyas scaled back
[3:07:03] BriscoGDP: it turns into a part time job at that point
[3:07:13] Slytha_KEKW: we need incentives, not barriers
[3:07:13] bypized: @Towelliee I think they are attached to lore reasons too much, that your character is THE CHAMPION
[3:07:18] MisterBongwater: When Ion talks about system friction, I’d hope  they’re seriously considering more account wide stuff
[3:07:19] FluxistTV: account wide systems = play alts MORE cuz you actualy play the fun content instead of catching up
[3:07:24] akelatales: I agree totally and finally someone says it !!!
[3:07:27] fewyn: that's what i liked about wod i could play every single alt
[3:07:30] MrGattz: look at the games bag system. if you dont have an addon for it its not even usable. hit B and it opens 5 separate bags. talk about dinosauric.
[3:07:50] Virus2508: this is the quintessence of what we have been saying for a long time now: RESPECT OUR TIME

[3:09:03] MrGattz: @Commander_Eggi i mean sure. but like you cant tell me its not the same exact system that we had in literally vanilla. its a 20 year old system that needs some love
[3:09:03] Merkuriuz: no.

[3:09:12] Waiden01: I would not play alts in WoW, after playing games like FFXIV, LA, never

[3:09:17] Alllprimer: SeemsGood towHAMUP

[3:09:23] bypized: Yes, I want my alt to be the gold making one
[3:09:24] Anexros: totally agree, renown is a big bug bear for me on alts, should be account wide renown imo
[3:09:26] aznamir: After playing Lost Ark, alts in WoW feel just terrible
[3:09:29] Mikromanagement: yes playing my alt makes me frustrated to the point where i just end up giving up on playing them @Towelliee
[3:09:29] ground4isu: Yes! Current setup makes me not even want to play them knowing the work ill have to put into them which is a repeat of what i did on my main.
[3:09:30] titansteef: Im not even playing alts, since i work a lot and dont wanna waste on alts i cant progress in a lot of ways
[3:09:33] bekindtoeachothr: LIke im being forced to be miserable to get to what i enjoy
[3:09:33] Bl4ckSauce: yeah catching up has always been a nightmare lol
[3:09:35] Crunchroll0630: Yes. I don’t play alts right now because of that
[3:09:42] Sufix: and its really annoying as a person that get easily bored of a "main"
[3:09:43] EKS90_: @MrGattz yeah i still agree on that point 100%. you can like it but it needs love and updates.
[3:09:43] shimwood: I'm not even having fun on my main. y'all nerfed Boomkin to the ground
[3:09:44] Aervyper: @Towelliee heresey someone has been playing Lost ark to much get the stake i'll get a torch
[3:09:44] ribose1982: If everything is shared, why have alts? Why not just have 1 char that can change into any class when they want?
[3:09:51] taobender777: Very true…. For years WoW seemed rewarding….. since WoD though many innovations seem punishing and anti-fun
[3:09:51] king_julian_96: what about alpha towelliee when do you think alpha for dragonflight will be
[3:09:52] sakura_2020: i still cannot believe torghast tower knowledge still isn't account wide
[3:09:55] ogipk: I took a break and want to play a different character, but since i skipped a lot of 9.1 I feel like I cant even play and might as well wait until 10.0
[3:10:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't want to spend 100K for a legendary for every single alt

[3:10:21] CrusaderNero: I want to play my mage/lock, but I cant be bothered farming the legendaries and all that :|
[3:10:27] manmower: we have unique race/class combos and racial abilities/identity
[3:10:29] Bl4ckSauce: @Armdel exactly

[3:10:38] MrKhanes: I have played the same main, sence vanilla my paladin except in TBC when i was playing shaman, but i have never changed main because of stuff are not account wide.
[3:10:39] manmower: any item you buy from a rep vendor should be BOA
[3:10:39] KVANNORWICK: Guild Wars 2 does account wide stuff exceptionally well.
[3:10:45] ogipk: Rep content gating

[3:12:07] bypized: Make WoW VR CHAT
[3:12:16] ogipk: Conduits and the cost of Legendary makes me not able to play alts at all as a casual player
[3:12:17] trashedskeletor: you do

[3:12:39] DrkPhoenix6913: i just flat gave up on alts 2 expansions ago :P

[3:13:13] CrusaderNero: I logged my DK last week and game wanted to send me to korhia first. I logged off
[3:13:15] Malnar1123: @bypized Same as now...Chromie time 1-60...shadowlands will become an option
[3:13:21] Mitune: I mean a true new player may not even know about torghast

[3:15:30] itsEllySaurus: yeah
[3:15:33] CrusaderNero: whole of SL story is going to look so weird and bad in 2 years.
[3:15:33] ScurvyHyam: Nope, but it kinda makes sense
[3:15:41] phantom1353: its similar, it has more bass to it in the dragonflight cinematic.
[3:15:42] Etherdon: have they said anything about Chromie Time changes? Specifically so it doesnt yank us from the world at 50?
[3:15:42] Fensmarken: Doesnt it sound like the soul engine?
[3:15:42] daega_music: its like the bell from Hells Bells & for Whom the bell tolsls
[3:15:44] Broomba: welp if its on reddit it has to be true KEKW
[3:15:44] sotsil_: that event could have been the trigger though
[3:15:44] Robodope: could be when the sword hits azeroth
[3:15:44] N3llee: I mean it would be a different sound being under ground as apposed to above
[3:15:44] Snabido: More like the azerite jailer took come back and woke her up
[3:15:46] phantom1353: but it s actually quite similar.
[3:15:49] bypized: So Blizzard brought Mitch Jones back @Towelliee ?
[3:15:57] Gibsonex937: This guy trying to make shadowlands somewhat relevant lol
[3:15:59] mackieftw: jailer 2.0 KEKW

[3:17:48] squarepusher_: in before we discover that we only beat the jailer because of something the dragon aspects did on the literal other side of azeroth.
[3:17:50] mavericks312: only reasonable race would be tuskarr
[3:17:51] dracullus: there is something encrypted in tirisfal

[3:44:01] icerasta: no you have to open it and then do the korthia vendor to send to alts
[3:44:03] Roobi_doobi: so much flux
[3:44:04] bekindtoeachothr: i stoped wow pretty early into shadowlands...coming back trying to figure out what to do

[3:45:43] Praetour: The Reputation is the worst part of pathfinder
[3:45:43] CrusaderNero: I'd rather lvl a character on classic without gear or weapon
[3:45:45] VerdeSol3: Sure but I never played this game....
[3:45:45] Praetour: Remove that its fine
[3:45:45] responsiv: i mean putting flying behind any amount of quests is stupid afg
[3:45:47] MILESkg21: Pathfinder was great in WOD but shit afterwards
[3:45:52] Chum964: unpopular opinion but I liked pathfinders
[3:45:52] niebvelungen: pathfinder was huge shit

[3:47:08] CrusaderNero: your dragon has 5% fly speed at the beginning KEKW
[3:47:09] Pharaoh_326: how to train your dragon
[3:47:13] Cirosh: ion said you are able to use your flying mounts
[3:47:18] bypized: Idk how much I like that, its basically making my other mounts stale
[3:47:21] Cirosh: ...later on of course
[3:47:27] Armdel: mandatory system grind Kappa
[3:47:30] JumpTroopC5: It adds flavor.
[3:47:39] VerdeSol3: This is a a gaint bat mount?
[3:47:44] SilkeySmooth: id like them to not allow xmogs the same way as they dont allow flying for the emersio
[3:47:46] Prideinlife: flight masters whistle should make a return. if we at least get that it wont be bad to not have flying
[3:47:56] VerdeSol3: Don't blame him
[3:47:56] Gluwc: depends what the flavour is Kappa
[3:48:03] Troniin: I wonder if crusader aura will make it go faster
[3:48:09] manmower: so dragon probably timegated to slowly open up new areas to move to
[3:48:12] Armdel: atleast there's no player power tied to it, just makes it easier to get around the zone i guess
[3:48:20] JumpTroopC5: If it’s wrapped into the lore I am ok with it
[3:48:28] Whytepap3r: The olllllll rune twist

[3:48:52] TheKitsuneAdventures: @Towelliee whats your fsavourite  hunter pet
[3:48:55] jmalmin: Must admit the dragon flying ithing is the only thing that does not interested me in Dragonflight. If that is the end game grind.... well there is always something else to play alongside wow :D

[3:55:58] Qoax: You can do that already
[3:55:58] Nexecutioner: @towelliee Was the thing you were excited for in WotLK announced, and if so what was it?
[3:56:15] Snabido: Consumes less
[3:56:17] Manabucho: no
[3:56:18] Snabido: I think
[3:56:19] Mourningztar: I dont even understand why they removed it
[3:56:22] Snabido: For same value
[3:56:22] skorchhx: it consumes rested xp slower
[3:56:22] happybooger: your rest drains slower
[3:56:23] Chum964: just get the loot boomerang and you zoomin
[3:56:23] tronbadgames: @Towelliee no it makes it consume it less
[3:56:26] ScurvyHyam: No, its a passive XP bonus
[3:56:31] will_ggez: gold maybe. definitely not trash items lol
[3:56:34] itsTwigs_: I feel like I wasted all my time and money grinding looms now theyre shit....not fair
[3:56:38] greyxdayy: haven't watched you since legion bc i quit wow and i just started to play this again, the nostalgia HITTIN
[3:56:43] CodyKane: @Towelliee Can you ask blizz to make a feature that allows us to have hot dog fingers!
[3:57:00] tronbadgames: @Towelliee basically, when you have rested xp, it's a certain amount. heirlooms make it last longer
[3:57:09] Youredoneson666: I don't even use them anymore because they aren't worth it.
[3:57:23] Noshpan: Same. I don't use them anymore either
[3:57:27] Vendralos: Imagine making Heirlooms fun
[3:57:28] CYNIC308: they should have refunded the gold + inflation since they're worthless now LUL
[3:57:30] Praetour: The heirloom explosion is the stupidest thing, most levels are in towns handing in quests
[3:57:41] SidecarShrimp: @Towelliee why are you leveling a new char?
[3:57:42] ArcaneSyntax: I feel like they wanted to deemphasize heirloom gear to make it feel less mandatory for leveling alts.
[3:57:44] CrusaderNero: no one does. we just pay for a boost KEKW
[3:57:47] LightBladeStream: Movement speed?
[3:57:49] manmower: they should have a BG mode that is corruptions
[3:58:00] Mourningztar: agreed
[3:58:01] manmower: and anima powers
[3:58:04] Vendralos: Remember blasting dungeons at low level with looms in WotLK?
[3:58:04] Gingerprimer: @ArcaneSyntax same
[3:58:05] tronbadgames: the level up thing is only good for like 1-10
[3:58:07] astral_kingdom: i like the ooc regen
[3:58:11] Coriollis: they could experiment with tons of stuff with leeling gear but they almost never do, the last interesting heirloom was the ring from missions in wod
[3:58:13] Arocian: yeah, heirlooms is not very useful now
[3:58:14] greyxdayy: wait they did what to heirlooms now?
[3:58:19] shortyforthewin: btw why cant you move a character from normal wow too classic
[3:58:32] KShellZx: i liked being rewarded with extra xp for alts by grinding for heirlooms
[3:58:45] Youredoneson666: @shortyforthewin why would you be able to? lmao
[3:58:52] Demonmonger_85: @Towelliee Just let our alts get the heirloom buff if we have a max level in that xpac. No requirement for the gear, just get the bonus after reaching max level with a single character
[3:58:52] SensationalBanana: i prefer the current iteration
[3:58:55] BeatTheDevilOut: I mean I get both sides. Leveling in classic is fun but you're right that leveling in retail is completely irrelevant so getting through it is good
[3:59:13] AinaTan3: The people who desgined this don't even play the game
[3:59:15] Snabido: Tier set LUL
[3:59:16] MILESkg21: KEKW
[3:59:17] Pacificooler: Lots of wasted bursts by quest turn ins
[3:59:21] Gingerprimer: It should be you get stats that ramps up when you kill stuff
[3:59:22] Mitune: yeah the 5 set should be an on hit chance thing with the 40% agility going some where else
[3:59:23] PyroGambler: or by just turning in a quest
[3:59:32] Niksen_99: Last time i used heirloom it was extra xp for everything LUL
[3:59:37] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: FUN DETECTED

[4:00:06] JustMible: don't you dare cohhSus
[4:00:07] LtDanz_NewLegs: the emotional damage soundbite is possibly my favorite ever
[4:00:13] Mourningztar: They are just trying to force store boosts
[4:00:13] Pacificooler: Even making the burst of damage a one time use extra action button you can use when you want would make it better
[4:00:16] KShellZx: honestly i don't use the heirloom mount leveling alts because i hate how it sounds
[4:00:19] Noshpan: It's because a group of people complained about heirlooms making their characters out-level a zone before they've done all the quests in a zone
[4:00:25] KingSlayerYotam: DesMephisto said its more effective *not playing* to acquire rested exp with heirlooms
[4:00:32] ThePawPaw: yeah remove it gime me 1mil gold back :}
[4:00:35] Vendralos: Holy shit, true
[4:00:41] Slytha_KEKW: blizzard logic: lets make a gold sink, nah dont need it to make sense
[4:00:45] MisterBongwater: When everything is built to accommodate natural gear rewards, heirlooms as they are now just seem superfluous.
[4:00:47] Coriollis: my guess is they were made for level dungeon spam which was the ideal way before they they redid new starting zone and redid xp gains in the world

[4:03:52] jkitchin75: towStop towIt
[4:03:52] N3llee: wotlk is going to be insane. Its going to bring massive players abck
[4:03:54] hatsihansu: @LightBladeStream The dungeons are useless in wrath mate
[4:03:54] brentosxd: just implement the retail group finder its just the better version
[4:03:56] mavericks312: meant if it isnt in at launch it will tank
[4:03:58] MILESkg21: put it back in and instantly 20 mil subs
[4:04:00] TacDuc: Even if LFG isn't there the subs will definitely go up
[4:04:00] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: get it outta here
[4:04:04] Jokervenom1978: Im a wrath baby and i want group finder.
[4:04:05] hatsihansu: @LightBladeStream even without the lfd
[4:04:05] Mitune: Yeah people really wont like making groups especially later when Heroic dungeons are going to take less time than finding a group
[4:04:06] Gingerprimer: @Towelliee they have even spoken about restrcintg dual spec
[4:04:11] Youredoneson666: most private servers you can que for mythic dungeons in the LFG tool, i want that in retail
[4:04:12] Zyxst_: lfd should be in wrath, small servers will suffer and blizzard doesnt merge servers so. also teh 2 tokens you get from it, I guess they can make a daily for those?
[4:04:16] KingSlayerYotam: Blizzard really needs to stop with the holding back mentality, it kills the game.
[4:04:16] JustMible: LFG is a huge convenience, if you don't like it don't use it. So simple
[4:04:22] Hundicasm: I'm out of the loop, why don't blizz/people like LFG?

[4:05:12] Praetour: If Warmane is anything to go off, make a carbon copy of wrath as it was and you'll have a healthy playerbase subbing for the next 20 years
[4:05:13] Triist0ne: i mean i'd rather not have the lfg and instead have the group finder system that retail has for m+ now
[4:05:18] Eluniar: Either way it'll make some people happy and some upset no matter whether they keep it or not
[4:05:18] Syprus1: its by design they no the community doesnt want that they just want to be able to say they listened to the community
[4:05:24] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: #NoChanges they didn't have lfg at launch of wotlk

[4:05:47] Vendralos: and badge gear
[4:05:51] Praetour: HOW WILL WE GET PERKY PUG
[4:05:52] Thunderbrew: I won't play Wrath without Looking for Group. I can't grind another Classic/TBC...
[4:05:54] Silverwards: I think Ion's banking on people playing Dragonflight for that XD

[4:05:55] Coriollis: that was at toc

[4:06:13] monute316: well he did speak up fast as f about how its still on live and will be in dragon flight lol
[4:06:14] Goosemantm: I like the idea from an experiment standpoint. "What if Wrath was more like TBC and Vanilla" rather than the more  accessible version.
[4:06:18] DocHarp: ive been irritating hearing other streamers discuss how "it isnt hard to get groups" or "use the LFG addon", those are not sufficient answers to why its good to remove dungeon finder
[4:06:18] Aypex01: the thing is, people who'd rather not use the dungeonfinder are  more than welcome not to..
[4:06:29] Syprus1: THey know the community wants LFG. haha its their way of taking advantage of the community wants LFG ok we will listen!!
[4:06:32] Truthseeker96: The thing is, ppl are tired or running to dungeons all day long. Being in city in a LFD q is quality of life. We still do all the content just without running from place to place
[4:06:40] Prideinlife: people think removing LFG will make it feel like the early 2000s gaming again, times have changed you can remove lfg but gaming has changed
[4:06:43] Truthseeker96: of*
[4:06:43] MILESkg21: sure when your viewerbase is like 50k KEKW
[4:07:11] Shrubs: i think it could be interesting, at least worth a try
[4:07:12] Aypex01: @truthseeker96 exactly. and anyone whod rather not use it, can just avoid it.
[4:07:15] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: I can look for a group in game chat, like it was back then
[4:07:23] knife_tv: ur gonna go for 3k io on brewmaster?
[4:07:26] MerffTV: I'd like to see a retail-style group finder in Wrath Classic. Not automatic, but very useful.
[4:07:29] TacDuc: Using the power of LFG we can
[4:07:39] knife_tv: lets go
[4:07:39] Truthseeker96: @Aypex01 smaller servers are gonna need LFD or they will simply burn out or just quit
[4:07:40] Gingerprimer: @MerffTV they will have that
[4:07:49] papascruge: the stuff that kills me is the people saying "remove lfg" use the "lfg addon"
[4:07:50] knife_tv: brewmaster so underrated in keys imo
[4:07:53] Thunderbrew: If I have two hours to play I probably can't run a dungeon, especially if I'm a DPS.
[4:07:53] LightBladeStream: We literally solved this in Legion, the LFG tool. LFD sucked the life out of dungeons
[4:07:56] EvoThis: And thats were the fans divert to other games... Just cant do end game content and its a dead game at that point

[4:08:17] DovahChicken: LFG Bulletinboard
[4:08:19] N3llee: bulletin board kinda thing
[4:08:22] AinaTan3: love big streamers who get free stuff in game asking for blizz to get rid of LFR KEKW
[4:08:27] TheItalianStallion321: its an LFG bulletin, all it does is reads LFG channel
[4:08:29] MerffTV: its pretty terrible, just use the retail version
[4:08:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: People having to make add-ons for finding groups is ridiculous
[4:08:34] misterwinoe: use addon..or hear me out...have it in game
[4:08:34] SilkeySmooth: whats the point of lfg addon vs lfd to satify peopels egos?
[4:08:37] Mitune: My HOPIUM is that Shamans get some talents in Dragonflight to let them tank like reg mythic dungeons at least for fun.
[4:08:46] Coriollis: is gonna be pretty terrible for ded pop realms

[4:09:30] Eluniar: Dead pop realms are a problem independent of LFG tho

[4:10:55] ThisIzD: asmon and others attribute lfg to killing the social side of the game
[4:10:55] MILESkg21: just 1 POGGERS
[4:10:55] tragicjm: I think they probably heard people like asmon complain about LFG and are using a non retail version to test it out
[4:10:56] LightBladeStream: I would not want LFD without a major overhaul, like making it less important to speedrun to the end and skip everything
[4:11:00] Mitune: also heroics are piss easy. The idea of taking more time to make a group than beating the dungeon sounds awful
[4:11:11] HonestPhilosophy: Hell yeh, just started keto and fasting and that sounds awesome.
[4:11:11] tronbadgames: TBH - for someone with limited time for additional games etc, LFG is a godsend, and will likely decide how often i play
[4:11:21] bubonicblade: @Heyhowsitgoingtonight I think people just like being teleported to and out of the dungeon without having to go their themselves.

[4:15:52] TheItalianStallion321: i was watching Qwik last night he literally stated the point of WoW is they are all kinds of difficulties for everyone
[4:16:01] MerffTV: I'd agree that some raid encounters on heroic and mythic *sometimes* feel like they have one too many mechanics. Same for trash in keys, like five different interrupts on one pack is excessive. Not hard, jsut excessive.
[4:16:04] Truthseeker96: @geokouts wait til you get geared you'll be solo'ing just about everything in the game
[4:16:10] razatiger23: Blizzard spends so much time on mythic when 99.9% of players wont even touch that content while its relavant

[4:20:02] fat_european0: what even is the darkfallen?
[4:20:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Vampire elves!
[4:20:07] Vendralos: @truthseeker96 It didn't used to be that way though, and the game was in a much healthier state
[4:20:20] tragicjm: @vendralos for you
[4:20:29] TacDuc: @Vendralos No, but about people crafting gear, that you as a casual player can get the gear by getting it crafted
[4:20:40] Merex760: Darkfallen allied race would be cool though
[4:20:43] emozombiemonkey: Not going to lie... I wish the dark fallen would be an allied race.

[4:21:40] Truthseeker96: @Vendralos yeah it catered to most of the player base back then. I kinda agree. you could be anyone back then and still be a champion ingame
[4:21:45] Gian_Cena: @Towelliee it would be cool if they just gave us undead elves and trolls
[4:21:47] fat_european0: Vampire elves could be cool, but I personally would rather have a more unique race
[4:21:55] bargar28: Tuskar new race would be cool :D
[4:22:03] Praetour: We need Tuskarr race, it's been too long

[4:22:38] MeisterPetze: thats why no preorder
[4:22:41] TacDuc: Darkfallen seem pretty meh, and then it would make more sense with horde getting them. But let's see what happens.
[4:22:42] hey_im_hy: they def have potential dates
[4:22:43] monsai83: share holders will force activision to push blizzard to release it this year

[4:23:06] Cafe0le: he did say it is far along, been worked for years
[4:23:11] cudlsac: i think best case is we get the next expansion in 9 months
[4:23:19] monute316: go ask him he is streaming now lol
[4:23:22] Aidler: people were trying to pressure Mike with all sorts of questions yesterday while he was streaming
[4:23:23] CYNIC308: what is this Darkfallen? Blood Elves arent edgy enough? LUL
[4:23:24] mavericks312: @bypized eh they could have put the release date 12/31 like every other game does and move the date if needed
[4:23:25] Rayzodoom: naw just that there is a date but it hasn't been announced so he isn't gonna say it
[4:23:48] sotsil_: Q1 2023 is the safe bet @Towelliee
[4:23:49] Armdel: haven't they said they are always one or two expansions ahead
[4:23:50] jeffgamesttv: i say it releases in quarter 1 next year
[4:23:58] maldgoat: tbc was worked on b4 classic
[4:24:03] bearlyeducated: @Towelliee As someone who quit in 9.1, is it worth coming back now or waiting until 10.0 pre-patch?
[4:24:03] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || THE BIRTH OF CHADBOMB!! - WoW 9 to 5 Episode 1 youtu.be/8qc5QklRzIo
[4:24:23] mavericks312: @bearlyeducated 9.2 is the most fun of slands
[4:24:29] stabzmcgeee: @bearlyeducated imo 9.2 has been the best patch we have gotten in awhile
[4:24:29] Rayzodoom: apparently there is also a 9.2.5 date internally
[4:24:30] cudlsac: 9 months is when i think were getting the next expansion
[4:24:31] Mitune: Imo I think they shifted a massive amount of the team to 10.0 from 9.1 onward but that is just my conspiracy theory
[4:24:34] JumpTroopC5: Sure there is someone thinking about options for several expansions after dragon flight
[4:24:42] bypized: They need a release window to be able to put the game to pre order and sell it legally
[4:24:43] Zerfell: Q1 2023 is the range right now

[4:25:43] Eluniar: 0 testing, just release the alpha and patch it later IMO, can't be worse than they did with Shadowlands
[4:25:45] cappei: Pre-patch in Nov 2022. I'll trust Scaleface since he was right about everything LUL

[4:26:58] Nokterian: Bfa they had to fix the HoA
[4:27:03] cappei: @mavericks312 Dunno, ask the leaker who was right about everything. And released his leaks before the 4chan guy who said Jan 2023. No reason not to trust him

[5:50:20] Maytan26: wrath was the peak
[5:50:24] RiptoreCA: Do you think they try and move to game pass for the next expac?
[5:50:33] SilkeySmooth: more people are familar with lfd wrath not no lfd wrath
[5:50:34] FranciscoTheMage: Wrath was just the expac of all expacs
[5:50:34] felinesanonymous: I just want my DK named Beevus back yo lmao. May as well go for world first 80 tbfh
[5:50:41] Morduuh: Ulduar, nuff said
[5:50:44] tomcruise210: and also the first plateau
[5:50:47] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: cata was tied for the peak too
[5:50:59] iamWaritself: Cata classic is just Dragonflight
[5:50:59] DallTV_: shadowland clasic
[5:51:01] Maytan26: i'm 100% blizz will add dungeon finder before release
[5:51:01] JoeyBagadonuts: i was super looking forward to wrath classic til i heard LFD was gone, my fave thing about wrath got axed
[5:51:02] Yagr6: when is shadowlands classic LUL
[5:51:04] DallTV_: :P hahahha
[5:51:05] fkinthiccbro: thats the expansion that ruined ret paladins -.-
[5:51:05] CIPher38652: need BFA classic
[5:51:10] DevilSpire: get ready to spend another year in  ICC
[5:51:14] tomcruise210: they gonna do wrath UNLEASHED after icc instead of doin ruby sanctum
[5:51:15] Relic7: KEKW Cata Classic
[5:51:20] Relic7: That will have Classic Andys dying irl
[5:51:21] FranciscoTheMage: whats the future for Classic once Wrath is done
[5:51:23] SilkeySmooth: wod classic+ with content
[5:51:33] RiptoreCA: I would rather see MoP than cata classic. lol
[5:51:33] bypized: Cata Classic happens because Dragonflight will be Cata 2.0 @Towelliee
[5:51:35] Relic7: MoP Classic would be sick tho!
[5:51:38] HilariousMax: yeah I left before End Times
[5:51:38] Aggravius: bfa classic lets go
[5:51:41] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: cata was great
[5:51:41] CIPher38652: I need Ruby sanctum NOW
[5:51:47] ArcaneSyntax: cat's just a worse wrath
[5:51:51] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: pvp was lit in cata
[5:51:58] SilkeySmooth: wod classic+ with content lets go

[5:52:09] amesalbertb: CATA is still in the game, so no point.
[5:52:15] fkinthiccbro: brooo, ulduar is what it's all about
[5:52:16] Snabido: Ruby what? Kappa
[5:52:18] zgag: For Dragonflight to be good Blizzard should start looking at feedback right now. The 4 dungeon limit to start off the Xpac already has plenty of dislikes
[5:52:19] RiptoreCA: I think Ulduar is top tier for raids.
[5:52:20] mute_paladin: HE must be a troll... Ruby Sanctum?
[5:52:24] tomcruise210: what about wrath unleashed after icc
[5:52:26] CIPher38652: Hey it gave me something to do

[5:53:21] HilariousMax: waitwaitwait, what was the one you had to pick Red/Green/whatever dragon and use their abilities?
[5:53:25] Arms_Warrior: ARP or crit melee trinket
[5:53:30] CodyKane: 25 man he dropped trinks
[5:53:37] doomester: @Towelliee check the loot as paladin or warrior
[5:53:38] monsai83: i thought people did that mainly for the mounts
[5:53:38] doomester: not monk
[5:53:40] hatsihansu: @HilariousMax Eye of Eternity
[5:53:40] Austei: maybe no monk trinkets
[5:53:59] RiptoreCA: I think the achievements weight in older expacs including Wrath makes it a big draw. The achievements now are so overbloated and very few players care.
[5:54:00] Ghostpuddlez: i remeber going full block to paladin tank the welps for the 3 drake sartharion
[5:54:03] HilariousMax: oh nvm then lol yeah I don't know what Ruby Sanctum is lol thanks @hatsihansu
[5:54:03] hatsihansu: @HilariousMax or oculus for the dungeon where you actually had to pick dragons
[5:54:04] zgag: The minute that Ion hears about dislikes he always refers to "The team had/has a vision".  Then the feedback goes on death ears, months go by and we then hear an apology from Blizzard.

[5:57:49] PretentiousCat: Remember in wrath when PLD spells for prot were based on weapon damage and that slow ass  1 handed from saurfang in ICC made prot paladins compete for high raid dps? That was nice for like 2 weeks before hotfix.

[6:06:14] Gravelode: where is wow music BibleThump
[6:06:16] SilkeySmooth: take the borrowed with you..lol
[6:06:18] FranciscoTheMage: some die harder say tier should be earned not given
[6:06:20] Cafe0le: catalyst came 2 weeks late tho
[6:06:23] manmower: they should mix up the talent trees regularly, like POE
[6:06:25] Molvonos: @tomcruise210 There's a questline that starts around the northern desert area if you've unlocked one of the cypher types.  After you finish the entire line, one of the npcs is a vendor over by Ra'fiim's cave that sells you stuff for First One Cyphers, including Pocopoc
[6:06:29] ditaern: I still think it took a little too long for it to release though
[6:06:36] zepengoon: Returning player, what is the catalyst system?
[6:06:50] bgriff87: KEKW
[6:06:51] tomcruise210: @tomcruise210 thanks so much thats awesome.
[6:06:52] Pansarpatrik: Blood DK or Prot Pala?
[6:07:11] manmower: the week mythic opened would be nice
[6:07:29] pavepawns: creation catalyst is amazing and i truly hope they keep it
[6:07:34] Gravelode: prot war doing good in pvp atm
[6:07:39] CIPher38652: I think justice badges was a good choice.. taking them out was bad for casuals
[6:07:40] LightBladeStream: Maybe 2 weeks after mythic
[6:07:44] tomcruise210: yea and the great vault is a good one too
[6:07:46] SilkeySmooth: there is a rex troy one shot prot warrior maco
[6:08:03] tomcruise210: nice
[6:08:04] Cafe0le: did they say if the first tier is just cosmetic or ?
[6:08:06] LightBladeStream: Would they ever "wait" for the race tho, instead of having a set in stone date?
[6:08:10] ClockworkZen: I'll admit, I'm a casual.. and gearing up in Shadowlands has been absolute garbage. There's like half a dozen systems of how to get loot and currencies and reputations... It's dumb.
[6:08:11] IianaDRK: they like how the vault has played out in shadowlands
[6:08:15] manmower: give us an item and currency each week
[6:08:15] niebvelungen: the vault is really good in context to the random chest
[6:08:22] wisplingz: they can just add some bonus things to vault imo
[6:08:23] the_bad_goat: Plan on running high keys with your brew today?
[6:08:28] ArcaneSyntax: they said they like that the vault can give you sockets now.
[6:08:29] tomcruise210: i have alot of faith in 10.0, i know COPIUM but idc
[6:08:35] Scoodles91: if you can pick one from each bracket, it will be better
[6:08:36] Snabido: Vault is nice, tune the duplicates a bit maybe
[6:08:40] TacDuc: Maybe they make it so that people can't get the same item as choices
[6:08:47] 91Niki: Someone in org goes "Can someone spare me 2k i'm a new player" I look at their achievements and they got over 800 achievements, including from Shadowlands renown LUL So sad that some people fall for that scam
[6:08:50] ditaern: Make the vault give tokens that you can trade for the gear you want. No RNG bullshit
[6:08:56] daniel85mg: Salmon relics

[6:09:43] aladinsane909: Bugsnax
[6:09:52] mavericks312: but your playing an MMO rng is a thing
[6:09:54] ditaern: The tokens ONLY comes from the vault
[6:09:57] niebvelungen: i really like m+ this season
[6:09:59] Snabido: Cap those token gear to LFR ilvl, done Kappa
[6:10:03] wisplingz: 3x token for 1 gear might work
[6:10:05] Vendralos: I want Badges back
[6:10:08] niebvelungen: +15 is not so hard as it was in 9.0
[6:10:21] elbinn: im fine with vault gearing but i would also like a slow grind you can have towards vendor gear that is comparable to raid gear
[6:10:21] niebvelungen: and a lot of specs are viable
[6:10:26] FranciscoTheMage: the purpose of the vault is to encourage players to do certain stuff
[6:10:28] ArcaneSyntax: can confirm I'm 260+ ilvl and I haven't done any raiding outside of LFR.
[6:10:31] FranciscoTheMage: and get rewarded
[6:10:32] ditaern: Yes
[6:10:33] DinkytheDoodle: @Towelliee what do you think about bringing back bonus rolls in a limited capactiy? LIke say 1-3 per week like we used to have.
[6:10:34] Yagr6: i do not raid and im 270
[6:10:45] Malitor: The main thing I disliked about ZM... I got Cypher-Etched Ring like 500 times. I don't like farming the same items with just higher item level
[6:10:47] Crypticedge: no thanks
[6:10:48] CIPher38652: brb shoulder tokens when I need legs
[6:10:52] Aronah1982: Old valor system was like that
[6:11:10] mavericks312: nah keep the vault
[6:11:10] Serrion1321: Honestly token is better then gear! That way you can at least get what you want instead of rnd crap
[6:11:14] reqia86: @Towelliee gear adjustment tokens...lets u change a stat to another one...like vers to mastery
[6:11:14] FranciscoTheMage: why does it have to be Vault vs Bonus Rolls
[6:11:15] CIPher38652: Interface makes it more "GAME CONTENT"
[6:11:17] FranciscoTheMage: why not both
[6:11:20] manmower: put a talent system on the vault, so we can modify the rng
[6:11:26] callmestray: yeah vault is nice
[6:11:27] Arocian: I like the way the vault works
[6:11:27] Yagr6: the vault makes sense
[6:11:27] winchez_: just a weekly cool down to get a piece of gear
[6:11:32] ronpearlman: I feel the Vault is a fair compromise
[6:11:33] niebvelungen: big true
[6:11:33] CIPher38652: Vault is just another RNG
[6:11:35] Otton_03: Make it so if you take nothing from 2 weekly vault you get a token

[6:12:58] Ravager1240: Vault is useless to me.. I dont do those either.. I just quest and explore
[6:13:00] annokev: Same here as clockwork, achivements, pet battles and alts
[6:13:00] OneMagicPickle: I just don’t like getting updates
[6:13:01] moofia1980: badges were way better
[6:13:05] Heyhowsitgoingtonight: quest and collect stuff
[6:13:08] bgriff87: I dance for money in Org
[6:13:11] manmower: maybe everyone get a xmog vault option if they do other content?
[6:13:12] the_bad_goat: Make gold?
[6:13:13] Owlkapone: Goldshire inn.. Enough said
[6:13:13] callmestray: for me: collecting, older rep, achivements
[6:13:14] ClockworkZen: I play for story content, leveling, and world quests
[6:13:15] Malitor: I just quest and level toons.. never have used the vault
[6:13:19] Yagr6: professions
[6:13:19] TeejayOCE: atm all I do is mount farm and dailys lol
[6:13:24] MaleFrom73: never opened a vault myself. Only do out world stuff
[6:13:27] Arocian: chance for gear from whatever raid you do, then chance of gear from vault from amount of whatever raid you do plus if you don't like the rng gear from vault you can pull tokens to buy rep, etc...it works great
[6:13:30] ClockworkZen: Mostly because when I used to raid LFR, the atmosphere was too toxic to be worth it
[6:13:34] FranciscoTheMage: There plenty he could be doing but to EXPECT rewards along the lines of what the vault gives is what is different @Towelliee
[6:13:34] Molvonos: An isometric talent system for the vault, to give you a new currency called 'Attaboys'
[6:13:35] Ravager1240: @Towelliee I quit raiding back in BC
[6:13:36] Yagr6: giga chads play the AH
[6:13:37] JoeyBagadonuts: same here, just solo stuff mostly
[6:13:38] Snabido: Add a 4 layer for that, but cosmetic rewards then I guess?
[6:13:38] ditaern: IT's disheartening to see your friends get tier pieces from their vault and you get nothing until the creation catalyst comes out.
[6:13:39] polski67uk: Fishing….
[6:13:46] annokev: Love watching people like yourself doing M Plus but not taking part
[6:13:49] CIPher38652: I lost all my friends so I stopped playing
[6:13:53] Crypticedge: to each their own, but youre missing out every week!
[6:14:06] Vendralos: People want gear vendors back
[6:14:06] SilkeySmooth: thats a good idea
[6:14:08] Grunton: i would do more mythic+ but people get weird in them
[6:14:10] wisplingz: I think +20s must give more ilvl in vault
[6:14:12] RiptoreCA: Btw, what do the tokens from the vault right now do?
[6:14:16] manmower: i think if you fill out one of the lines completely, raids, mythic, pvp, you should get one item per row
[6:14:19] KingSlayerYotam: so wrath again?
[6:14:23] TacDuc: Even with super shitty RNG I would choose the vault
[6:14:23] lurker198: tokens are too linear IMO
[6:14:24] mrsuflakis: vault + token
[6:14:26] bypized: Zero RNG makes it less of an MMO IMO
[6:14:36] Yagr6: i think they want a pve vendor just like the pvp vendor? @Towelliee
[6:14:38] JoeyBagadonuts: since i do mostly solo stuff, ive never used the vault
[6:14:52] Arocian: hahahaha
[6:14:55] AzizianQ: LUL
[6:14:59] infinityarty: hahaha
[6:14:59] manmower: we pay our wow taxes
[6:15:01] Crypticedge: Lots of Bong Toke idea in here
[6:15:01] 91Niki: GIVE ME EVERYTHING HYPERS
[6:15:01] RadRage69: kek
[6:15:02] Truthseeker96: lol
[6:15:04] BelllGoR: so like FF loot system?
[6:15:04] D3m0nHunt3r666: Kappa
[6:15:07] annokev: I want a vault for pet battle stuff
[6:15:08] Alepouditsa: danKEK
[6:15:12] Spathotan: These are the same people thatll be bitching about nothing to do in 2 weeks
[6:15:12] Coriollis: than we want to reforge too :)
[6:15:13] MaxFury_: Just give us 9 pieces of gear each week
[6:15:13] infinityarty: raid gear done in a week Kappa
[6:15:14] Kelmor: and bonus loot, lets go
[6:15:16] bypized: This guy wants to beat an MMO like he beats Elden Ring
[6:15:19] og_gt710: just bring back justice/valor mop style and have a vendor we can buy appropriate ilvl gear from
[6:15:20] AzizianQ: just mail it to me LUL
[6:15:21] reqia86: maybe if there wasnt anything u want u could get a token and save up 4 and pick a piece u want
[6:15:24] FrostyySnapps: log in log out
[6:15:24] furrythighs: My only complaint as a tank is trying to get scale AGAIN
[6:15:25] HaxzorJimDuggan: i want it all i want it all
[6:15:26] Molvonos: 'I dont want to play the game.  JUST GEAR.'  Like a dog that doesnt wanna give up its ball.
[6:15:27] CIPher38652: I want the vault to be like a slot machine.. but the token in, pull the lever and RNG LOOT
[6:15:27] JackedDown: Shit yeah throw some bonus rolls in there too
[6:15:35] Alepouditsa: @annokev yes! and raids that are only for pet battels
[6:15:36] notColt45: Give me all the loot upfront then I can spend more time on the forums complaining dead game Kappa
[6:15:39] Crypticedge: I want it all and i want it now lol
[6:15:46] bgriff87: pepeMeltdown bonus rolls
[6:15:46] ClockworkZen: Honestly, I liked Benethic gear from BfA. I could do my daily content, earn a currency, and gear up my alts to a reasonable level
[6:15:47] manmower: make us play the ley lines game to unlock our vault
[6:15:49] zoovthepally: I just want to banish items so they don’t show up again
[6:15:53] Unwary: Just skip the middle man and let us start with a max level character in full purple gear
[6:15:56] mavericks312: players want all the rewards and no work
[6:15:57] infinityarty: What about bonus rolls yhea? anychance them returning next week?
[6:15:58] im_n0t_jezus: bonus rolls
[6:16:10] bypized: @Towelliee I want the Vault to be like Trainwrecks stream
[6:16:22] valianya: If Vault has no piece you want, have it give currency youcan save up to buy pieces off vendor
[6:16:31] manmower: should be a token that upgrades one of your items to a 278
[6:16:33] y0rtek: bonus rolls sucked ass. nothing felt worse than rolling getting gold or some shit currency
[6:16:36] Truthseeker96: Mythic tier from M+ in vault is omega huge, it should stay
[6:16:37] Dark_lite7: my head NotLikeThis
[6:16:38] ditaern: Also Vault 'tokens' are account wide so you can gear alts
[6:16:39] infinityarty: to many tokens lol
[6:16:39] annokev: @bypized ded ded ded
[6:16:40] bgriff87: yo dawg
[6:16:40] furrythighs: that would be cool
[6:16:44] NEMERL: that would be ok
[6:16:47] valianya: @towelliee currency not token
[6:16:48] MeisterPetze: get rid of seasons
[6:16:49] Crinoxo: !alpha
[6:16:49] Moobot: @Crinoxo WoW 10.0 Alpha SOON TM: https://www.wowhead.com/news/encrypted-10-0-dragonflight-build-now-on-wowdev-server-326816 || Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[6:16:50] FrankTizzle: You guys want gear too fast
[6:16:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: or just use the token to buy the item directly from a special vendor in the different ilvls
[6:16:56] niebvelungen: @ditaern this will never happen
[6:16:56] furrythighs: cause losing scale to dps that dont want to tank DOS feels bad
[6:17:08] Zyvuun: This token you refer to Towelliee, is it fungable?
[6:17:08] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[6:17:19] Truthseeker96: @FrankTizzle I'm already geared to the teeth only other thing that can give me ilvl is mythic raiding or vault
[6:17:20] leon1071: trade in tokens for extra creation catalyst charge
[6:17:22] onybear: I don’t know if you have said token enough yet…
[6:17:29] ChiliMoMilli: I just want ranked pvp to be like lost arks system. Just equalize that shit and make ranked pvp be cosmetic, titles, and mount only
[6:17:36] ditaern: @ditaern Don't rip my hopium from my cold dead hands
[6:17:37] tomcruise210: are they going to add vendors in 9.2.5?
[6:17:40] alphadonnut: the hard part accepting you/me will never get some things out of the game (pvp vs mythic vs collections). i like pvp gear for pvp only, mythic gear for mythic only, then open world gear for that only
[6:17:43] Belasard: it would be cool if there was a row for solo content, like some kind of thorgast progression (thorgast would have be fitting challenge of course)
[6:17:44] TompsonX: You can just have the vendor himself boost the item you select, no need for a second totem, it's kinda like najzatar gear
[6:17:49] Kpxt: Marks of Honor?
[6:17:52] SilkeySmooth: mediallon?
[6:17:52] infinityarty: brawlers gold?
[6:17:53] mrsuflakis: relic?
[6:17:53] Ziddrax: the badge?
[6:17:53] homewrecker101: mark of honor?
[6:18:02] juic3b0x12: quartemaster badge
[6:18:03] draxss: i want bonus tokens over
[6:18:16] Smeaghoul: @Towelliee What about Destiny 2's way of upgrading item level. You can take a higher item level piece of gear and bump another item from the same slot. This way you can bump the gear you desire
[6:18:17] GRVPHX: relics of the past
[6:18:24] SilkeySmooth: thats it quatermaster badge
[6:18:28] manmower: that would be cool, or a token that does a titanforge on a piece
[6:18:35] juic3b0x12: Quatermasters writ or bnadge
[6:18:53] ronpearlman: **Wakening Essence?**
[6:18:54] y0rtek: titanforge was a curse, never mention that system
[6:18:59] tomcruise210: @Smeaghoul man i miss playing that game..i stopped when cayde died
[6:18:59] fistofnature: no titanforging pleasse NotLikeThis
[6:19:24] Measai: yes titanforging pls
[6:19:31] Smeaghoul: @tomcruise210 I did too, went back to play witch and its fun
[6:19:33] TompsonX: That doesn't sound bad tho
[6:19:48] Mozzeyy_: @tomcruise210 its better than ever atm
[6:19:51] manmower: wouldn't work in dragonflight seasons, thought they're changing the m+ dungeons each season now
[6:20:21] Truthseeker96: no titanforging pls, yall want it. I want it. But truth is we will all be farming for our BIS trinket with the max titanforge for the WHOLE expansion and may never get it
[6:20:28] mmrghost7: i hope they abondon that idea
[6:20:40] manmower: turning WoW into a 'seasons' game
[6:20:47] Coox69: the idea is great i hope they will nail it
[6:20:51] CIPher38652: Dragonforced Gear
[6:20:58] Snabido: Think I got it: They were called Trophies towelliee
[6:21:06] annokev: I should get 278 gear for free for having 1500 pets
[6:21:12] KingSlayerYotam: towHAMUP
[6:21:15] ClockworkZen: Just to be clear, I only spoke up because I'm an outlier that isn't getting plentiful gear like most other players. I'm not insisting that Blizzard tweak the game to suit me, but there have been gear catch up systems that were more casual friendly than Shadowlands
[6:21:16] Tokies: thanks for the stream
[6:21:21] daniel85mg: what
[6:21:23] notColt45: Wait what?
[6:21:25] Coriollis: china prime time SeemsGood
[6:21:27] HaxzorJimDuggan: my ass is probably still gonna be in bed when the announcement happens
[6:21:30] thagalvir: They should probably do shorter seasons or maybe 1 season has 2  or 3 sets of dungeons
[6:21:31] ClockworkZen: Thanks for streaming Towelliee
[6:21:32] daniel85mg: holy crap thats early
[6:21:32] Grunton: would be cool if old raids and dungeons could be relevant and not pushovers mode
[6:21:45] FranciscoTheMage: will it be in english?
[6:21:52] Kyettcetera: Oh perfect, Lost Ark finally finished loading right as you're wrapping up
[6:21:55] notColt45: Well at least get the news right as I wake up
[6:22:01] c0mmander_starscream: lol 7:30 is early as fuck even on the east coast
[6:22:02] razatiger23: Its crazy how they are still trying to push that game when it runs on the bones of D3
[6:22:14] y0rtek: pretty sure it was the release date we saw when we joined the waitlist lol
[6:22:16] Atem___: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[6:22:19] Molehj: byebye
