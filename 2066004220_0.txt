[1:39:20] DakuiOG: just go hs
[1:39:21] Elijahss: parry for pvp
[1:39:27] glutenrich69: parry
[1:39:43] Renfuryy: if you lose a 1v1 because you didnt parry thats not good keking
[1:39:51] Elijahss: yeah parry speds up your autos right?
[1:39:58] Elijahss: speeds*
[1:39:59] glutenrich69: when you parry your auto attack is hasted btw
[1:40:18] mcstealth666: sucks

[1:40:53] theman10n: just better to take some shots to gain rage
[1:40:54] Krayno: it's really good. it increases your rage generation in combat
[1:40:59] Krayno: its badly worded
[1:41:17] iamellore: it was hidden buff aswell

[1:46:16] Veranus: q
[1:48:07] Naxim1: why do you have so many heroic strikes?
[1:48:35] glutenrich69: heroic strike is very good YEP
[1:50:00] uBm3D: dragonchilli lasts for 10 minutes and makes like 5 % more dmg over that time
[1:50:11] glutenrich69: in the jungel YEP
[1:50:35] moisttowelette21: Do you plan on using Blood Surge, or Precise Timing for Gnomer?
[1:50:39] DakuiOG: @Renfuryy D:
[1:51:07] Renfuryy: @Renfuryy no survivability except disperse poor
[1:51:10] Elijahss: Precise timing
[1:51:19] Elijahss: It does say
[1:51:20] Veranus: I need to fight elite ogres in strongarde for quest?
[1:51:26] Elijahss: look at the talent part
[1:51:30] moisttowelette21: I personally used Precise Timing in my run last night, Since Blood Surge procs only off HS, Blood Thirst and WW
[1:51:38] DakuiOG: @Renfuryy I don't want you two to fight D: that's what I meant keking
[1:51:45] Renfuryy: @Renfuryy oh ICANT
[1:51:49] Renfuryy: fuegoFaded
[1:51:50] moisttowelette21: so using Blood surge as a 2h warrior, requires you to use Quick Strike, which I don't think is worth.
[1:51:55] DakuiOG: @Renfuryy xffCute
[1:51:59] Elijahss: I like that build
