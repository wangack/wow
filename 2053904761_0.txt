[0:32:53] icntblvit: @Eonx Who did Echo lose to?
[0:33:05] jamminlove: Idk what annoys me the most, the insane mobility making positioning useless or cd-meta or lack of cc
[0:33:20] Eonx: @icntblvit Lava Lava and someone else didn't watch it all
[0:33:26] jamminlove: I too want to play the new expansion but pls fix the game

[0:34:19] d1vbno: they need to like remake all of that shit for it to be good again

[0:34:37] thommy_brasco: sounds like wrath pally
[0:34:40] jamminlove: :'(
[0:34:59] jamminlove: If they keep everything but make positioning important again would already be a huge win
[0:34:59] notmorbos: plus the fact blizz forgets pvp exists for 80% of every xpac. but i guess we have that in wrath too
[0:35:13] glycinexz: 3 targets in your gladdy

[4:15:11] diorbifocals: if he counter geared he coulda killed feral easier. it’s not about dmg it’s his lack of expertise
[4:15:20] icntblvit: @Minpojke He does have the ring and the boots from RS tho, no?
[4:15:26] Blackbettytv: But the priest doenst get any tankier than when ICC was only out

[5:09:53] Dokkotter: @Odezq gameplay is actually fun in wotlk compared to other expansions that's why
[5:10:18] Odezq: @Dokkotter u got my point, these games makes ur brain dead especially when u meet same matchup many times in a row
[5:10:38] zeuthenx: Couldn't the lock drain mana spam mage?
[5:10:40] 고마워요베이스드갓: >not disabling adblock for ur favourite streamers
[5:10:43] Odezq: if they add dampening that would be neat
[5:10:49] tksteezx: people only ‘like’ 2s in wotlk cause you can get glad/titles from it
[5:10:50] scopemeup: hmm... this mage was never this mad when he played with hydro... guess hydra is a better coach?
[5:10:52] zeuthenx: Or is that tbc strat too :D
[5:11:03] tksteezx: remove that and suddenly no one would play it
[5:11:30] Dokkotter: @tksteezx not true. 2s has almost always been the most played bracket in any expansion. Wotlk does it best and easily the most fun.
[5:11:59] tksteezx: lol 2s is dead at high rating in every expansion after 2s titles was removed
[5:12:09] Odezq: @Dokkotter u clearly havent played enough 2s then without dampening =D
[5:12:38] Dokkotter: again not true dude, why are u just pulling out bullshit out of ur ass rofl. Streamers literally lived in 2s before solo queue
[5:12:39] bonyato: Peepo
[5:12:45] GarrinchA: although the setup diversity was low in tbc, i think 2 vs 2 arena was as good as wotlk, if not better
[5:13:08] Dokkotter: on retail that is.
[5:13:19] scopemeup: hpala (aka the best healer) is just inherently boring to play against
[5:13:51] scopemeup: tbc druid for example was as broken but at least you could do something else besides healbotting
[5:14:02] tksteezx: @dokkotter people only did 2s during the day until 3s queues were more active at night lol. now solo shuffle is the replacement for 2s
[5:14:22] tksteezx: 3s has always been the main bracket for every high rated player
[5:14:50] Dokkotter: well of course its the main bracket because u get a title out of it, but u're saying people would stop playing if titles were removed. Which is not true.
[5:14:58] tksteezx: theres a reason why they removed 2s titles in original wotlk cause its an awful braxjet
[5:15:21] Yonyret: What are you expecting on 3S BRACKET xD
[5:15:26] tksteezx: people would stop prioritizing 2s over 3s if titles were removed yes
[5:15:28] Yonyret: same comp again and again
[5:15:51] rebarmuskel: 2s is more fun to watch imo

[5:34:08] shozgodx: XD
[5:34:09] Deicidiumx: I think what makes wrath  better than live is that every 2s comp has enough threats that you don't need dampening. Every class has a healer-dps comp that can close out the game. what u guys think?
[5:34:12] shook93: gg
[5:34:24] oldmeta1: GG
[5:34:25] malyoyo: repair bro :D before getting them again
