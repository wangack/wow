[2:08:16] JQ47: Assumed meta
[2:08:17] Fawcheddar: the players kinda decided
[2:08:19] Osilon33: top lane is normally the longest lane

[2:08:31] cyrex172: u can but. its not optimal
[2:08:31] 1halfatwin: You dont wanna be squishy in top lane
[2:08:31] kimmo_gaming: its designed that either you give it or receive it lol
[2:08:47] xRykku: Do they still add new characters to league?
[2:08:50] NicStone8: more or less its just a generally assigned solo lane enabling your team to have a jungler. while most people run duo bot lane that tends to be a support and attack carry
[2:08:50] xHukk: LUL
[2:08:56] ElGompers: Ganked lol
[2:08:58] cyrex172: overextending means ur exposing urself to ganks
[2:08:58] JQ47: Players decide the meta and lol has kinda enforced it
[2:08:58] intimidation_MD: just how the lane assignments worked out years ago.  the top lane is where your melee fighter/tank went, mid was a caster/mage, and bot was always the ad carry ranger and a support champ of some sort (weaker tank usually)
[2:09:03] xHukk: @xRykku Yes, non stop
[2:09:15] metavahn231: you bought the wrong item.!! what is this WoW?
