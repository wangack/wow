[0:15:00] evolvebr: its not pro bono
[0:15:03] FCLiver: she has no phone
[0:15:06] opwonkinobi: I believe she cannot make legal decisions without her dads consent
[0:15:07] evolvebr: pro bono just means free, period
[0:15:12] Taargus_435: pro bono is 100% free
[0:15:13] Mavryk: its 15 minutes of fame though, and then if the lawyer loses, they made no money, and loses any reputation they had.
[0:15:19] silentchu: I dont think she is allowed to call people
[0:15:22] Taargus_435: contingency is when you do it for a percentage of the winnings
