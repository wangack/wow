[0:17:18] Raikubest: It was mid arena aalty so what i did was I canceld my wow recorder i canceld all my tabs because on tolvir he casted clone on like 20-30% into his cast and i was in a clone so i was like " UHHH someting is weird i said out loud in discord "

[0:18:19] ardalolthe: @Whaazz I think hollibang is like F tier they will rekt everyone 1 week and not make it top 6 next week
[0:18:24] LyusinatoR: if warr is madatory against them and you said you are not prepared than ping is not your problem
[0:18:28] Deathmarkedx: not setting up other classes just in case i guess

[1:30:03] Jkrx: @aframpp we already established that link was there, you can see the animation
[1:30:07] Injekce: no one was in link when cdew casted it thats why he didnt get heal
[1:30:08] Malte_L: game starts @Whaazz
[1:30:09] shredder1111: imagine if cdew fat fingered it into china
[1:30:09] aframpp: no you can't
[1:30:11] GalachadQT: they havent even seen the totem yet ZZZZZZZZZ

[1:30:23] thewordtv: its right behind the druids leg it gets deathed
[1:30:24] Jkrx: I'm pretty sure he missed the link tho, that's why it didn't heal
[1:30:25] ckbrah: @whaazz maybe SP echoing void procced instantly when it spawns? it breaks cc etc so could be it
[1:30:26] jBeastwood: i mean sam's
[1:30:27] shyshytv: The link was there we say it connected to Sam
[1:30:33] Jkrx: otherwise there would have been a green link to cdew as well
[1:30:41] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz it was the SP tier set
[1:30:41] Moobot: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJFHadK6prEPYQuCmR0tsug
[1:30:41] Injekce: link was there but cdew wasnt in it to get sam healed

[1:30:51] Dyssyx: we'll find out after the fact
[1:30:53] hollow1zed: @Whaazz he had to have missed and put the link on the pillar and then moved it to them
[1:30:54] shyshytv: Cause the tendril is hitting sam
[1:30:55] BCboy_: spectator lag maybe
[1:30:59] Jkrx: @badmy__ on Sam yes but not on Cdew or anyone else

[1:31:01] Dyssyx: someone will explain whether thats cdew or wizk
[1:31:01] madex7180: @whaazz its static field not link, it expires after relocating static field
[1:31:03] tmh1995: with proc
[1:31:03] slyphex: can you mindblast proc mid-channel?
[1:31:03] jBeastwood: or animation
[1:31:05] llomachenko: Maybe the visual appearance of the link didnt appear on spectator of wargame
[1:31:05] Martem98: link takes no dot damage so i dont think the apparition would kill it
[1:31:05] g1loaded: Noo when the target is low death can proc so it has no cd
[1:31:05] aurelioristv: I mean from the spectator POV it looks so sus cuz we don't see the link nameplate
[1:31:07] aframpp: maybe its a POV thing

[1:47:12] Loadedmvp: mass disrespect Kappa
[1:47:21] ImJordanHi: @Cvarks Nah I get that, but like a "mind blast" is like...I think probably UI bug before "yeahhe just reacted fast"
[1:47:21] Delxenyo: Thats why cata will be bis

[1:47:23] Cvarks: @DCBen as fire ye
[1:47:23] Martem98: was chan running reflect vs them?
[1:47:23] rizdane: it matters who plays the highest dps class and can clone the most
[1:47:25] Cuhrismuh: Just look weird kekw
[1:47:26] hellsdrains: hellsdrains subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 51 months!

[1:47:45] Warzead: you missing endless CC RMP meta I guess
[1:47:48] DCBen: i sniped a link aswell that fast @Cvarks but was more by accident on fire mage
[1:47:51] asdkl2312k3o: they can balance RMP so no ty KEKW
[1:47:53] mysticalmoun: true mate
[1:47:54] iamreallyafan: then rmp will win everything left
[1:47:57] iamreallyafan: again *
[1:48:01] asdkl2312k3o: SL rmp was the worst damp shit and unkillable shit ever
[1:48:18] aleyn: Ah okay
[1:48:21] wladqz: @Whaazz why you didn't try double caster against double melee?
[1:48:24] oldschoolxlove: Nice just got adds rolling... What did you say? Wow became boring ???:0 @whaazz

[1:48:43] Martem98: MOP Classic!!!
[1:48:49] rizdane: sad to see a dh doing double dmg in a tournament against the best
[1:48:50] Cvarks: @DCBen ya the mouseover fireblast macro is super underrated
[1:49:11] Cvarks: LMFAO
[1:49:12] DCBen: its insane for grounding
[1:49:13] kreyzy8: LMAO
[1:49:13] magnesiium1: LMFAO
[1:49:13] Skotus_96: xD
[1:49:16] Gnosiis853: HAHAH
[1:49:17] QwQGolden: amazing moment honestly
[1:49:17] 焼きそばパン: lmao
[1:49:19] YUNG_AYAZ: lmaooo
[1:49:19] rollinsthechamp: The fucking sry the fucking
[1:49:19] waelrick: LUL
[1:49:20] rizdane: hey the guys excited why bash him
[1:49:37] magnesiium1: HYPE
[1:49:40] Xcyyted: Chan and Raiku already trying lock mage :P
[1:50:00] mysticalmoun: i agree with ya about random cc and win game
[1:50:16] Sillentspecter: It is refreshing having new teams and competition.
[1:50:17] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:50:19] Martem98: i want a setup meta back
[1:50:19] tv_raz: fucking is the best descriptive word ever
[1:50:22] Sibble7: Jayt is playing his balls off though.  happy for him
[1:50:24] Zero_fuqz: like outplaying ppl seems not existant
[1:50:25] EFFSIN: increase cc get rid of aoe roots
[1:50:25] JBugaboo: whaaz why is pika doing negative damage
[1:50:26] EFFSIN: gg
[1:50:37] tv_raz: i stopped watching
[1:50:39] YUNG_AYAZ: 10 min should not be the norm
[1:50:41] shyshytv: I get hype watching Woltk Arena championship times when it felt really skill based more from healers and such. Which era do you think is the best?
[1:50:44] rizdane: agree man
[1:50:45] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz was SL rmp CC good?
[1:50:47] windythemllf: Just do more damage 4Head
[1:50:48] sarent02: this s feels like bfa s4
[1:50:48] kuringg: its just for solo shuffle, a big pve fight
[1:50:51] jilmo: mehh would never lose
[1:50:51] Moobot: Don't forget to follow my Twitter to see when I go live! https://twitter.com/Whaazz
[1:50:52] Gnosiis853: Your team already practicing MLD
[1:50:53] Steff_988: and they won on damage because of cyclonecity
[1:50:54] pwntrd: @Whaazz why didn't you guys play demo frost into ww sub? it should be a counter
[1:50:54] EFFSIN: They had some cc
[1:50:55] Steff_988: :D
[1:50:58] EFFSIN: more then other
[1:51:09] eacherro: the PVP game, where you cant punish bad decisions is not a good game…
[1:51:10] DestructibleTimes: @Whaazz that sort of cc / setup heavy gameplay hurts the lower brackets, i.e., majority of the players, idk if Blizzard will change that
[1:51:10] Malte_L: nah they move threw alot of cds out the window and had overlaps in lategame
[1:51:14] EFFSIN: i would say cdew team has more cc then sub monk cc
[1:51:26] Martem98: for me the changes to cc killed the fun of playing
[1:51:27] nuubkeike: Classes need to be unique again. Everyone now has a lot off CC thats why they nerfed CC
[1:51:31] moosader: the kill the move got on Sam was impressive though
[1:51:31] elcic3ro: how is holypriest with rm ?
[1:51:31] Martem98: especially hunter
[1:51:35] GrimGrimGrim: !bracket
[1:51:38] iamreallyafan: well pvp has never felt better, i see almost no rmp so
[1:51:39] EliasIsHere: it's. not easy to win with cc chains without dampening these days
[1:51:40] MaybeRespect: Not every comp can do long CC chains though. So how you expect them to win?
[1:51:43] Labaiblogai: it should remove mobility, classes are having too much mobility in dragonflight
[1:51:44] EliasIsHere: maybe impossible
[1:51:51] mysticalmoun: i came on dragonflight 3 months ago ... i played cata and pandaria and play style dont work here.. here its about burst and random cc, game is totaly different
[1:52:07] nuubkeike: too much micro stuns and stuff, prune that, bring CC like it was
[1:52:08] voygard: hella agree
[1:52:09] EliasIsHere: agreed
[1:52:11] Zero_fuqz: @iamreallyafan the only comp that requires skill
[1:52:13] tv_raz: too many short defensives
[1:52:14] kuringg: its not fun to play anymore due to the cc changes. Was alrdy bad with the perma rele in df s1
[1:52:14] Sibble7: Damage is so high too though
[1:52:16] jawst3k: I agree as a healer
[1:52:17] Deathmarkedx: healing is omegahigh
[1:52:19] linuswarlock: yea rouge has 20 defensives
[1:52:23] Deathmarkedx: you legit cant kill a healer 3v1 in a bg LOL
[1:52:25] tommymage: its just cc being piss
[1:52:27] ReidonGER69: the time it takes some one to heal some one from 0 to 100 is to short
[1:52:28] tommymage: and 1 min 30 trinket
[1:52:30] tommymage: is jst bad
[1:52:31] Dyssyx: Do you rate Kalvish?
[1:52:31] Balthizaar: You need high healing because everyone has defensives and the games go crazy long
[1:52:33] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz casted heals should be higher, easy fix
[1:52:33] eacherro: haha when you play BG… single healer handles 5 dps bursting him full
[1:52:35] maxx_olsson: micro cc to on some spec
[1:52:36] socbrotes: seems like too many cooldowns in general.
[1:52:41] Esotraz: Dps classes should not have healing
[1:52:41] nuubkeike: everyone has a lot of defensives and mobility and ucnessary micro ccs
[1:52:47] elcic3ro: is priest viable in rm ?
[1:52:49] tv_raz: ww fortifying brew is a good example of a strong cd on 6 min cooldown
[1:52:50] t3rra13: cdew always do the same to pikaboo, letting him win easy the first braked then raped him
[1:52:53] Deathmarkedx: healing is what is it because of shuffle nowadays
[1:52:56] Zero_fuqz: too much micro cc to stop cc chains aswell
[1:52:57] Deathmarkedx: and it wont get any weaker
[1:52:57] Labaiblogai: u cant slow anyone anymore most of the classes, they keep removing it, and that defensives are way too huge for all classes
[1:52:58] Saphya_: that wont help tho since treants exist healing through cc
[1:53:01] redfernn: What if they reduced DR duration but kept CC the same?
[1:53:04] torkija: Did you ever play WW on tourneys? I can't remember
[1:53:04] nuubkeike: since when warr has bolt + shockwave + fear thats like a stun
[1:53:09] Nahj: i love when a dragon just flys in and rescues it
[1:53:18] nuubkeike: dh, 2 stuns, imprision, fear lol
[1:53:20] EFFSIN: why didnt trill play killing spree
[1:53:22] windythemllf: Smokebomb put so much pressure on you today
[1:53:22] perraputaasco: Hey man how are u? Gj on the games :(
[1:53:23] Dyssyx: @Nahj cheesiest shit ive ever seen
[1:53:29] tv_raz: its rare at higher mmrs
[1:53:40] tv_raz: at low mmrs smoke bomb gets lots of kills
[1:53:49] slickdaddyg69: whaazz u are the stream i have the most channel points on
[1:53:53] asdkl2312k3o: they dont go druid enough
[1:53:59] SwedenBombSquad: chunli not doing eu monk dmg
[1:54:04] rhymez_aut: @slickdaddyg69 same, i just love watching Whaazz gameplay
[1:54:09] Labaiblogai: i remember you could slow dh or priest, now u cant even do that :D
[1:54:10] DCBen: who do you use the weapon on? @Whaazz carving
[1:54:14] Dyssyx: come for the gameplay, stay for the whazz
[1:54:15] Echo_Esports: Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Whaazz
[1:54:18] edition507: nothing fun in long insta cc chains. now its decent cc length paired with high dmg. fun to Watch and Play
[1:54:22] asdkl2312k3o: cleave
[1:54:25] yoeyez: mericans don't like goin druids
[1:54:26] fatulina: the cleave will lose coz of that
[1:54:32] Shad_WW: can u move the banner in top right
[1:54:33] voygard: yea that might be gg
[1:54:34] bujiburger: what are your thoughts on WWs viability in comps?
[1:54:35] code_rage: chunli damage vs Eradas :'D
[1:54:43] Deathmarkedx: does DH ever die into this
[1:54:44] voygard: blue bar too high
[1:54:58] OverdosedTW: Just remove mana Kappa
[1:55:16] Sibble7: Major complaint from me is the stealth druid drinking.  I think we are all tired of it no?  would like to see that mechanic change
[1:55:16] shredder1111: this ww/dh doesnt seem to have half the coordination of the eu ww/rouge
[1:55:17] LyusinatoR: its part of the game to not allow him to drink
[1:55:17] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[1:55:18] Nahj: i think biggest problem is dampening needs a rework
[1:55:26] aarseths: thats simply skill issue
[1:55:28] Nahj: it needs to be private server dmg/healing ramping up till sudden death
[1:55:29] LyusinatoR: its like complaining about somebody ressing in 2v3 :D
[1:55:38] voygard: same reason or at least one of the reaso why luquid rolled GG, innervate made a big difference
[1:55:42] L0WIIE: isnt drinking part of being a healer?
[1:55:42] DCBen: @Nahj ?
[1:55:43] mokeysoe: mmh what about remove healer mana?
[1:55:53] Deathmarkedx: dampening just needs to scale faster
[1:55:54] Dyssyx: @Nahj DH just wins
[1:55:58] Iceman130: yo
[1:55:59] Deathmarkedx: not shuffle faster but faster
[1:56:20] DCBen: thats like how it was in MoP @Nahj
[1:56:25] KJKtv: @Nahj very fitting for a sub rog xd
[1:56:39] Sibble7: Can't he meld into cat though and reposition to where they don't know where he is @Whaazz
[1:56:40] linuswarlock: missing mehh?
[1:56:40] mysticalmoun: there is not about cata or panda playstyle anymore.. u can see that .. its only burst burst, look these druids dont use cyclone whole game.. its just not about strategy..
[1:56:41] Iceman130: why are warriors so mediocre in this game
[1:56:47] R1_Prototype: meld/drink is a desperation trade.
[1:56:48] nuubkeike: Like I said, make classes unique again, prune micro ccs and defensives , bring back CC
[1:56:49] voygard: it is
[1:56:54] M1ndOwner: you talked about dalaran drink?
[1:57:00] nuubkeike: Also why theres always such healer unbalance lol
[1:57:08] DCBen: and they had the highest % HP team buff with 300% more damage @Nahj
[1:57:14] Shad_WW: mana looks better now somehow
[1:57:16] baljovan2147: lontar kept u guys up for days. he played amazing
[1:57:17] Martem98: what happens if somone dcs mid game?
[1:57:19] Nahj: crowd chooses you was not that ben
[1:57:30] aarseths: @nuubkeike huh? whaazz played resto sham against priest, this time its double resto?...
[1:57:30] kuringg: theres no cross cc no outplays, just pve
[1:57:34] DCBen: maybe i missunderstood you
[1:57:37] b77ar: mana dont matter when they can survive this long at 0 mana
[1:57:38] windythemllf: RLS Lontar did pre everything, so good
[1:57:39] Astriaxwarr: why isnt meh playing btw never heard the reason

[1:57:59] voygard: o7
[1:58:03] voygard: nvm
[1:58:04] pwntrd: @Nahj destro landing 1 chaos bolt and lining untill crowd chooses you wins him the game... zzzz
[1:58:08] aleyn: what do you think about the Instant Spirit Link kills from "The move" team?
[1:58:19] Xptzor: ohhh so mehhx quit the game?
[1:58:30] raqsyo: i miss chas giggling ^^
[1:58:30] behindyouu_: charke3Lmaoo
[1:58:31] Nahj: crowd chooses you was ass. I just liked how private servers made dmg/healing both go up as a tiebreaker
[1:58:31] Iceman130: chunli use to be much better
[1:58:37] nuubkeike: @aarseths yea I know, but I mean rdruid is always so much better overall, no hpalas at this time, presvoker
[1:58:38] voygard: it is man, it is a blue bar game
[1:58:40] Sillentspecter: well you have to stop drinks
[1:58:42] ImJordanHi: Better team win? Or healer didnt drink
[1:58:43] mysticalmoun: 1 cyclone in whole game on champions
[1:58:46] divix1001: hvordan gik det for jer i dag? du er den eneste grund til jeg prøver at fange jeres games
[1:58:46] Malte_L: i feel like mage would not be good either into this
[1:58:47] aoespawn: gg
[1:58:53] morizze: did mehh retire?
[1:58:53] aurelioristv: I mean isn't it simply cuz kalvish stops drinks and ww dh can't?
[1:58:56] jayyArrington: lol that was pretty boring
[1:59:03] socbrotes: bro got ran down and ate a chaos bolt.... demoralizing
[1:59:03] Thedragonsenpai: small map inc
[1:59:04] aarseths: @nuubkeike still, rn all classes are very balanced compared to wow ever imo.
[1:59:04] eacherro: boring to watch… similar to watch Apex whole they hide 20 of 23 minutes doing nothing
[1:59:10] Malte_L: yes
[1:59:10] DCBen: @Nahj just like % more damage over time?
[1:59:12] Deathmarkedx: they cant nerf healing man, what will happen to the 1600 shuffle healers then?
[1:59:13] torkija: they should remove mana completely
[1:59:14] Nahj: yea
[1:59:14] Crille3: mage would be insane? spellsteal all you need make them go oom LUL
[1:59:17] Deathmarkedx: thats why they made all these changes in the first place
[1:59:23] hiraad12: Its like a mythic boss with mana as hp bar and mechanic being to stop drinks
[1:59:25] asdkl2312k3o: @Whaazz SL was basically all mana game except season 1
[1:59:27] DCBen: would be worth a try
[1:59:30] uhboss: What % crit/vers are you aiming for on outlaw?
[1:59:36] voygard: u cant no? druid has the silence talent
[1:59:46] Zeneri: they need to nerf armor further
[1:59:48] Zeneri: xd
[1:59:49] ptwist_: buff cc Lel
[1:59:49] X2DR: should they give clone a cd ?
[1:59:50] pwntrd: buff cc / remove drinking in stealth
[1:59:52] socbrotes: Less cooldowns to trade through
[1:59:52] nuubkeike: @aarseths Not saying things arent balanced, but all classes now have huge amount of micro cc , mobility and defensives. Just bring back MoP pvp classes were unique
[1:59:54] ImJordanHi: Less micro CC more real CC
[1:59:56] pwntrd: or drinking starts to give mana after 5sec
[1:59:56] Deathmarkedx: blizzard themselves stated that they nerfed CC because "healing isnt a fun experience for lower rated players"
[1:59:57] R1_Prototype: spell steal spam would oom you faster than he runs out of spell.
[2:00:00] mysticalmoun: 1 cyclone in whole game
[2:00:09] flackobalboa: when is final?
[2:00:10] aoespawn: an offensive priest scares the crap out of me
[2:00:13] voygard: gonna bring back c9 strats KEKW
[2:00:16] louis_masterson: unlucky on the loss bro yous played well, really tuff compo

[2:00:19] kuringg: nah not with this high dmg
[2:00:19] aleyn: Play better = Win Kappa Jk
[2:00:24] Nahj: i think the amount of value per global of cc would go up
[2:00:29] Nahj: if they buffed cc duration but killed trip dr
[2:00:29] Erissgoddes: TBH ofc you want CC buffed when playing class with most CC
[2:00:36] yodaaxx: eradas played really good
[2:00:37] aarseths: @nuubkeike pvp now is better and more balanced imo.
[2:00:50] DCBen: true kill tripl dr
[2:00:54] mysticalmoun: u mean cataclysm times back?
[2:00:54] Moobot: https://www.instagram.com/oscar_wulff/
[2:00:58] nuubkeike: @aarseths I dont think so, but I respect your opinion
[2:01:01] ptwist_: Druid only healer overtuned
[2:01:01] kreyzy8: he plays hpal too
[2:01:07] IThinkThatImkobe: @Nahj only have 2 drs then?
[2:01:09] X2DR: do you think cyclone needs to have a cd ?
[2:01:13] Deathmarkedx: MoP is literally what started the "make classes similar to each other" how are people saying MoP was unique is beyond me lol
[2:01:13] Moobot: JOIN MY STREAM DISCORD WITH THIS LINK !! https://discord.com/invite/bjumdu8qBW
[2:01:18] kreyzy8: hpal/druid mainly
[2:01:23] uhboss: !stats
[2:01:28] voygard: nha cyclone aint the problem
[2:01:33] nuubkeike: Cyclone now looks more OP than before because of CC nerf
[2:01:35] fuseton: @Whaazz ppl dont know how to stop poly of a kidney after playin 100games , dont make cc even longer , let healers play the game a bit at least
[2:01:42] DCBen: poly breaks and heals
[2:01:55] ordnung99999: i think -1 duration clone woujld be fine
[2:01:56] DCBen: well not with the talent but still
[2:02:03] shredder1111: 1 boomkin across two tournaments is too much, should be 0
[2:02:05] ordnung99999: only cc who not got nerft
[2:02:07] captoblivious12: if cyclone doesnt have a cd they should remove hex's cd
[2:02:11] nuubkeike: but repentance is a paladin ability, they arent allowed to win tournaments
[2:02:17] mysticalmoun: cataclysm was about cc and strategy playin ... do you agree?
[2:02:17] aod0311x: People cry about everything and then blizzard tries to cater. That's why the game turns to ass often times.
[2:02:21] ripintides: cyclone looks op because samiyam fakes every kick and has perma precog
[2:02:21] Sibble7: Were you watching yesterday when Ziqo said how did he double blade storm? i loled
[2:02:26] kuringg: its not about the actual time you sit cc, its about how you perceive it
[2:02:31] ajpattersonx: cyclone being dispellable like poly
[2:02:32] aarseths: @aod0311x this is you crying xd
[2:02:58] kuringg: that’s why cc is aids now even tho it needs to be buffed
[2:02:58] baljovan2147: but clone not being able to be dispelled and lasts long as all other ccs is broken. Sam kept pika cc half the game. Atleast sheep and fear u can dispel
[2:03:07] baljovan2147: or reduce clone cc time
[2:03:12] LyusinatoR: ofc it is
[2:03:12] Moobot: My first vlog ever! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E690kmX6HJc
[2:03:29] Xptzor: would you like dispel with no cooldown again?
[2:03:30] Sibble7: It is definitely designed around low rated players.  they are trying to make the game playable for the average joe to make money
[2:03:32] aoespawn: clone has been 6-4-2 since beginning bash beginning lol the 20 sec maim is op
[2:03:32] Zeneri: but theres barely any new players doing pvp?
[2:03:36] SeaneyDH: do you think a sperate pvp client that is free with a battle pass would be good for pvp
[2:03:38] QwQGolden: which is why they crucified setup CC like the new blind duration lmao
[2:03:42] iamreallyafan: well, its perfect for lowrated and thats how the game should be
[2:03:45] uncannysword: every game is like this, it's not even about money
[2:03:47] jaysixthree: idk but low rated players porlly dont give a sht about balancing
[2:03:49] ptwist_: how does that make sense if pvp is dying ???
[2:03:53] Echo_Esports: Celebrate Echo's latest win in the RWF with the New World First mousepad and loads of other great merch at echogg.ly/merch/Whaazz
[2:03:59] LyusinatoR: brother Blizzard pays salaries from the money of the average player, not from you doing anti-wow statements every day
[2:04:00] Deathmarkedx: low rated healers cant even heal the way it is now, imagine if they made healing weaker KEKW
[2:04:01] Martem98: other changes could be made to get more players tho
[2:04:03] socbrotes: what % of the playerbase pvp's though... pvp is the minority
[2:04:06] pedrayy: @SeaneyDH they'd never host that to have 1k ppl playing it
[2:04:06] Sibble7: You guys in are the top 1%.  the other 99% is who they are catering too.  we are saying the same thing
[2:04:08] aod0311x: You are right whaazz. They have to bring in money.
[2:04:19] Pekara: but 2019 was covid
[2:04:21] pvalue01: shuffle is the reason for the increased participation.
[2:04:22] Pekara: so it doesnt count
[2:04:22] shredder1111: solo shuffle is hard carrying wow pvp
[2:04:22] jaysixthree: solo shuffle saved wow pvp
[2:04:24] iamreallyafan: pvp is NOT  dying!! there's not a lot of players on because of SOD and classic wrath etc
[2:04:26] aurelioristv: Everyone benefits from more people participating in PvP including competitors
[2:04:29] SwedenBombSquad: coz ur playing whazz
[2:04:29] Deathmarkedx: shuffle is literally what saved pvp
[2:04:31] Guihufas: Why would you balance the game around the top 1% tho
[2:04:32] kuringg: another solution is to separate solo shuffle from real arena. you have 90sek trinket cd and low cc duration and all that shit there
[2:04:33] DipdabTwitch: @Pekara 2020 was covid
[2:04:36] eacherro: still, 20k for such huge game is garbage…
[2:04:38] ptwist_: viewer count =|= player
[2:04:44] Sobaze: utube also had around 4k viewers
[2:04:47] yoEliass: wait why not rmd
[2:04:48] EvgeshaAMG: MAN Kalvish is insane
[2:04:50] torkija: And you decide to lose for the first time ever before finals in front of that many ppl?? :D
[2:04:50] yoEliass: im confused
[2:04:52] KurosQt: friendship  power
[2:04:59] EmpStyle: Kanv diff

[2:05:13] Zurllyn: aaa a easy fuck u .....low rated playersss....PLAYER WITH FAMILY WITH JOBS ....KIDS  .wow is was not made just for streamers comn
[2:05:15] Deathmarkedx: @CheseX about 30k both twitch and YT
[2:05:17] hollow1zed: kubzy's arcane is a high dmg class though LUL
[2:05:19] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.
[2:05:19] EFFSIN: free promo by saying void.gg when its voidgg lol
[2:05:19] ripgodzx: why didnt you try dh warrior?
[2:05:19] voygard: u need to pve them and tax hard the blue bar
[2:05:22] asdkl2312k3o: its easy to stop arcane dmg now if u know how to do it
[2:05:23] Martem98: is splay good now?
[2:05:24] Sibble7: Or survive 11 minutes against high damage classes with rogue mage.  which means many drinks on druid lol.  just hard to play rmd
[2:05:25] rofffles: Feral?
[2:05:26] shredder1111: kalv is insane, gonna be interesting seeing how he does with more tourny xp
[2:05:30] aoespawn: ret? any good? Cupid
[2:05:37] aoespawn: hunters op
[2:05:41] slaughthemage: What about trying Frost Mage lock?
[2:05:42] juanmrbbnero: dh mage would beat them?
[2:05:46] juanmrbbnero: warr mage*
[2:05:50] rollinsthechamp: https://clips.twitch.tv/HandsomeHomelyWitchResidentSleeper-Slx8cR7eJSshmLx0
[2:05:56] EFFSIN: he tried 2 gate instead of port
[2:05:57] klittconny: Stop ads lol
[2:05:59] EmpStyle: @shredder1111 Honestly dont think he will compete for long, this seems to be a for fun thing for him
[2:06:00] maybethistimepls: priest
[2:06:01] Runeirl: think he plays rsham and hpala too?
[2:06:02] Neji513: i've seen him play priest in the past
[2:06:02] warlegend123: rogues
[2:06:03] EliasIsHere: @rollinsthechamp pls stop
[2:06:08] kreyzy8: hes been playing hpal recently
[2:06:12] rofffles: is Feral druid good bro ? whazz?
[2:06:36] Neji513: do you think it's troll of chun not playing diffuse magic?
[2:06:38] Elozern: darkness at 5%
[2:06:38] kreyzy8: dark did nothing LUL
[2:06:39] fuseton: he could just port back tho
[2:06:42] Draxe_tv: @rofffles every class/spec is good for casuals like u
[2:06:42] Elozern: big dh play
[2:06:57] kersell: why no port back
[2:06:57] murasuo: would you have 3-0’d every single team out there with Mehhx? or did it not matter that much
[2:07:10] kreyzy8: yeah that was v bad
[2:07:17] mysticalmoun: do you agree that cataclysm and pandaria were more about cc than burst? i think it was awesome expansions for pvp. i came on Dragonflight 3 months ago and its different game...
[2:07:22] Neji513: What do you think of chun not playing diffuse magic?
[2:07:31] spameris123: blizz should not make game easier, but more friendly for new players to start pvp. Like pvp training quests, better default UI etc..
[2:07:41] DCBen: he could have trinket
[2:07:45] DCBen: to stop refear
[2:07:50] DCBen: and maybe get ironbark of
[2:07:54] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Whaazz

[2:08:28] ripgodzx: when your pushing spells and there not going off until 1 sec after
[2:08:44] efram: Hei @Whaazz I havent played  since bfa, came back to df, enjoying sub rog but i see outlaws everywhere, is sub still playable? And how about the brag for having second weapon sword instead of dagger? Thanks <3
[2:08:46] voygard: loool i didnt saw the cast bar KEK
[2:08:50] ijantoptierghoul: kubzy coming in hot, reverse sweep inc
[2:09:04] Elozern: KUBZY LETS GOOO
[2:09:05] choca__: Since the beggining of the tournament, bunch of ppls lagged and lost brackets cause of that
[2:09:13] Sibble7: 150 ms is pretty unplayable yeah
[2:09:16] captoblivious12: lol no wonder everyone had precog today lol
[2:09:31] jugalosss: is the next tourny next week?
[2:09:34] pwntrd: 150ping doesn't make clones land at 70%, its prolly way more
[2:09:38] MitchFlori: what was the liquid vs move result
[2:09:45] murasuo: do you know if we get NA vs EU this time?
[2:09:45] Martem98: do they still do lan tournaments?
[2:09:47] ijantoptierghoul: kubzy damage is insane usually
[2:09:50] Zeneri: isnt kubzy resto druid?
[2:09:54] Waybetterr: @MitchFlori 3v1 liq
[2:09:55] Sibble7: i wonder if this was happening to pika too since samiyam had permanent precog lol
[2:10:00] kreyzy8: RMD is the comp they've been farming w/ on ladder
[2:10:05] animenjoyer: didn't chan play with more ping when he played in NA
[2:10:07] LyusinatoR: I am watching you for years now, you`re great guy but you hate to lose and you cant accept it with pride. Always have to explain some stuff... just tell the guys gg and pay some respect they read the comp
[2:10:07] klittconny: Kubzy got this

[2:12:03] connyrovoga: where does chanimal play from? whats his ping
[2:12:03] spoikkii: wait what? for real or just bs
[2:12:03] 122552096: does 1 roll decide the server location for every game in the series?
[2:12:08] Nephhx: Yeah putt it in the middle of the attlantic LUL
[2:12:11] murasuo: dudeeee that would’ve been so cool to see with mehh in it and luminosity….!!!!!
[2:12:12] rhymez_aut: @Whaazz why not just get all pro teams in a hotel for 3 days and do the tournament LAN ?????
[2:12:17] Shad_WW: its insane how they used to fly people to lans in poland and shit but now everybody is just fucked
[2:12:19] Tilidin: why cant they manipulate world ping to the players so everyone has shit ping
[2:12:21] Martem98: thats stupid
[2:12:22] chirsen: @Whaazz but why is it like that?
[2:12:22] EFFSIN: how does that work
[2:12:26] ASTROBERT_: east should be better ping for u guys no?
[2:12:28] IronlakPat: double melee lagging n winning more even impressive then lol
[2:12:29] Storm3n1: na eastcost is the side to eu
[2:12:30] Martem98: because blizzard is cheap
[2:12:31] 6ckines: Blizzard is to CHEAP
[2:12:31] buffevoker: Hell yeah we love cdad spanking EU ass
[2:12:33] aframpp: East should be better than west
[2:12:34] EFFSIN: are u playing with 80 ping rn

[2:12:42] chirsen: no i mean the ping thing
[2:12:55] yoEliass: yeah west is bad for u
[2:12:56] unsteddy: just fly to NA between games Kappa
[2:12:56] Nephhx: East is p layable yeah
[2:12:57] Sibble7: Why not put all of you on taiwan or something
[2:12:58] sxxicute: too expensive. multi billionaire company btw
[2:12:58] aframpp: Yeah west you'll be on 200
[2:12:59] Martem98: why no lan games in blizzcon
[2:12:59] code_rage: blizzard should put a server in Cuba every one with 2k ping
[2:13:00] rollinsthechamp: Because NA cant accept that EU>NA and EU has to smack them every time again to prove it
[2:13:00] KoN778: how did lontar die against the warr/dh when he barked at like > 80%
[2:13:07] Ponycopter: where can I check what gear people are using? want to chec kthe balance druid that just played earlier
[2:13:08] b77ar: killingspree viable?
[2:13:09] KoN778: could you have done anything?
[2:13:19] Promocodebaj: they steal money from players that was for competitors. they’re not paying for a hotel for everyone every comp
[2:13:21] jaysixthree: find the mage
[2:13:24] Tilidin: cant world ping be edited by blizz? so everyone shit ping
[2:13:29] spoikkii: Guess its time for u guys to practice with NA accs for that
[2:13:38] 6ckines: Blizzard Wants View count but wants to try to scrap some half assed tourney together, OTK Tourney vs Blizzard AWC how sad
[2:13:50] truhan89: what do u think about ur rmd games today
[2:13:51] Martem98: could you use Exitlag for better ping?
[2:13:53] linuswarlock: bro den der echo tweet af raiku defeat KEKW 👎
[2:13:55] shredder1111: indian tech support was right all along??
[2:14:09] A6iyx: wtfast or pingzapper
[2:14:15] Nephhx: Works marginally tbh
[2:14:20] asdkl2312k3o: the TR ping is just UI bug
[2:14:22] chirsen: blizzard should do his server in the middle of the atlantic so the ping should be the same for na and eu or? :D
[2:14:28] Dyssyx: exitlag is the same thing as just closing all the apps on your PC that use any network traffic
[2:14:32] asdkl2312k3o: KEKL
[2:14:50] Typh93: did chan tell you he put raiku echo thumbs down pic as his wallpaper?
[2:14:52] EFFSIN: Do u think lontar deserves a ultra bacon today
[2:14:53] Sajko33: Exitlag = placebo
[2:14:56] Waybetterr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnyW2WeO9qs what happne with this format of games i didnt know how to explain so ilinked this 2019 match
[2:15:06] Martem98: @Dyssyx i think exitlag reroutes your network
[2:15:08] voygard: yes
[2:15:15] code_rage: A ping is the response time from a network package from your device to the server, so any network interference could affect the ping
[2:15:16] gfknw: no f lontar
[2:15:18] fatulina: pika vs kubzy 1st i guess then kalvish cdew
[2:15:37] Loadedmvp: @Whaazz just order him VEGE ultra bacon LUL
[2:15:37] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.

[2:20:33] hiraad12: Its so troll that you have to win most games as rmp on mana aswell atm
[2:20:42] DestructibleTimes: @Whaazz They nerfed backdraft generation by conflagrate. And instant incenerates eat 1 backdraft charge, makes it reaaaaly shitty to cast chaos bolts and rifts are too slow to get a kill in a set up, this is what my Lock friend is telling me xD

[2:21:28] Lilithay: much love to you <3 but iam happy there is some Contestants... oftyen not be there

[2:22:41] Ambuttv: kalv
[2:22:42] hillybilly_jim: pika ez
[2:22:43] torkija: 3-2 kalvish
[2:22:46] sirius_sx: Can you try playing ret/warr/rsham against holy priest team
[2:22:49] Sibble7: Kalvish is probably better than pika at outlaw though
[2:22:50] Murixtv: pika
[2:22:51] Delxenyo: Who do you think is gonna win Echo or Jaime playing atm a 3s game
[2:22:54] Mood1001: dude the move has been playing outta their minds
[2:22:56] Erissgoddes: Hopefully KALVISH WINS!
[2:22:57] thecandyshopowner: Kalv is pretty decent rn
[2:22:57] g1loaded: Voidgg looking so good right now think the move is going to get a hard game
[2:23:02] r1zzlaplus: kalv

[2:23:50] KoN778: what do you think of venruki suggesting demo lock against ww?
[2:23:57] torkija: in this damp meta i think raiku frost and chan demo would win on mana everytime today
[2:23:59] aod0311x: Pika is better at sub but I don't think he beats kalvish as outlaw. Familiarity and enjoyment of the spec matters and I feel like alot of you rogues are playing outlaw not because you like it but because it's better than sub.
[2:24:07] Zeneri: why didnt you bring on raiku on dh or something?
[2:24:14] asdkl2312k3o: think shaman is better with R/L rn
