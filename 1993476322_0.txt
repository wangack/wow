[2:38:41] dogebakar: What would get you to give retail a try again?

[2:39:50] n00batplay: warrior was my go-to in vanilla <3

[2:42:36] n00batplay: yeah, i don't know really why, but with Chris Metzen back at Blizzard, I AM cautiously Optimistic
[2:42:37] Daelaron86: the good thing in dragonflight I would say is open world solo content, there is SO much

[2:44:26] kappyshammy: unpopular opinion but I think thats a nostalgia vfiew. I think they just need to continue the current story but write it well. I wouldn't want to lose Legion's story for example

[2:50:57] Big_Headed_Gamer: danP
[2:50:59] Grumpy_tiger: feel like Cata will kill the player count a bit
[2:51:02] menulo: yea, loads of olf guildies are on wrath, kinda sad i missed it in hinfsight
[2:51:03] Xaedrik32: Wasn't it like 11 or 12 million
[2:51:04] Charchon: Dansplaining
[2:51:06] starzha: sadge
[2:51:09] ghsteo: they changed the world and ruined nostalgia
[2:51:12] jackalo34: @jikan1916 i mean its not perfect but neither is retail
[2:51:32] Big_Headed_Gamer: chat, you all acting like they aren't working on cata revamps where they went wrong danGnome
[2:51:33] charbx0r: Didn't it get to 13 million subs during Wrath?
[2:51:38] n00batplay: my Favorite still is MOP <3
[2:51:39] BossaSuperNova: Isn't Wrath going away when Cata Classic drops?
[2:51:44] jikan1916: nah, I don't stan for either version. @jackalo34 I just hold each as flawed
[2:51:56] jolf: Raggy 10 man HC was really cool, rest of expansion was meh
[2:52:01] Charchon: People can't wait to take on Deathwing's fingers again
[2:52:01] menulo: first season of cata was amazing tbh, great dungeons, great zones, good raid
[2:52:09] Daelaron86: they have a blank slate to change the world again with cata classic
[2:52:13] tenthousand: cataclysm might seem OK after all the other trash weve been through LUL
[2:52:14] altie1: None of the expansions are perfect, far from it. But I do enjoy a lot of QoL stuff they added in the expansions along the years
[2:52:15] Gentlesideoffury: Ho-ho-ho-hi dan and chat!
[2:52:15] menulo: kinda whent downhill after that
[2:52:17] bob_3002: Maybe they'll make a Classic 2 after Cataclysm hits Classic danOld
[2:52:19] jikan1916: Cata was so good for revitalizing lots of those dead zones
[2:52:30] kokochris: still got classic hc
[2:52:31] Reesiekups: Is it worth getting into WoW Classic as a straight up n00b?
[2:52:39] 000000000000000000_CSLUL: wow wod classic Prayge
[2:52:42] jackalo34: @jikan1916 i gold everything as flawed but classic has more soul thab retail so i think thats a big part of y ppl love it. i kno i did n its nt nostalgia bc i only started wow in bc
[2:52:44] kokochris: @Reesiekups for sure you can
[2:52:45] jikan1916: @Reesiekups for sure
[2:52:48] charbx0r: I mean Cata system revamps but give us like Wrath+ talent trees. @dansgaming
[2:52:52] CptTeempo: RareDan
[2:52:57] Reesiekups: Screw it, I'm just gonna start.
[2:52:57] CptTeempo: RareDan Same Music in Every Inn RareDan
[2:53:02] Rewrench: they really should have left some servers at BC and some at Wrath permanently. they should have few servers to spare for paying customers
[2:53:03] Daelaron86: What I would really want, or have wanted for years is WoW2, actual tabula rasa, new beginnings
[2:53:04] Eraste: ya just go for it, classic is a super super easy game
[2:53:18] Reesiekups: @kokochris @jikan1916 and @DansGaming Thanks, ya'll!
[2:53:20] jackalo34: @CptTeempo RareDan u r consistent
[2:53:21] menulo: @000000000000000000_CSLUL man i miss sitting at me missions table, good times
[2:53:24] jikan1916: @jackalo34 I been playing on and off since Open Beta - left FFXI for it
[2:53:26] CptTeempo: jackalo34 danP
[2:53:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Reesiekups that's the best way to go into anything
[2:53:28] Gentlesideoffury: I miss this game!
[2:53:56] menulo: classic MoP might actually be fun though, great expansion
[2:53:59] TurtleSwisss: danChat
[2:54:00] Eraste: chat, should i play monster hunter world or tears of the kingdom tonight? danHmm
[2:54:07] Reesiekups: @Big_Headed_Gamer Truth
[2:54:07] Daelaron86: danChat
[2:54:21] n00batplay: Old Ironforge <3
[2:54:28] altie1: Since my guild ruined raiding by the ending of wotlk that expansion will always leave a bad taste in my mouth. I now enjoy casual pug raids/rage.
[2:54:28] jackalo34: @jikan1916 it was one of my first if not my first mmo thst my brother introduced to me in high school. b4 i only played ps2 games
[2:54:34] Reesiekups: Reesiekups gifted a Tier 1 sub to jikan1916! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[2:54:34] EtruriaK: Whats ur favorite wow expansion cinematic Dan?
[2:54:40] Bastid: I can't play wow as much as I use to, I get wrist fatigue in my mouse hand really bad
[2:54:44] jackalo34: @Eraste yes
[2:54:48] jikan1916: when people say retail, they are forgetting that so much is still in game from old xpacs
[2:54:51] charbx0r: @eraste MHW. Super satisfying
[2:54:56] jikan1916: @Reesiekups Thanks!
[2:55:01] charbx0r: "My son"
[2:55:01] Eraste: @jackalo34 danKEK2
[2:55:03] altie1: "You are not prepared"
[2:55:05] Eraste: @charbx0r done danNodders
[2:55:08] Big_Headed_Gamer: danS
[2:55:10] Xaedrik32: Yes, without a doubt
[2:55:12] luka_khemin: Dan! What did you think of the Fallout series trailer that came out today?
[2:55:12] SekretAznMan: true NODDERS
[2:55:14] heavymetalhorns: Vanilla WoW will always hold such a special, nostalgic place in my heart. I fondly remember Sundays, lunch with the family and then WoW for the rest of the day danOld
[2:55:17] rufflad: same, the song is so sick too
[2:55:17] charbx0r: "No king rules forever."
[2:55:20] altie1: Illidan!
[2:55:21] Eraste: BFA is my favorite but im a sylvanas simp (still)
[2:55:31] Daelaron86: The day you were born, the very forests of twitch whispered the name ... Paladan
[2:55:32] tenthousand: @Bastid i had same problem, started playing 1handed by binding turn to shift+a/d and just stopping and using my left hand to click on loot/quests
[2:55:36] Reesiekups: @jikan1916 Nah, thank YOU, buddy! Enjoy the gifted!
[2:55:38] Hardlessdaimio: NODDERS and everyone trys to sing the wrath intro song
[2:55:44] Machian: what? not the slapstick sequence with the fat kung-fu panda???
[2:55:52] jackalo34: @Eraste i loved sylvanas till they destroyed wat made her cool
[2:56:06] charbx0r: Deathwing Cinematic is actually decent tbh
[2:56:12] jikan1916: @Reesiekups I appreciate it! I usually just lurk but WoW is mah jam
[2:56:16] Eraste: @jackalo34 ya that was rough, but i still like her. but ya, comparing the legion her to after... oof, howd they screw that one up
[2:56:25] altie1: Sylvanas was a badass you couldn't fully agree with but understand. Then she goes off the rails writing style
[2:56:35] jackalo34: yep
[2:56:41] RedNameInDisguise: any cinematic with sylvanas is bad
[2:56:47] Reesiekups: @jikan1916 I just downloaded a few seconds ago. Here we go!
[2:56:48] jackalo34: i think i liked her more bc she wasnt up front n center
[2:56:51] wtfblub: cheesing KEKW
[2:57:01] Eraste: lament of the highborne song danGachi x10
[2:57:02] Daelaron86: yeah the cinematic team does wonders... i even like the ones for shadowlands, and I abhor that abomination of an expansion
[2:57:02] jikan1916: take your time and enjoy! @Reesiekups
[2:57:07] Hardlessdaimio: PrideLaugh
[2:57:24] jikan1916: @Daelaron86 Shadowlands gameplay ended fun but yeah the story was.....weird
[2:57:27] altie1: Yes the ppl behind the cinematics are legends
[2:57:40] Eraste: i remember doing that lament of the highborne quest the first time in tbc, i listened to it and just sat there for like an hour listening to other people turn it in
[2:57:54] jikan1916: even the MoP cinamatic was crazy good
[2:57:58] Is_Only_Game: like osrs danSgame
[2:58:00] Daelaron86: @jikan1916 it definitely jumped the shark
[2:58:05] jikan1916: lol @Daelaron86
[2:58:09] jackalo34: @Is_Only_Game yep
[2:58:13] jikan1916: story felt very forced
[2:58:22] Machian: boys be RPin
[2:58:23] Grumpy_tiger: I think with Retail to, there's just so much now.. so many reps, so many mounts, so many toys.. it all kind of loses it's value.
[2:58:24] EddyStylez: maybe they will learn from classic and improve retail for once
[2:59:00] lem10: LUL
[2:59:09] Daelaron86: @A1chera they did that with talents, so there is some hoping OKAY
[2:59:11] LeBigNose: ding!
[2:59:13] Necronicon: makes me want to roll on a rp server
[2:59:16] LeBigNose: hip hip hoorraay
