[0:00:20] SupR3m3PriM3: "Give me a second, guys," Soda says. "Gotta hit up the bathroom" He turns down the volume on his microphone, and immediately gives the birds a swift kick down. As the birds yelps loudly in pain, Soda overturns the nearest chair, yelling "Fuck this game!" as loudly as he can. Vei tries to calm him down, but Soda swiftly bodyslams her onto a glass coffee table. After taking a few deep breaths, Soda wipes the blood off of his face, sits back down at his computer, and resumes his sponsored stream.

[0:01:21] SupR3m3PriM3: Imagine being a lacari fan. You like his content and want to do something nice. You spend weeks learning to make indie games. You design a fan-game in the style of 999 because he likes that series. You tirelessly make fun puzzles. It has funny dialog. You proudly publish the game. Then lacari ignores you for months, ever-promising to play it, aad infinitum.
