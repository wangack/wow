[3:25:16] TodeMKD: NICEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:25:32] TodeMKD: SO its like 1 month 1 and half maybe NICEEE
[3:26:03] ittrick: they have changed that timeline a few times already tho
[3:26:15] karl__91: it'll be June
[3:26:23] karl__91: pre patch maybe may
[3:26:26] TodeMKD: i wanted to say about prepatch :)
[3:26:43] Fujicakess: they're going to stagger p3 SoD and then bring in cata when its slow
[3:27:00] ittrick: p2 sod is indeed going to be looong
[3:27:13] TodeMKD: btw, will they leave WOTLK or all chars going to be transfered to CATA and wotlk will be closed? :/
[3:27:32] Fujicakess: it'll prob be lvl 50 around mid may?
[3:27:50] TodeMKD: :/
[3:28:15] bonyato: peepoSad
[3:28:15] TodeMKD: yess yess
[3:28:27] Fujicakess: i think they got too much backlash with copying chars and charging

[3:28:38] jazetrum: @Fujicakess hoping for some time in april

[3:36:26] karl__91: @hazzard02 this makes sense
[3:36:35] Fujicakess: well they added SSF to existing HC servers so it was doomed from the beginning
