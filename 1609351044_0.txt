[1:22:08] Hammybone: Kaivax Community Manager #1 - Oct. 4, 2022, 8:39 p.m. Blizzard Post With the first Arena season starting this week, we are reducing the cost of Honor gear by 30%.  During the first week of the expansion there were some very profitable ways of earning Honor which have been resolved. With this change, players who are reaching level 80 this week will be able to acquire Deadly, Hateful, and Savage gear a bit more quickly, to prepare for Arena play.  This update is coming via hotfix soon.
