[0:27:06] TotallyNotRaien: would it be called rustic?
[0:27:22] yolohans123: this is the kind of floor you like to read a book on
[0:27:38] silentstorm0533: darker floors are 100x cozier i fell better in a room with a dark floor rather than a super white floor
[0:27:40] Kuroz: :d
[0:27:41] Deenial: I like walls and flooring which darkens a room because it gives more power to lights and moodlights change the vibe however you choose
[0:27:50] janestefanowsky006: that looks prety wild
[0:27:57] Huvva: Dark academia classic
[0:27:58] hideo1984: I have that floor, make sure you carpenter is good. it’s difficult to get it right with have the corners get messed up

[0:29:11] DjUrsu: is this made out of compressed sawdust ?
[0:29:17] Ozorian30: the only thing that isnt really nice about the darker floor is that dust can be seen on it even after a day, so be prepared to having to clean it a lot. price of looking really neat i guess
[0:30:09] restobae: bit too  dark for me, but happy you like it! :D

[3:35:21] Dreclador: lol playing this music makes the vid seem like a meme clown fiesta or something. I'm waiting for the punchline where someone makes a big mistake
[3:35:22] Curryz_: pointing like we can see them KEKW
[3:35:42] Sebleh: @dreclador that’s the thing. the stream is always a meme clown fiesta

[3:37:08] vikutoru11: Good morning naguuraLove
[3:37:11] chubbytheboi: Where priest dps?
[3:37:27] Sebleh: sheet music vs instrument tabs is like the difference between actually knowing your spec/rotation vs just following what the guide says
[3:37:37] Kuroz: CatDriving @vikutoru11
[3:37:42] crawnpocktail: i just use sheet and you end up remembering it anyway
[3:38:02] Sebleh: sheet music requires knowing the notes and translating them in your brain as you read them. tabs is like “press these buttons/strings/keys in this order”
[3:38:28] crawnpocktail: ehhh, might be good to get a few lessons just to get you started
[3:38:37] toymakerwarrior: learning curve with accordion is left hand
[3:38:40] crawnpocktail: but teaching yourself is super fun anyways
[3:38:54] crawnpocktail: @toymakerwarrior she's playing buttons on both side apparently
[3:38:55] toymakerwarrior: because you cant see it, so you have to "memorise" it by feeling
[3:39:00] Quickside55: i think you can call it partiture too
[3:39:04] toymakerwarrior: i know, i play accordion for 20 years
[3:39:52] Quickside55: sounds better than sheet music xd
[3:40:06] crawnpocktail: i much prefer piano accordion ngl, feels a lot nicer doing hte melody
[3:40:21] crawnpocktail: if you have any piano exp its pretty easy
[3:40:36] Neysee: !song

[3:55:46] devilleboi: i laughed so hard at this clip
[3:55:59] Dreclador: ya this boss is also just pain
[3:56:12] devilleboi: they nerfed this boss tho
[3:56:16] Garfo87: Hey u gir :) doint forget to repair
[3:56:16] StreamElements: Repair this wideASS
[3:56:26] devilleboi: u strafe ya
[3:56:26] Sebleh: you just run straight yeah
[3:56:41] Sebleh: they changed this boss btw the cones don’t trigger the melee hit buff now on the boss
[3:56:45] Dreclador: backpetalling is actually a really good speed for it
[3:56:47] Sebleh: supposedly
[3:57:18] devilleboi: yeah u can kick the archers
[3:57:24] devilleboi: the axe throwers need stun
[3:57:31] Sebleh: yeah that sounds like what he said
[3:57:33] devilleboi: but this boss is a joke now
[3:57:58] Sebleh: yeah you can tank in the middle now right @devilleboi ?
[3:58:13] devilleboi: no he still gets the pulsing stacks if he hits the adds tho
[3:58:17] Dreclador: @Sebleh When did they change this?
[3:58:19] devilleboi: just not as punishing if he gets stacks
[3:58:27] Sebleh: last night
[3:58:41] Sebleh: https://www.wowhead.com/news/mythic-dungeon-hotfixes-removed-randomness-and-bug-fixes-337730
[3:58:54] Dreclador: Whirlwind still does it right?
[3:58:55] Sebleh: Addressed an issue where Battle Senses can trigger from Shockwave.
[3:59:02] Sebleh: yeah whirlwind does but the cones dont
[3:59:10] Sebleh: unless I’m not understanding it correctly
[3:59:56] aant02: probably have just enough
[3:59:59] Dreclador: Mmm... cones triggering the Battle Senses seems different than cones building stacks
[4:00:07] rackaretwc: last boss takes max 5 min, its pretty scripted because of the buffs you recieve from the dragons
[4:00:16] el_scorcho82: flicker would be nice to have back during blade storm
[4:01:13] Andersonmps: How was the valentine dinner yesterday? (Sorry, i was late and missed the review)
[4:01:38] F1c1cA: @rackaretwc not really 5 on  27 :)
[4:01:52] Sebleh: so you fokatchad up the fokatcha?
[4:01:57] Dreclador: @Sebleh Mmm I think you actually do have to keep cones off hte adds still
[4:02:03] devilleboi: watch my clip after ur key naguura, its dumb but it made me laugh so hard
[4:02:05] rackaretwc: ye closer to 4 mins i guess
[4:02:16] Andersonmps: LUL
[4:02:20] Dreclador: There must have been an issue wheere the cone would actually trigger the debuff damage to fire
[4:02:22] Sebleh: fokatcha dn
[4:02:30] Andersonmps: Adding to the italian bread lore
[4:02:36] Sebleh: @dreclador yeah it sounds like it would say “granting stacks” you’re right
[4:03:01] Dreclador: It's a really weird debuff too. Very convoluted
[4:03:43] devilleboi: devilleboi: no he still gets the pulsing stacks if he hits the adds tho @Sebleh i said it earlier
[4:03:44] teamblacklist3d: I like your music
[4:03:51] Andersonmps: This RP is soo long
[4:03:57] Sebleh: @devilleboi ThumbsUpCat
[4:04:03] teamblacklist3d: Ever heard of Tyler Childers ?
[4:04:20] devilleboi: i suspect he could pulse a stack during cones last time but now cant like what @Dreclador said
[4:04:26] Kim_Wu: Paid actor
[4:04:37] teamblacklist3d: Xm

[4:11:40] devilleboi: i told u its dumb
[4:12:26] therealkhorrn: At the last boss in P2 when he comes down you were stacking in the middle. Wouldn't it be better to start at the outside/wall?
[4:12:46] devilleboi: no but for real naguura im trying to get a fyrakk heart after seeing how the hunters have started using it to live higher keys, gonna let u know if it works out
[4:12:58] Sebleh: Wow you uploaded an actual thumbnail for your youtube stream today?

[4:13:32] question_m: question_m subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! 
[4:13:34] cyrokas: you can record from radio
[4:13:40] Kuroz: naguuraLove naguuraLove naguuraLove
[4:13:40] MasterNewt: You buy a cassette and then you go back in 1985 and record it.
[4:13:40] Andersonmps: Recording the song with the tape recorder
[4:13:45] Sebleh: Pretty sure it's just like a microphone jack for the audio input
[4:13:53] devilleboi: yes the good ones have microphone jack
[4:13:59] devilleboi: so u get a two way audio jack cable
[4:14:04] Sebleh: so you can probably just find a way to output your PC to a recorder
[4:14:06] Lenietwitch: cassette recorders will have a jack mic input
[4:14:08] sim967: in high school I had a dual cassette recorder
[4:14:29] 3verythingatonce: smaller onboard cameras have mic jacs
[4:14:32] Sebleh: Naguura
[4:14:35] Andersonmps: Jack your pc directly
[4:14:42] devilleboi: @Naguura no use a two way audio jack cable, one in the input of ur pc and the second in the mic input of the recorder
[4:14:49] Dreclador: Make sure you get a top quality recording. It's very important for these gag gifts
[4:14:51] 3verythingatonce: they also make xlr to mic jack cables
[4:14:58] Sebleh: I'm sure they have stuff to do that now from modern PCs
[4:15:54] devilleboi: @Naguura get a male to male audio cable and do waht i mentioned above for perfect recording
[4:16:01] Dreclador: the old tape recorders had their own microphone
[4:16:07] Kuroz: old ones had it ye
[4:16:45] devilleboi: mic will have mic quality, u can get perfect by using male to male audio cable
[4:16:48] 3verythingatonce: yes
[4:16:50] devilleboi: yes that one
[4:16:52] devilleboi: thats a male to male
[4:17:13] Andersonmps: Search for cassette usb converter
[4:17:18] Andersonmps: on amazon
[4:17:25] devilleboi: why ur pc should have an audio jack to plug into right
[4:17:34] devilleboi: then u plug the other side into the casette's input
[4:17:35] devilleboi: done
