[4:40:10] N3llee: I feel like RWF in general kinda hangs in the balance. Peach talked a bit yesterday on his channel about the new RWF meta being 3 days splits and 2 days of prog it may no longer be cost effective to continue doing the race as it has been done.
[4:40:15] Treevinal: Archers have no aggro table, that is why they are prio
[4:40:41] honeybadger1113: theres always drama lol
[4:40:58] N3llee: Echo might retire if they lose this with this new meta stuff
[4:41:03] TheeCableguy: The funny part is they set themselves up for worse bc they trolled and said they were live from NA xD

[4:42:36] TheeCableguy: It's lose lose. Its masses vs the top .2%
[4:42:43] N3llee: Without a global release and now the Raids no longer being tuned for the RWF (races last a week or less)
[4:42:53] sklingel: rwf kinda lame nowadays so many people helping outside the guild
[4:42:54] devilhawk83: I got a feeling Blizzard doesn‚Äôt really care as much as people think as RWF is more of a community thing than a Blizzard runned thing
[4:43:02] N3llee: Its just not cost effective
[4:43:07] N3llee: for either team
[4:43:14] Nixel_: What if they do what destiny does and release the raid on a Friday regardless of the weekly reset
[4:43:21] BRUTALIT0PS: I still think doing it on a PTR like server just for RWF is the best idea, but it'd ruin splits and stuff like that so there is no real good solution to it

[4:43:49] kokochris: @Nixel_ I was saying the same thing. Not sure why thats a bad thing
[4:43:51] EfnetLemons: its like santa coming to austrailia  first before north america

[4:44:46] Calphurnious: @EfnetLemons Magic
[4:44:47] BRUTALIT0PS: Very true
[4:44:53] Svennisele: was the RESET for EU moved to tuesday wouldnt be a issue
[4:44:56] N3llee: Doesnt matter the new Meta for RWF is 3 days splits 2-3 day prog means its not worth the effort nor the cost from either teams. It worse for Echo cause they start a day behind.
[4:45:09] Lazarenth: server would be down during their primetime i think
[4:45:15] N3llee: @Svennisele no, global raid release thats ut
[4:45:19] N3llee: it*

[4:46:05] devilhawk83: If there is enough community backlash, Blizzard might do simultaneous release, but if there is not enough backlash then Blizzard doesn‚Äôt feel there is a big need of doing a simultaneous release for all regions for the WoW patches
[4:46:32] EfnetLemons: there are only 2 affixes showing
[4:46:49] Sollice: @devilhawk83 There has been community backlast for literal years
[4:46:53] Sollice: Nothing has chnaged
[4:47:24] TheeCableguy: Okay good now we can do an 18 rise xD
[4:48:11] RageerPLZ: I have 23 waycrest manor, still no branch, we go AGAIN
[4:48:27] N3llee: WoW has been #1 on twitch all week
[4:48:33] brormin_: I returned due to rwf looked fun
[4:48:35] EfnetLemons: jajajajajaja
[4:48:36] N3llee: between race and HC its cooking
[4:48:52] ThePawPaw: GandalfPls
[4:49:02] Colt_Engineer: I'm sorry, is it simple?
[4:49:08] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee I think you are wrong, the amount of people that care about the RWF... is so small.
[4:50:08] BRUTALIT0PS: I haven't even done a dungeon yet for DF LUL
[4:50:10] Niksen_99: Are you still not hyped for the race LUL
[4:50:31] sklingel: otk makgora tourney had 10 times the viewers as rwf
[4:50:58] TheeCableguy: echo is pulling rn
[4:51:06] TheeCableguy: 1st pull already 43% and going
[4:51:08] ThePawPaw: @Towelliee asking for a friend can i come on my hunter 425 :)
[4:51:16] TheeCableguy: 42% wipe
[4:51:21] Niksen_99: Yeah echo 2nd pull on smolderon its already 43% lol
[4:51:32] tehrobtar: the drama is always great after rwf
[4:51:43] DankedOne_: I just came back after skipping Shadowlands, feeling a bit overwhelmed.. towCry
[4:51:52] Brandishblade: I only cared about the racess when it involves unlocking the end cinematics. now that thats gone im not interested. just me tho
[4:51:53] Svennisele: if the RWF was not streamed, would be 100% US win over EU by far
[4:51:56] ThePawPaw: @tehrobtar yup the not global release 5-6 hours drama love it LUL

[4:53:49] TheeCableguy: whoiever is in the lead paves the way for everyone else to try and leap frog
[4:53:52] N3llee: @Svennisele kind of a bad take.

[4:54:29] Rudric_Ice: did method change their name or something lol ? i dont see them on the leaderboards
[4:54:38] Vohodian: Without sponsorship from Streaming, US raiders would not get the $ to take off their IRL jobs to compete. Yeah NA WF kills were rare before sponsorships.

[4:55:32] Bowwjack: @Towelliee tbh i think that the raid should be on a global release
[4:55:44] Colt_Engineer: that weakaura is awesome
[4:55:54] Strifelol: Where it is safe
[4:55:58] Rudric_Ice: time to ban that
[4:56:01] faeria30: It looks like it tells them the safe zone to go to
[4:56:03] Strifelol: Pog WA

[4:59:15] devilhawk83: Not happening
[4:59:15] ThePawPaw: who ECHO or Liquid?
[4:59:33] EfnetLemons: is there a betting site online for us to bet who will win
[4:59:36] N3llee: I think if they lose and global release doesnt happen... Echo will 100% retire.
[4:59:37] Lilurrn: Liquid goated for having their entire team at facility though
[4:59:40] Keyastaron_: XD
[4:59:45] FrankTizzle: Why though? They've won several before last tier
[5:00:07] iccyc0ld: But they still get visibility because of the race. So sponsors are still happy
[5:00:10] TheeCableguy: You excited for NFL games this week?
[5:00:18] OldMan_Pappy: Liquid has a 1.0 advantage in iLvl, is there that much of a difference in the gear to say it's a huge factor in success?
[5:00:29] JeemTeam: gloom and doom fear mongering around RWF
[5:00:41] PigPenLen: @FrankTizzle we live in an all or nothing world man
[5:00:57] N3llee: @FrankTizzle Because Blizz is no longer tuning raids for the 1%. Which ultimately means raids will be a bit easier and less bosses which means clears happen the first week.
[5:01:03] neverbornlucky: Towelliee that is why we call them huntards
[5:01:33] TheeCableguy: that WA reminds me of Fatescribe
[5:01:49] Keyastaron_: pog i got on a doomer phase Kappa
[5:01:50] Lilurrn: liquid even fucked up their split with nick and he still came out good
[5:01:53] N3llee: both guilds ran splits for the first 3 days so the ilvl should be a huge difference
[5:02:06] Dragunstorm15: I thought i saw on echo's stream that liquid has like 5 pulls or somethin?

[5:03:11] Keyastaron_: 440 LUL
[5:03:13] TheeCableguy: Im saved but will come in on fyrak if you need. Not saved with him.
[5:03:13] abbott012: xD
