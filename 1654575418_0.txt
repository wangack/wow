[10:42:06] Pallyofhell: my fire breath was critting for 163k
[10:42:10] Cryptmaker123: true, I can see that
[10:42:32] Cryptmaker123: yea fire breath does insane dmg atm
[10:42:35] unknownbudz: i got hit for 39k fire breath in arena
[10:42:47] Cryptmaker123: same
[10:42:49] monk_ver_2: @Mikaroen oh that one. 1.8 in rbg wont be a problem if you know how to pvp
[10:42:51] Cryptmaker123: took half my hp as rogue xD
[10:43:04] jdallr00: Every blue spell slows as dps you spec into it
[10:43:21] Mikaroen: Is it 1800 rating nomatter what pvp or only rbgs ? I thought it was only rbgs

[10:44:47] jdallr00: Also as dps don’t go full empowered on spells the dots are huge at lvl 1
[10:45:02] monk_ver_2: @Mikaroen rbgs are more about team play, communication, income and deff, but wont be a problem for you
[10:45:13] Pallyofhell: mastery as the dps spec sims better for dmg than vers
[10:45:13] Cryptmaker123: empowering is only good to spread on more adds in pve
[10:45:25] RyfenVII: You playing preservation?
[10:45:28] Cryptmaker123: if u fully empower breath it does instant dmg instead of overtime
[10:45:36] Pallyofhell: no
[10:45:47] Pallyofhell: breath still does a overtime
[10:45:48] Souliie: yo
[10:45:51] Pallyofhell: at max rank
[10:45:56] Pallyofhell: just shorter duration
[10:45:58] Cryptmaker123: shorter
[10:46:05] Cryptmaker123: but does more instant dmg
[10:46:06] Pallyofhell: thats why its best to do max rank on short fights
