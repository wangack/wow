[6:46:51] Creoxx: monkaHeliWatchesWidePeepoHappySmokesWhileRunningOverCivilansOfChicagoAndFatDankPeepoIsAlsoThereToo
[6:47:01] zqitv: Exactly
[6:47:25] athania01: at least they made it an immunity buff
[6:47:37] athania01: and only 20sec
[6:47:52] athania01: yeah
[6:48:02] athania01: you get immunity and ppl cant see you
[6:48:05] athania01: for 20 secs
[6:48:33] athania01: i suppose you cant see others aswell
[6:48:38] rogerview: !roll
[6:48:38] Nightbot: rogerview rolls 12 (1-100)
[6:48:40] athania01: couldnt figure it out from the wording
[6:48:44] zack68: you can see others as long as they dont have the buff too
[6:48:47] Creoxx: would be a bit strong if you could tho lul
[6:49:07] Creoxx: just respawn as 5 at the same time and 1shot some poor pleb after the 20 seconds
[6:49:23] athania01: Additionally, this effect will now also grant a pacify and invisibility effect so that players can resurrect and then move away from graveyards/chained spirits, mount up, summon pets, and more effectively “reset” after a combat to prepare for the next fight.
[6:50:06] athania01: Players who resurrect in Stranglethorn Vale during the Blood Moon event and gain Drained of Blood will now be immune to attack during its duration, but unable to cast spells or attack. They can mount and move to another location and are invisible to players outside their party. Drained of Blood duration reduced to 20 seconds (was 60 seconds).
[6:50:26] Snooqzz_: kinda sad the mace from stb is a mace Sadge
[6:50:36] Snooqzz_: useless for pve
[6:51:27] athania01: and invisible to players outside the party
[6:51:43] athania01: but from this wording it seems that others are not invisible to you
[6:51:47] Creoxx: "They can mount and move to another location" unless you are prefox xff where mount
[6:52:02] athania01: greghar1 is here, go get wulf
[6:52:45] athania01: send gold to athaniasmorc for Prefoxie's monte :)
