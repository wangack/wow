[2:26:41] BDNJ_BoBoDaMan: bro watching your stream with coffee is to relaxing for morning time
[2:26:42] PvtHudson093: Blizz could make a new AH mount
[2:26:43] stallowned: id do that lol.
[2:26:43] Artemisthemp: I gift you 8 Towellie, but then you better throw in a Tuskar

[2:27:51] Eviltuna13: Alliance will get Tuskar and Horde will get Gnolls crreamHm

[3:49:22] gelimarr: Polestar is reaally good
[3:49:24] xX_Vanq_Xx: @towelliee it's only faster off the line, above 100, you will get destroyed by a gas car
[3:49:24] Liquid_vsop: Rivian!
[3:49:25] DrakeDuude: idk that 5.0 coyote engine on the gt is really baller
[3:49:30] yeahuhh: quicker not faster
[3:49:32] xX_Vanq_Xx: @fruity_pebbles2018 yes it is lol
[3:49:36] RockemSockem0821: F-150 Lightning is pretty cool
[3:49:36] MWilco77: Rivian is legit though
[3:49:37] meltingcheese17: i just love the honda civic
[3:49:47] Samiccus: GM <3
[3:49:53] Tripl3dot: I think Polestars are kinda cool
[3:49:57] Cower311: electric cars in racing are like a different weight class of boxing. its unfair to compete again combustion just becasue of the insane acceleration
[3:50:06] manmower: hondas are pretty legit, but i would take an accord over civic, the more luxurious model
[3:50:07] gelimarr: I prefer japanese made cars
[3:50:17] stallowned: those dual motor teslas are insane fast. faster than some super cars
[3:50:23] Samiccus: Hummer EV halls ass and is as heavy as a tank lol
[3:50:24] HaxzorJimDuggan: ive got 16 more payments on my car and im gonna drive that shit until it falls apart

[3:50:28] BuffiDoinks: A gt-350 ot gt-500 will beat a Mach-e in a 1/4 mile
[3:50:28] Liquid_vsop: I like the Mach-e just felt like I was too big for the car. and didnt like the lack of trunk space.
[3:50:31] DadKnowz: Can someone explain the actual benefit to EV? Strip mining for heavy metals to make batteries and then charging the EV with coal energy. Im just too dumb to understand maybe
[3:50:34] captiv8: I’ll take the sound of a v8 over speed any day.
[3:50:34] manmower: teslas just have poor build quality
[3:50:34] xX_Vanq_Xx: electric is ONLY fast in acceleration. and they NO top speed
[3:50:39] Molvonos: @Towelliee So when you max out a renown, any rep rewards you get are Bind on Account.  Tokens from dirt/chests and rep rewards from quests
[3:50:42] shapebender: I feel like liquid is goona take rwf
[3:50:45] firehawk73: The issue with electric trucks is if you use them for what they are meant for, it kills your battery range
[3:50:47] Cower311: the ev is done before the combustion engine even takes off
[3:50:51] EggsotiX: MUSTANG OMEGALUL
[3:50:57] camp1ncarl_: EV is only good in the 1/4 mile
[3:50:59] captiv8: It’s pussy proof
[3:51:14] xX_Vanq_Xx: @cower311 that's no even close to true
[3:51:14] Samiccus: Acceleration is the only real thing that matters though who the hell is pushing their car to 100mph on an open road
[3:51:15] Cower311: @camp1ncarl_ what else is there?
[3:51:26] gelimarr: @Towelliee What car do you have?
[3:51:32] camp1ncarl_: The 1/2 mile and full mile?
[3:51:35] Diecast669: rofl
[3:51:39] ottavianni: NotLikeThis WutFace
[3:51:43] camp1ncarl_: Where the big boy cars race
[3:51:48] Nimz83: I watched a video of the Mach E vs a GT and it won, but not by enough for me to believe that it beat any model above the GT
[3:51:49] Redpandalol: @Towelliee before you drag race you play a demonic sounding f1 car revving on your sound system. juke em out
[3:51:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: you ever see that clip of the british car guys racing some new EV car against other super cars

[3:52:41] goldenharpbilly: Family
[3:52:48] Vox_Pop: At least that's leaning full in lol
[3:52:49] ThatHazardousGuy: The Mach E will win off the line, but even on a quarter mile the shelby GT500 will catch up to it.  I dont know about a normal GT though.
[3:52:52] PigPenLen: now that the technology is better than combustion engines its funny down here in the south seeing the gearheads lose their minds

[3:55:30] Vox_Pop: Was before DHs came out
[3:55:48] Hyelander_: warglaves drop for everyone. if you can equip it and do the BC week raid you unlock the transmog only for DH
[3:55:49] borthun: They are still swords, and you CAN wear them, BUT you must do the TBC timewalking after getting both to allow tmog on DH but thats it sadly. No other class can tmog them even after timewalking
[3:55:56] Cower311: as long as you get them and do the timewalking achieve to kill illidan after on any char you can xmog on the DH

[4:53:09] Andymint: popular opinion just means the opinion that is popular
[4:53:09] LX2_EXE: Loot is fine
[4:53:14] omgitsbby: Personal loot sucks ass
[4:53:20] CrunkyBrewster: Yeah basically
[4:53:20] gelimarr: loot is fine
[4:53:31] metavahn231: raiders stealing them transmogs
[4:53:33] Mattven: no per loot is better
[4:53:34] TialePetit: @Andymint ANd popular in the medium that the person follows.
[4:53:36] DeanoTV: LFR should be personal
[4:53:40] Artemisthemp: Simple solution 1. Remove LFR 2. Make Normal the new "LFR" 3. Easy clap
[4:53:52] gelimarr: dont remove lfr
[4:53:53] BafflingRainbow: personal loot in lfr is a valid and fine opinion... H or M prolly a no for me
[4:53:54] Clay2K_: Clay2K_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 88 months! 
[4:53:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: it probably should be personal in lfr because people could team up and need everything they can to trade to each other later
[4:54:01] Scarhearth: I love and hate group loot. Hate it because my guild has to pug sometimes so we lose loot to pugs. Love it because can trade without restriction
[4:54:03] citrinesoan: VoHiYo
[4:54:08] Deathbydaddy: lfr should be personal loot cuz mofos be needin on epic to de
[4:54:09] dracullus: it's almost same thing, people just don't know a thing about RNG
[4:54:09] TialePetit: @Artemisthemp So basically leave LFR in
[4:54:10] LX2_EXE: People think personal loot is better because they actually see purples dropping and don't receive it
[4:54:11] Molvonos: @elixirfield1 Its not stealing if they rolled on it and won.
[4:54:16] firewalltwitch: if they removed LFR then no1 would raid, so few ppl do already
[4:54:17] Molvonos: That just sounds like salty crying

[5:17:34] DrakeDuude: im really happy about the changes so far in blizzard
[5:17:35] thebakeriscomingforu: Metzen at best is helping with the next expac
[5:17:36] LX2_EXE: Metzen could have recommended the roadmap though

[5:18:20] Nokterian: 3 months at most \
[5:18:29] LX2_EXE: When would season 2 come out
[5:18:35] TialePetit: Looks like 2 patches, then season.. rinse and repeat
[5:18:39] manmower: then 1-2 raids in 2024
[5:18:44] manmower: so 4-5 raids for xpac
[5:18:45] snake_like: sounds like "deaths of chromie" type content if "mini raid" or "mega dungeon" aren't specified
[5:19:04] TialePetit: I heard 4 raids, but definitely things can adjust
[5:19:05] MisterD1rty: Make sv great again
[5:19:14] Incredible_Sausage: at this point, the next xpac could be Dragonflight part 2 and i'd be perfectly happy

[5:20:00] sokizia: Forbidden Reach The New Isle of Quel Danas?
[5:20:04] carmelchaos: void imo
[5:20:17] Mecabeast: what's opposite of shadowlands? lightlands? kekw
[5:20:18] Incredible_Sausage: @TialePetit agreed

[5:21:18] MaximumSerg: Blizzard really is putting out so man W lately
[5:21:21] Nokterian: Legion had the most consistent updates of patches
[5:21:22] ZeusDNA: November probably
[5:21:41] Norbi33: looks like they started to focus.. on this
[5:21:43] manmower: this looks faster than Legion
[5:22:04] ShaunsterTheMonster: That will be this time next year
[5:22:06] WildNordy: The problem with roadmaps is that: to meet deadlines for releases, things get rushed. Then mistakes happen. Then players get un-happy.
[5:22:16] CrimsonCrusader31: What if Chromie sends you back in time to major raids/dungeons :o
[5:22:31] Nokterian: True
[5:22:34] papaherc: hmm i wonder what the megadungeon will be?
[5:22:44] Krait06: and because they said F 9.3 SL
[5:22:50] Nokterian: The small content is good
[5:22:53] elfwyn20: feels like GW2
[5:22:57] citrinesoan: VoHiYo
[5:22:58] dimofodi: that's kind of how it should be imo
[5:23:02] MOLAR305: Think we will see a single boss raid like Ony back in the day
[5:23:15] manmower: as long as it has more story
[5:23:17] Incredible_Sausage: betting megadungeon is gonna be Silvermoon City with a revamp
[5:23:22] Kisswani: Primalist tomorrow seem like a chromie event , or at least bronze dragonflight stuff
[5:23:26] Nokterian: Its more consistent towards everyone who is playing

[5:24:11] c0mmander_starscream: Starfield hype
[5:24:15] thebakeriscomingforu: Seems like a good road map

[5:24:57] thebakeriscomingforu: Blizzcon road maps in the past didn't always turn out
[5:25:05] manmower: amen
[5:25:11] TialePetit: Blizz is setting expectations to stand by.. so any major delays will be painful .
