[1:28:10] Raikubest: should be like wotlk where frostbolt applies 20% ms
[1:28:11] bigclub666: :thinking:
[1:28:19] dooshken: remove MS and nerf healing
[1:28:31] archtme: Do u also wg on ret?
[1:28:33] ks_true: more damage from healers!!
[1:28:40] Alegral: remove healers in MDI they play without healers lets do 3 v 3 dps lobbies Kappa
[1:28:47] Raikubest: yea 20%, but all other MS in wotlk is 50%
[1:28:49] Raikubest: so its not insane insane
[1:29:01] Raikubest: think mindblast is also like 20%?
[1:29:32] Zartirian: remove classes, have all spells available in spellbook except u need to spend talent points to pick it
[1:29:46] Raikubest: on wotlk
[1:29:48] antoxdd: @Whaazz what do you think if they make a pvp talent for ret witch is MS pretty much with final verdict but this talent has an effect causing you not to be able to do any damage while bubbled
[1:29:53] buffevoker: Man i hate rotational ms
[1:29:57] sarent02: i think ranges should have 5-10% not 20-30%
[1:30:17] s4nti22: i dont think making ms on a dot is good

[1:30:39] Zartirian: the real fix is to give healers a MS, so we can have double hybrid teams
[1:30:40] sarent02: the better solution would be to nerf healers
[1:30:41] Raikubest: dh 2 set is a joke
