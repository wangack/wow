[3:39:03] spawn9292: monkaW
[3:39:04] theoutsider_93: yes, 40
[3:39:04] Slaymeh: theyre still the same
[3:39:12] 103kenzi: singZoomer
[3:39:13] kusanagilolcutting: long long way before sing can raid, lvl 60 -> pre-raid equipment hunts -> then they can start raiding
[3:39:13] Shyte: KEK
[3:39:15] onlyfansing: KEK
[3:39:15] DuKeIt0uT: I remember our MC clears took like 4 or 5 hours

[3:39:20] Zycte_: FeelsOldMan
[3:39:22] onlyfansing: BBoomer
[3:39:24] akkar: I played MC and had no idea what was happening
[3:39:27] Ganymed_: and then die to trash mobs
[3:39:28] LewterLoot: 40 zdps clowns KEK
[3:39:29] M0ff3l: and then when finally everyone is there its bed time for half of the group
[3:39:29] kusanagilolcutting: and it was a shit show with no concept of roles and strategy
[3:39:31] BriceBeNice: i dont even think he can go straight to molten core. he has to get BiS from dungeon first i think
[3:39:32] DrunkLoliOgre: and then 20 of them were afk hunters LUL
[3:39:39] IceColdKei: but whenever the schedules line up, it's legendary
[3:39:42] PlainWolfie: dukeitout bro the first few clears were long winded but when rag went down it felt good bro
[3:39:55] elimud: and then when everyone is finally there one of the hunters realizes they have no ammo

[3:40:08] StreamFollower: @Alleleirauh You don't pay attention to most of the other players. You only really need to pay attention to the tank, and the mob you're fighting, if DPS. If tank, pay attention to mob and healer. Healer, watch HP bars. Also watch fight mechanics in general, but yeah.
[3:40:08] DuKeIt0uT: @PlainWolfie, fuck ya I remember progging all of vanilla... old man days
[3:40:13] Alleleirauh: Is the current version the old deadly one?
[3:40:19] M0ff3l: im surprised you even got 40 people to get attuned for it
[3:40:24] kusanagilolcutting: yes it was nerfed, but also players gotten alot better
[3:40:28] supascoot: current molten core on classic is easy because people are way better at the game
[3:40:34] Alleleirauh: @StreamFollower Sounds pretty hectic
[3:40:38] DrunkLoliOgre: some of the "nerfs" were simply bug fixes
[3:40:42] PlainWolfie: i progged with a dad guild in 2019 release, felt nice when we got bosses down
[3:40:49] itsglorpoclock: are you farming morphlings PauseChamp
[3:40:52] akkar: there was no youtube LUL
[3:40:54] xyphlok: just play 4Head
[3:40:56] DuKeIt0uT: Bro I literally got full Tier 1 on my priest thinking it was BIS lmao
[3:40:56] elimud: u just hoped the dad running the raid knew what the mobs did KEK
[3:41:02] supascoot: they released unnerfed versions of old raids and they were cleared in an hour or two after release
[3:41:04] StreamFollower: NODDERS World firsts were a big deal. I'm sure they still are, but WoW population is lower and all.
[3:41:04] r3vol8: people die multiple times to get the correct method to do
[3:41:06] DuKeIt0uT: Yea guides were just word of mouth
[3:41:11] PlainWolfie: dukeitout bis mog EZ
[3:41:14] kusanagilolcutting: people went in without fire resistance, no potions, and clothiers bringing fire wands kekw
[3:41:15] silver0scale: so who get to poke the first big guy in the raid
[3:41:15] Hjolt: also people viewed it more secretevely. people intentionally missinformed others
[3:41:17] ifailedbad: thottbot
[3:41:19] hoho_au: i member thottbott
[3:41:21] akkar: thottbot lol

[3:41:46] Hnari: thottbot, without it no one could find Mankrik's wife KEKW
[3:41:54] DuKeIt0uT: Yea the best place to look for a guide was elitest jerks forums
[3:41:55] elimud: you can get a good idea of what we knew from looking at wowhead comments since they imported the old thottbot comments
[3:42:00] PlainWolfie: mankrik’s wife ono
[3:42:01] akkar: game was so much better back then Sadge
[3:42:02] Hjolt: people forget that is other people put info on thottbot and wowhead
[3:42:03] kusanagilolcutting: Joanna's 1-60 speed leveling guide was expensive, not you have questie and glime

[3:42:44] DiaBoLuS_THREE: @m0ff3l i also played guild wars 1 and broke the economy by buying all hydra claws. good times LUL
[3:42:52] S_H_O_D_A_N: worst thing is, when a new MMO comes out, it usually does so after a beta, so we never get even a couple weeks of that "complete unknown" feel
[3:42:53] kusanagilolcutting: old vanilla wow? what communication kekw
[3:42:59] DrunkLoliOgre: was it 20fps every raid too?
[3:43:03] Hjolt: true
[3:43:10] StreamFollower: It is. I imagine it will be a while before another MMO captures that feeling.
[3:43:11] nyr764: SAMEEEE
[3:43:13] akkar: 100%
[3:43:16] mawhulk: probably would happen again when they release the riot mmo
[3:43:16] crabpincer: Data mining is the death of mmio
[3:43:19] DuKeIt0uT: I think I maxed out at like 40 fps
[3:43:20] DiaBoLuS_THREE: same i still think back on my guild wars 1 self play shit. these times were awesome
[3:43:20] S_H_O_D_A_N: everything's guided all the way to end game before the first actual player even creates their toon
[3:43:24] nyr764: I MISS THOSE DAYS WHEN THERE IS NO GUIDE NO ANYTHING
[3:43:25] silver0scale: KEK
[3:43:25] czrz: did you play Outward?

[3:43:32] nyr764: FULL COMMUNICATE
[3:43:34] amarney: i remember being one of the first people to beat GW Nightfall and they couldn't figure out the double boss vs Shiro and the Lich...good times
[3:43:39] MatscherPlatscher: becasue of alpha/betas and fucking prepreprereleases
[3:43:40] ygg_druid: everything is true KEK
[3:43:46] StreamFollower: @nyr764 Meanwhile these days devs give you an achievement just for loading their game. Despairge
[3:43:46] M0ff3l: thats what I hate about release WoW, raid comes out, theres already guides for it, people already know whats their next BiS... like where has the exploration part gone
[3:43:46] kusanagilolcutting: I remember experiencing day night cycles, weather, open world exploration, taking the tram from SW, it was magical
[3:43:49] DuKeIt0uT: I have vanilla videos of myself pvping on my youtube from 2005
[3:43:51] BriceBeNice: ur manas
[3:43:52] DiaBoLuS_THREE: its like when i first watched a warcraft 3 pro match and was "holy shit they move their heroes immediatly wtf are they doing" :D
[3:43:54] Nightbot: Banned users will not be able to view stream anymore. Which means backseating = ban = no sing. Don't backseat
[3:43:54] nyr764: Man I really wanted to go back to those days
[3:43:58] DrunkLoliOgre: I fell in the ironforge grates because of fps drops and lag so many times in 2005-6 LUL
[3:44:15] MatscherPlatscher: BG 3 was awsome
[3:44:16] BobbyCarez: World first race is on-going right now
[3:44:21] DuKeIt0uT: fuck ya Wildhammer-US top alliance guild
[3:44:30] PlainWolfie: yeah retail world first is ongoing atm
[3:44:32] DiaBoLuS_THREE: ye but they also always have an eye on the other top guilds
[3:44:38] PlainWolfie: they’re at last boss now
[3:44:40] DuKeIt0uT: Still remember my battlegroup
[3:44:41] kusanagilolcutting: raids werent a thing until much later, 1-60 was the game and it was magical when you have friends to play with daily
[3:44:44] nyr764: @nyr764 Real and true man, everyone is guide through too, it is just not fun to people have meta knowledge even before reaching anything Sadge
[3:44:44] Llamer: yeah but they are progressing in PTR with no pressure and then do the Race to World First in normal game
[3:44:56] NothingInCH77: i think the strongest guild right now is fangsly
[3:45:19] kusanagilolcutting: i mean the obsession over raids
[3:45:21] Gon_Dola: simps smhmyhead
[3:45:26] elimud: i remember wiping to that dog over and over again just watching people get ripped in the fears KEK
[3:45:29] Runescrye: Yeah, most people didn't raid in classic
[3:45:40] BatagorDepok: wtf
[3:45:42] DuKeIt0uT: @elimud, getting feared into conflag
[3:45:45] DrunkLoliOgre: @StreamFollower don't think it will ever happen again, datamining and meta-obsession makes it impossible
[3:45:46] Zbunka: 25 is the sweet spot tbh
[3:46:00] DiaBoLuS_THREE: i prefer 10-20
[3:46:00] VylIian: those freaking quints from azshara in mc bocchiPossessed
[3:46:08] DuKeIt0uT: The only "vanilla experience" we will get is with Ashes of Creation or the Riot mmo

[3:46:26] Alleleirauh: Just parry the dodge roll WICKED
[3:46:26] yusba: and the disciplined style of play you have to do. its like a social exercise more than fun playing time :D
[3:46:29] Gon_Dola: doing raids and figuring them out with your buds is really awesome
[3:46:31] kusanagilolcutting: @DuKeIt0uT Riot mmo looks promising
[3:46:32] ifailedbad: internet is so different too
[3:46:32] DiaBoLuS_THREE: there will be an alpha and ppl will have 19203 guides on youtube before release
[3:46:33] Hjolt: there needs to be some very intrusive anti-datamining tech if future though, for sure. and no fuckin content creators for betas as to avoid guides.
[3:46:33] Runescrye: There won't be a vanilla experience again, the internet is different now
[3:46:33] elimud: min max from day 1 Sadge
[3:46:35] SirTweetums: BBoomer take me back
[3:46:38] DuKeIt0uT: Yea but how will anyone know what to do with a brand new mmo
[3:46:39] LewterLoot: Too easy to get information on everything
[3:46:41] LordSkyline: @DuKeIt0uT nah, with datamining and beta/alpha, all shiot is gona be known day0
[3:46:42] Gon_Dola: especially when you all agree to not look up guides or anything
[3:46:44] M0ff3l: when classic came out people already knew what their BIS items would be, how they were routing their levels
[3:46:45] Alleleirauh: Zoomer gaming Suffer
[3:46:46] thecoffeetoy11: Min maxing
[3:46:47] PlainWolfie: there are 2 other hardcore guilds that raid Naxx etc, frontier and HC elite. the Hunter died recently is the guy that raid lead the old Frontier to kill Kel Thuzad for world first hardcore
[3:46:52] r3vol8: people is impatient nowadays. old time MMORPG barely can survive nowadays

[3:48:55] heng12321: @DuKeIt0uT i think because there aren't really any skill animations(?) it literally just looks like autoattacking LOL
[3:48:57] Alleleirauh: @xyphlok Just play on 2 monitors
[3:48:57] 9d1w: @xyphlok 4Head just
[3:49:02] kusanagilolcutting: @Alleleirauh i had to starve and safe up lunch money to play kekw
[3:49:02] DiaBoLuS_THREE: @Alleleirauh SAME had to wait for guild wars, parents ouldnt allow 20 euro a month for gaming shit
[3:49:02] leamoeba24: 4Head
[3:49:06] DuKeIt0uT: @heng12321, ya you have to look for arcane shot and multi shot graphics
[3:49:16] DiaBoLuS_THREE: @Alleleirauh maybe they wouldve but i wouldn't dare to ask when father goes to work 16 hours a day
[3:49:23] Alleleirauh: @DiaBoLuS_THREE 20 euro was like a weeks worth of food back then KEK
[3:49:31] DuKeIt0uT: The devs have literally said that
[3:49:36] DuKeIt0uT: Game was not balanced for solo play
[3:49:40] VylIian: me and my dog meowing
[3:49:40] KazakiTV: It's a very good grinding spot
[3:49:55] kusanagilolcutting: it was an age of forced socializing, introverts be damned
[3:50:04] heng12321: @singsing for someone who's never played this game it really does look like you're just afk autoattacking
[3:50:09] Runescrye: I think game definitely is designed to be solo friendly - just a lot of things are designed to encourage grouping
[3:50:11] yusba: and it still was much more solo encouraged game than its competitor mmos back then, at least that was a big point about wow then
[3:50:12] walk1ngpanda: america
[3:50:12] MyCatDanDan: there were no introverts back then @kusanagilolcutting
[3:50:14] Hjolt: i kind of am unsure but that culture shift happened for some strange reasons involving real life money. I figure people want to "make it" in a game  and become like famous for a feat and feel pressured for competition. that is my guess anyway
[3:50:26] heng12321: LOL
[3:50:29] GuanYinMa: HAHAA

[3:50:42] ygg_druid: F5 forstbolt
[3:50:44] PlainWolfie: my first experience of WoW wasn’t terrible cause I found a good guild

[3:51:34] StreamFollower: A bad guild can only happen if you have a bad GM. If you have a bad GM, just duck the guild.
[3:51:34] Hjolt: I was socially anxious on top of bein introverted , untill i started teaching in a University. now i simply have no time to be anxious KEK
[3:51:35] GuanYinMa: sh!thead YEPP
[3:51:36] DuKeIt0uT: a lot harder to find a shitter in 40 man, in 25 man raids its a lot easier to find bad apples
[3:51:39] nyr764: Classic guild drama's
[3:51:39] kusanagilolcutting: if the guild leader isnt the problem that is
[3:51:41] zkchefski: @Alleleirauh same for me. It hard sometimes Aware
[3:51:42] BeyondThEnd: why did that mob become smol? HUHH
[3:51:43] DG_Jalord: What happened to that guy's height???
[3:51:50] FunFunJillChan: 🌽 Muted

[3:52:12] amarney: The only bad guild experience I had was the guy who was hosting the Vent server hated the drama in his previous guild that came from organized PVP, and really hated that we were doing it lol
[3:52:13] nyr764: "This guy never contributes to the guild and never goes into raids, we should kick him" Classic

[4:03:55] Alleleirauh: @Zycte_ But then you have pay2win, unless it just survives off skins?
[4:03:55] reactive_power: lost ark is the saddest one for me. some of the best arpg combat behind heavy grind and p2w
[4:03:57] silver0scale: maplestory is the prime example KEK
[4:04:01] grimjak_: I loved the gameplay of Blade & Soul its just extremely grind heavy
[4:04:06] Alleleirauh: Lost ark Sadge
[4:04:06] Deirdie: well , even with wow's success , they got shamed by king every year within activision

[4:04:39] rrecool: One korean MMO I know even have a democratic leader system KEK
[4:04:43] Nanquee: i am bold
[4:04:44] Shyte: lost ark was SO much grind, and then you could fail you your up[grades which made it worse
[4:04:45] Alleleirauh: @WaviestDragoon what monkaS that sounds so fucking stupid
[4:04:47] heng12321: BDO combat looks so cool but everything else kinda sucks
[4:04:47] Nanquee: so i am told

[4:04:48] photosynthesis: sing play FF11? MMO on Playstation2?

[4:05:41] sethwild: no money, no friends, just games
[4:05:42] taimou: didn't Wildstar try to appeal to the wow-classic crowd, but classic players are not the ones paying the bills, so the game died cause none of the modern mmo players wanted to do attunements etc.
[4:05:44] XaiRum_: RF Online 2 Inshallah

[4:06:12] Hjolt: KEK
[4:06:13] Runescrye: @taimou Wildstar understood classic wow wrong. They thought it was all "super hardcore raiding"
[4:06:13] nyr764: @julliant Kerning city I believe? I start at Ellina and just too derailed at start

[4:06:44] Shyte: @Shyte made it worse that you're limited to acquiring mats so failures feel even more Despairge

[4:07:25] Nanquee: pepeLaf
[4:07:26] chocostarphish: i think another issue people seem to be ignoring is mmo's are prohibitively expensive to maintain, so you need massive amounts of users to be successful - i.e. something like POE would have died if it were an MMO
[4:07:27] Alleleirauh: Is there a VoD of the guild meeting?
[4:07:31] faiz_saad: how did ultamar go?
[4:07:31] Skwishi: The convenience of free two day shipping, unlimited music and video streaming, AND sing sing chat freedom? Thanks, Amazon Prime! singsingTub - https://gaming.amazon.com/prime

[4:07:58] Runescrye: @chocostarphish I am would imagine they are not so hard to maintain anymore. Back in the day you needed specialized servers and people to maintain them. Nowadays a single person can probably do it.
[4:07:58] srinath007: Including a test at the end KEK @singsing
[4:07:58] galinhoo: are they selling dungeon nfts?
[4:07:59] 9uinsoo: 123

[4:08:14] ronthmplr: o7
[4:08:15] PlainWolfie: hunters have a role tho, there are some pulls that’s easier to do with a Hunter vs a warrior
[4:08:18] Wiwaldo: Well classic has almost no mechanic so that's the life
[4:08:20] DrunkLoliOgre: it's squeezing the cow dry for content at this point

[4:08:44] silver0scale: KEK
[4:08:45] kusanagilolcutting: nah sing your game sense is good enough, probably just watching the video on youtube would be good enough even for raiding
[4:08:46] DuKeIt0uT: grim guzzler
[4:08:47] PlainWolfie: they’re not squeezing the cow dry at all, those meetings are hilarious
[4:08:50] Nemykal: yeah they talked about that a lot

[4:09:27] kusanagilolcutting: those streamers are also following chat advise on how to grind efficiently not remembering that this is HC
[4:09:31] Skykyrie: lonedevil im more mad with turrets camping in 213 MADGEY
[4:09:34] Deirdie: the bar , where the tank would just panic and stop functioning .... over half the mobs inside are not elites

[4:18:48] Cheeseinyourpocket: @Alleleirauh SoD is completely different to Hardcore, so no
[4:18:53] PlainWolfie: it’s just that as a wow streamer you kinda have to stream SOD for content
[4:18:54] Runescrye: @Kaido1056A Yeah. you usually put shadowpriest in the melee group since they take a lot of incidental damage, but they are not a main source of healing
[4:18:57] Alleleirauh: @spawn9292 some people have an entourage of helpers PepeSpit

[8:59:24] solartech0: @StreamFollower There's only really 3 browsers right now -- chromium (controlled by google), firefox (controlled by mozilla), and safari (controlled by apple). Anything else uses the components from one of those three (generally the first two).
