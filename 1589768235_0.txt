[1:54:37] 91Niki: @Towelliee Yeah, I've encountered that a lot. Back when I was at Gattz. When we went to New Hampshire. We very often encountered +45min wait time for tables at restaurants. And it wasn't cuz they lacked seating, it's cuz they lacked waiters to support all their tables.
[1:54:43] justspunk: 4 hrs
[1:54:55] abracka_: maybe it'll come back up after 25 minutes towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium

[1:55:59] mavericks312: i mean but those same 5 games have them making more money then xbox this last gen
[1:56:04] Anhur55: Yo don't dis the new Mario. Odyssey was a masterpiece haha

[1:56:46] xmirrxrs: Same with every game announcement stream tbh
[1:56:49] Trawkey: Just give me the new breath of the wild already
[1:56:50] mavericks312: sont has a state of play tonight as well
[1:56:59] 91Niki: I've lost faith in Nintendo. They need some new people in charge over there who isn't 10 years behind, and too fed up in their pride and ego, and actually get on with the times. Their platform/games have so much potential, but is held back cuz they refuse to have them supported by better machines
[1:57:04] ZenLiving: @AllThingsMMORPG You take that back! It's going to happen now KEKW
[1:57:07] Trawkey: Zelda
[1:57:10] UltraKSlaya: aren't all game companies predictable now lol
[1:57:16] veroggo99: i just wan to play prime 4 sooo bad metroid fan boy :D
[1:57:22] UltraKSlaya: everything is sequels
[1:57:23] abracka_: @Trawkey watch them say nothing on botw2 and just announce a remaster of a game
[1:57:27] smokeyk1pperttv: how does a new WoW player get into the game? which expansion etc?
[1:57:37] mavericks312: @91Niki there is 0 reason why the switch should have been so far behind the ps4 and xbox graphically and mechanically tbh
[1:57:48] 91Niki: Like imagine if the Nintendo switch could reach the Steam Deck. Just imagine how amazing their games could be and look!
[1:57:52] Trawkey: @abracka_ Ye they already said the direct is about games releasing this winter...
[1:57:54] the_bad_goat: the_bad_goat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 59 months! Keep up the strong work
[1:58:14] abracka_: @Trawkey yeah we're getting nothing on botw2 then, sadge
[1:58:14] mavericks312: @Trawkey so splatoon4 and pokemon
[1:58:15] 91Niki: @mavericks312 It's the culture sadly
[1:58:16] Jarlan23: does nintendo have a thing like xbox game pass
[1:58:22] dutchie76: Babylon's Fall to close after less than a year live, Babylon's fallen and it can't get up.

[1:58:49] veroggo99: at least hoping for a metroid trailer of something
[1:58:51] Mecabeast: @towelliee couldn't you also use blasted lands portal in one of the major cities?
[1:58:54] mavericks312: @91Niki 100% and because nintendo fans buy up anything they put out why change
[1:59:00] GamingDad77: @smokeyk1pper In my opinion...Just play retail Shadowlands.
[1:59:06] mavericks312: 3 titles carry nintendo lol
[1:59:14] ArcaneSyntax: man just barely squeezed in the charger questline in classic before shutdown
[1:59:14] DeanoTV: mario zelda pokemon will never die
[1:59:16] 91Niki: They still make billions because of their games. Because people are HUGE fans of their games
[1:59:18] abracka_: have we heard anything at all about that mario movie they're making?
[1:59:20] smokeyk1pperttv: @smokeyk1pper ok thank you
[1:59:21] noosphear: Splatoon 3 was their most successful launch ever.
[1:59:23] NovicePro_: nintendo literally is older than video gaming
[1:59:27] IAmKayGee: Cleft of Shadows
[1:59:27] cabalish: nintendo is a card game company at first
[1:59:28] EpicMonkeyFailzGaming: but in all honesty Nintendo kind of started the whole gaming scene
[1:59:29] Featherbow: with the trolls
[1:59:29] TacDuc: It's the IP's that carry Nintendo, everything else is mostly meh
[1:59:33] Doublezoh: need to bee lvl 58 to enter the portal

[1:59:40] MoonwalkingAngel79: k
[1:59:45] mavericks312: doesnt nintendo also make money of pokemon cards themselves?
[1:59:47] Jarlan23: they'd get my attention if they announce a pokemon mmo
[1:59:47] BobLongMVP: Can’t use the blasted lands portal till lvl 58 @towelliee
[1:59:48] Featherbow: yes
[1:59:51] ArcaneSyntax: there's a portal there
[1:59:53] 91Niki: @mavericks312 Yeeep, they know they can milk us dry without changing anything
[1:59:59] hateful88: Valley of spirits
[1:59:59] Radiag: theres a port in tb and uc
[2:00:02] Mecabeast: portal is where mage trainers is in org
[2:00:05] hateful88: But on the left
[2:00:06] Trawkey: Breath of the wild 2 has been my most anticipated game since 2017
[2:00:07] MoonwalkingAngel79: i saw pinocio today i didnt knew he was a super hero
[2:00:08] kokochris: pretty sure minimum level tho
[2:00:11] BobLongMVP: It won’t let you click until lvl 58
[2:00:20] mavericks312: @91Niki point and case look at how pokemon games havent really changed since the first 3
[2:00:20] sageakl: yes58 for OL
[2:00:37] mavericks312: @Trawkey tbh metroid prime 4 has more hype for me then botw 2
[2:00:38] Jarlan23: bots
[2:00:39] ArcaneSyntax: there's also a portal back to org at the dark portal in outland @Towelliee
[2:00:42] sageakl: the dark one
[2:00:43] Febreze1212: bots
[2:00:46] abracka_: don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious
[2:00:58] Breakernaut: that's what we in the biz call multi boxing LUL
[2:01:06] maccaruso: Super sus, super-duper sus
[2:01:07] GamingDad77: smile and wave boys...smile and wave
[2:01:07] BlewGamingGroup: nothing to see here
[2:01:10] Mecabeast: crikey here we see wild bots in their natural habitat

[2:01:38] 91Niki: @mavericks312 I hate the way they are changing the looks of the pokemon games. Mechincs are amazing, the looks of the characters and stuff, bleh. And the switch just can't support anything decent. I am actually enjoying emulating the GBA and DS games a lot more these days!
[2:01:54] Hitokiri83: blizz wont care along as they arnt using 3rd party progams to control the other toons

[2:02:44] mavericks312: @DeanoTV but graphically its still lagging behin
[2:02:44] Deku_Scrub0: multiboxing is fine, its the use of software that duplicates your inputs thats not fine
[2:02:52] Breakernaut: The switch isn't designed to handle those games...It's suppose to be a casual console.
[2:02:59] Syssie: Syssie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[2:03:17] mavericks312: @Breakernaut i meant graphically,
[2:03:18] 91Niki: @DeanoTV Sure... cool. If only their online services supported it properly and wasn't so damn buggy. Not to mention, the switch is like a toaster. It runs like crap. I can emulate it onto the Steam deck and it will run better LUL minus the online services
[2:03:18] DeanoTV: @mavericks312 i dont care about graphics tbh, fun > graphics
[2:03:32] juga27: can you get to the lurker in ssc solo? i just want to fish him up for the achievement :P

[4:20:53] skymercii: it is
[4:20:54] Citrosis: are you enjoying dragonflight so far towlliee?
[4:20:58] AlphasaurusRexx: @Bennodkk just keep going. ive ran into stints like that but also have been on the other side. the nice thing is that m+ is spammable.
[4:21:04] Shrenko: I like that
[4:21:23] DasterdlyDaar: I think it is slick looking
[4:21:23] FlatulentFish: I really like the new UI, will be nice to see it all once its done
[4:21:27] NBK_Sethus: yeah that swiping animation seems familiar...
[4:21:42] Xaviwan078: the chest vault will stay on dragonflight for the loot^
[4:21:43] Rulem: it sems weird that the gear is sliding within the window.... if it was just the loot and no window, it would look better imo
[4:21:43] PokerFaceMoose: was the addon faster looter updated for that yet?
[4:21:46] Sh0cko: Can you change the size/scale of the actionbars on the ui ?

[4:23:00] Stiffy84: @sh0cko long on the ptr u can play with it on there
[4:23:07] matthewkshearer: its probably the charact limit tagging issue
[4:23:21] Mitune: are there any gimmicks like the one with the anima powers for the other storms?
[4:23:29] Skittlebeast: @Sh0cko yes you can

[4:26:00] thebakeriscomingforu: That will probably be the first "buff" to evokers is to give them normal ranges
[4:26:05] Molvonos: I mean, in M+ most casters were in pretty close except for extreme circumstances, just to deal with mechanics.  at least in the groups I was in.

[4:26:55] MILESkg21: then its just another HPally with Dragon form Kappa
[4:26:57] Rulem: I wonder how evoker would work on fights like Sludgefist
[4:27:05] theDirtyon3: its like 39% of the raid right now in some spread out situations
[4:27:05] Rudric_Ice: do u think its better to have a OP class on launch than an undertuned one ?
[4:27:19] Mecabeast: oh towelliee how bout them letting you level northrend crafting at 350 instead of 375
[4:27:32] Skittlebeast: nah, evoker is jjust a melee healer - similar to hpal
[4:27:32] Moobot:  Please visit towelliee.com to get caught up on all of the latest Youtube videos, Discord links, sponsor information and news/events that may be coming up in the stream!
[4:27:33] Wheeellz: 25 yd range just doesnt work unless they design fights around it
[4:27:36] Molvonos: Well, Hover lets you cast and move at the same time; I think hover's off the GCD
[4:27:59] Skittlebeast: evoker won't be played in pvp
[4:28:00] Rulem: @Skittlebeast unless they consider them ranged for mechanics
[4:28:25] Skittlebeast: blizzard doesn't make those kind of decisions, raiders do
[4:28:31] DasterdlyDaar: Is the casting bar under their health plates a mod?
[4:28:32] wEiRdO_dUdE: Death grip has a 30 yard range, that's EZ
[4:28:41] Rulem: both evoker specs would be a mess on Sludgefist
[4:28:46] Retributions93: Retribution paladin still looking crap?
[4:29:11] kokochris: "who the fuck is that.... Lets kill em"
[4:29:14] Rudric_Ice: i think its better to have an OP class at launch than an undertuned one imo

[4:32:19] PvtHudson093: do you think its ready to release in 2ish months?
[4:32:20] Rulem: if they are considered ranged, no.
[4:32:26] GamingDad77: @Towelliee on that towCopium hard today
[4:32:34] MrGrimms: Morning Towelliee
[4:32:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Having a shorter range for dps isn't as bad....melee has been running around like maniacs forever
[4:32:42] Valyxx: @Towelliee Which tanks feels the best to play currently in the beta?
[4:32:52] thebakeriscomingforu: evokers probably would be fine on range in dungeons but the concerns are in raids.

[4:36:00] luchion09: does it look diff in purple upgrade @Towelliee
[4:36:00] MILESkg21: wtf LuL
[4:36:05] GrannySlayerOfHell: ever had a character show as locked on beta?
[4:36:11] Jeanssi: ask the vendor the options
[4:36:18] Jeanssi: sigil guy
[4:36:26] Jeanssi: you'll see it's 4/week
[4:36:26] Lenietwitch: well that's prety much running dungeons for an item, like that's 14 attemps of a regular dungeon, not that much
[4:36:27] LeDerpski: What the ilvl compared to dungeons/raids?
[4:36:39] MrKray2: Will M+ drop those sigil things?
[4:36:46] Aidler: I hope you can do it solo
[4:36:49] Holysal: ppl going to hate boomies even more KEKW
[4:36:51] Stiffy84: do the lo9k different upgraded?
[4:36:59] LeDerpski: @Holysal why

[4:37:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: They are trying to get the sigils to make it last 6 months before people can complete the set
[4:37:56] LeDerpski: @Holysal They changed starfall its a targeted AoE now. It doesnt follow the boomy anymore
[4:37:57] NVbrutal: feel like that would make it pointless, cause the whole point its to get the gear before raid release.
[4:38:08] Mitune: This item grind seems like its for casuals more than raiders. Especially if its gated like that

[4:38:57] LeDerpski: @Holysal Dont see how but sure :)
[4:38:58] RiskyBusines_ez: world-griding gear/rep based gear has been useless in wow for so many expansions now
[4:39:26] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can upgrade your hammer in like a month

[4:40:05] GamingDad77: or just M+
[4:40:12] icerasta: I could see 1 per element per day
[4:40:13] bawheid: DF is looking like the first wow expansion i won't play. nothing about it grabs my interest.
[4:40:18] PvtHudson093: @Towelliee Anything good in the vault?
[4:40:20] BoezIRL: it's for those that don't do raid and m+ so they can have something to do and good gear for next patch
[4:40:28] Aidler: That's why it's for casuals that don't do M+ or raid like me
[4:40:37] MILESkg21: its for extreme casuals

[4:40:45] hadihajri1: @Towelliee how about professions gearing?
[4:40:50] Mitune: My point exactly @Aidler
[4:40:53] brettbeb2421: Yo @towelliee, who all is going to be a part of your DF marathon? You, lula, dcarter, and maybe terryble?
[4:41:08] wEiRdO_dUdE: By the time you actually get enough sigils, the stuff is worthless apart from transmog
[4:41:12] Aidler: @mitune 👍
[4:41:18] skymercii: @Towelliee my dk got double sockets and my hunter got the haste / mastery sire ring at 285

[4:41:59] Xailen: I still dont get limiting anyones grind outside of greedy practices to keep people subbed.
[4:42:03] Jeanssi: you get those from the quest east in valdrakken
[4:42:06] bawheid: @commander_eggi maybe i'm missing something. what do find appealing about DF?
[4:42:20] MrGrimms: oh geez
[4:42:20] falldrgn: and clearly the birthday girl Ony.. shes clearly the star of the show
[4:42:22] MILESkg21: great idea 4Head

[4:42:50] falldrgn: @bloodyreapr nope.. he works for TikTok now
[4:42:50] Holysal: he does stream over night too
[4:42:53] Aidler: Lore is welcome
[4:42:55] skymercii: oooooh
[4:42:57] NBK_Sethus: tik tok omg
[4:42:57] ElGompers: @Xailen I paly the first month or 2 and the last month or 2 of each expac for that reason
[4:43:07] UltraKSlaya: tik tok gaming
[4:43:17] skymercii: i always like watching lores stream.
[4:43:20] EKS90_: @bawheid One big aspect is the chance to play my alts again without having to farm stuff like AP (3 different versions) conduits, legendaries, soulbinds etc, i can just gear it normally, play with professions again, and actually not feel like im missing out on my main, since some stuff is also account wide.
[4:43:34] Aidler: He would get a little t of TikTok questions naguuraGiggle
[4:43:36] MILESkg21: sounds good makes sense 4Head

[4:45:24] MrGrimms: There has to be a gate somewhere for gear.
[4:45:28] HeatherJC83: WOW  I finally caught you live!
[4:45:29] gritbarontv: that involves grouping, lol
[4:45:31] Holysal: bc he wants too @Ajaexx
[4:45:33] EKS90_: @Ajaexx money and exposure.
[4:45:34] Croxssis: mythic plus dungeons will be the way to gear for casuals and people not interested in raiding it sounds

[4:45:47] MILESkg21: there are some people who dont do dungeons or raids at all and just craft all day
[4:45:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: If I can craft a full set of purples, then I don't care about those sigils
[4:45:56] TheCliffyShow: Do you think there will be a new beta build today?
[4:45:57] gritbarontv: well it's something as a goal
[4:46:07] rbgdev: No I mean there was like some drama or something about it people were talking about
[4:46:10] Mitune: ITs also great Mog
[4:46:11] SethBrowning: Maybe it's just limited the first few weeks? Because capping the equivalent of LFR gear is weird to me
[4:46:16] NVbrutal: they are gating gear that will be irrelevant in a few weeks after launch lol.
[4:46:19] bawheid: @commander_eggi i never really played more than 2 or 3 classes so it was pretty easy to keep them geared, so the alt thing has never been my thing. the new talent trees look pretty interesting but not enough to draw me to play
[4:46:24] adampanerabread: I can't even imagine trying to farm those sets with other people around with mob tagging
[4:46:24] GamingDad77: @wEiRdO_dUdE but you can only wear so many crafted pieces

[4:46:34] blahzi: how is mages in DF?
[4:46:40] manhooties: why don't they just add a 2-day cooldown to it of some sort? so then at least it gives you some time to do it You don't have to do it all everyday
[4:46:46] EKS90_: @Ajaexx Basically people claiming he faked mental issues and wanting to take a break from streaming, pausing his twitter and everything, just to come out with a stream everwhere announcement.
[4:46:50] im_n0t_jezus: LOL
[4:46:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: Feral pumper!
[4:46:56] gritbarontv: a froyo

[4:48:20] Llamatude: blizzard just forgot to neuter their cats.. what they see how good they are this will not stand!
[4:48:21] EKS90_: @bawheid well outside of that I like the new flying cause gw2 has some of the best mount mechanics, profession rework is something i have been wanting, talents,  new world content, and the big one for me is as i said the not 5 different sub systems u gotta keeep track off, i play more than wow and gearing3-4 chars was not something i wanted to do , but in DF i want too.
[4:48:25] Mitune: Things are broken and positions are talents are still weird.
[4:48:32] arzak: @hatchetharry_  thx
[4:48:47] andrewbergeron: anyone having issues with blizzard purchases?
[4:48:54] jeflag: they get a blue post? hey why didnt i get a blue post....
[4:48:55] EKS90_: @bawheid and also the theme.. the aspects and dragons are my faovurite theme in wow, i have wanted dragon isles since vanilla scrapped content, so for me this is THE expansion. so im happy with no systems.
[4:49:11] Jomuse92: That was a phat spirit link indeed
[4:49:12] freetherocktv: @Towelliee KNUT is about to play wow for the first time doing wotlk classic its going to be hilarious watching him play for the first time

[4:49:47] skymercii: Soul reaper
[4:49:50] LeDerpski: @Zilberg beta is already out
[4:49:50] TheCliffyShow: I'm not begging for an assassination rogue bluepost. In fact, I don't want to see one, because it might mean they fucked something up.
[4:49:59] Mitune: As of right now the WW rotation is just spam Black out kick to refresh Rising sun kick. Something needs checking there
[4:50:01] Zilberg: Oh well shit lmao
[4:50:02] EKS90_: @bloodyreapr Nope I rerolled warrior first ttime after a 16 year old paladin main xD
[4:50:31] Tamz_tv: a 16 year old paladin main made you reroll warrior?

[4:50:50] gritbarontv: so to change spec in DF you have to go the trainer?
[4:50:53] Shrenko: WutFace
[4:50:56] jeflag: he jizzed all over the place
[4:50:57] EKS90_: @Tamz_tv no, I have been maning a paladin since vanilla wow, in SL, I decided to reroll to my warrior fulltime.
[4:50:59] gritbarontv: or a town thing

[4:51:35] Mitune: Damage has nothing to do with it
[4:51:42] Redpandalol: @towelliee I think it’s because people want to be sure shit is being worked on. After years of void shouting it feels like we are being listened to so we want to keep the communication.

[4:52:30] infinityarty: atm though, they dont seem to be really doing targeted testing anymore are they?
[4:52:55] MrGrimms: this has prob been the most dev/class communication they have done with the community in the last 2 expacs maybe 3... And the fact they are listening to the community and making said changes too
[4:52:59] TheCliffyShow: That's why you shouldn't beg for a blue post. Because it might be bad.
[4:52:59] Rudric_Ice: @mitchumtx there was a pretty big post about dks

[4:53:29] AlphasaurusRexx: @mitchumtx yeah dks look solid af
[4:53:33] Mitune: Except for those legos in Legion LUL . No clue why they died on that hill
[4:53:35] MrGrimms: but its huge that they are listening to our changes and making them too
[4:53:37] mitchumtx: @Rudric_Ice
[4:53:37] DasterdlyDaar: @Towelliee I love playing as tank class. Being as that I am just returning to wow from a few years off, which tank class is the best one in endgame content at the moment?
[4:53:46] Inthezonewow: DK OMEGALUL
[4:53:47] infinityarty: ion looked exhausted af tho on the df announcement
[4:54:12] EKS90_: @GamingDad77 I just couldnt do paladin anymore, it feels bad, its just bad (to me) So I decided to change main for the first time ever, and im having fun even tho im mad mthat im missing all the old reps and stuff i have done over the years ^^
[4:54:14] comicbookrican: This looks pretty cool
[4:54:20] Inthezonewow: Re-steal Metamorphosis from DH and give it to Lock
[4:54:24] MrGrimms: Ellesmere made a huge tree change to holy paladin and WHY it should flow this way and they said ok and went back and revised it
[4:54:49] Rudric_Ice: Frost DK is getting their obli build buffed so im happy fuck breath
[4:54:53] Rulem: warrior grip was nerfed too much imo
[4:54:54] rvtzzzz: bm is ballanced , pretty good
[4:54:57] goblinknows: on mythic LUL
[4:54:58] Molvonos: @Inthezonewow Why would you give something that wasnt ever theirs back?  S'like throwing a perfectly good steak into the garbage.  towSip
[4:54:59] GamingDad77: @GamingDad77 understandable. I miss playing ret but do have lots of fun trying other claqsses as well
[4:55:01] Shrenko: report
[4:55:04] Aidler: The success of faited raids should have shown Blizz that players like to get power. No player power outside of M+, PvP or raiding in DF is just odd
[4:55:06] AlphasaurusRexx: @GamingDad77 man im trying to move on from my shaman. the only class ive played since tbc and i keep getting fomo from all the stuff i unlocked on him. sunk cost fallacy hits hard lol
[4:55:31] skymercii: doing upper kara this week is gonna be straight ass simplFINE
[4:55:53] mayonaes: someone say otter?
[4:55:53] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[4:55:54] Inthezonewow: @Inthezonewow Cause lock meta looks better than DH towNut3
[4:55:54] GingerPurple: System Madge
[4:55:57] AceZero12: I don't think warriors will use the grip very much. I wish they gave us different utility that would mostly be useful in dungeons where we lack utility. Raiding and pvp we are in a great spot.
[4:55:58] 91Niki: Otter? ijpPOGGERS
[4:56:03] Shrenko: people want less RNG
[4:56:03] 91Niki: I like otters
[4:56:04] infinityarty: but... there is basically no borrowed power in season 4?
[4:56:04] EKS90_: @GamingDad77 Exactly how i felt moving on from paladin, I just decided to take the leap and just get over it, it hurt for a while and i tried going back once, but now im fully commited to warrior instead for DF as a restart.
[4:56:06] Aidler: So it seems
[4:56:34] DecayedmiNt: "You think you do, but you dont" experiment
[4:56:38] Jeanssi: it's good that at start there isn't so much to do, time to level alts
[4:56:39] jeflag: "it's just a prank bro"
[4:56:40] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard be like, "This is what you wanted. If you hate it. It's your own damn fault."
[4:56:48] GamingDad77: @91Niki they are cute!
[4:57:08] Aidler: But players also wanted no changes in Classic and then...
[4:57:14] skymercii: the fated raid system is good for 1 reason imo: bad luck protection
[4:57:15] 91Niki: @GamingDad77 The cutest ijpCUTE
[4:57:17] Frostaloth: Hey!  Where can i download details for Beta ? And i stuck for Lava Burst quest in Azure span and can't level by questing. How did you reach level 70?

[5:27:00] toobaked1987: I wouldnt know. I am a poor, cant afford American insurance.
[5:27:01] PokerFaceMoose: they clean with the check up
[5:27:02] Deku_Scrub0: realms up
[5:27:03] TompsonX: I almost gagged when I had to take my scale lol

[5:27:34] ClassicMalcontent: In Pagle US.
[5:27:40] Bagel09: For me they always do xray n cleaning

[5:28:15] AgentPrometheus: they do both usually
[5:28:16] Sollice: They schedule a deep clean later
[5:28:22] rodimusprime085: Its only painful if your mouth is jacked or the tech suxors
[5:28:24] Sollice: if you need a deep clean
[5:28:24] Bagel09: For me, yeah, I get both done. I love getting my teeth cleaned though.
[5:28:28] NicktheGatorfin: This stream's reminded me that I need to call back my Dentist to set up a cleaning lol
[5:28:28] KyleEverett: Weird they would add a new PvP realm 13 days before wrath launches. Not a ton of time to hit 70
[5:28:29] Arabus135: ive never gotten a checkup without a clearning
[5:28:30] Brotah: I did cleaning, x-ray, and 2 wisdom teeth in one go
[5:28:31] Bagel09: every 6 months

[5:28:40] itsyoboywill: deep clean is good, not painful at all

[5:52:19] GamingDad77: there is only one faction anyway.
[5:52:20] Karn1987: just made ramen with pork loin and tomato and green beans
[5:52:33] Epiclawlzable: @Towelliee of course you would say that... HORDE SCUM
[5:52:34] Rudric_Ice: faction pride was dead when metzen left
[5:52:39] imabirdhaww: you can thank the wow storytellers for that crap
[5:52:55] Zigg3man: hey @Towelliee . I saw your Vengence DH YT, but never saw you played dungeon later on with Vengence DH. so, how are they as tank in DF?
[5:52:56] 91Niki: @91Niki We don't have any Starbucks or similar within 50 miles of my house. So I don't come across those shop often
[5:53:00] ItsDerpDiggler: Nope... LOL I still ONLY play horde and have since 2007
[5:53:01] ShadowDMG6969: Faction Pride is weird because now it's devolved into which Faction has the better Community
[5:53:03] BambooStylez: F
[5:53:06] angrynick1105: lmfao i hate whgen that happens
[5:53:26] ItsDerpDiggler: But only because I can't get into the different races on Alliance
[5:53:27] s7wede: Faction pride mattered when there was no such thing as a server transfer or faction transfer. When they introduced those services, they should have done away with it altogether and merged the playerbase
[5:53:44] TotallyNotRaien: why is there faction pride for the horde... story wise they are all just greedy selfish genocidal maniacs
[5:53:58] GamingDad77: @91Niki we live just out of the main city. So none close. But in town they are everywhere
[5:54:03] Karn1987: @Towelliee i got 78 alts i play both sides evan pvp im honor lvl 300
[5:54:15] imabirdhaww: no more faction boundaries, it's just ruining the game at this point
[5:54:19] draxss: @TotallyNotRaien same can be said about ally races to
[5:54:23] ShadowDMG6969: I mean they could Implement the hard liners VS the people wanting Peace. Hence our Hated Worgen leader
[5:54:28] volkiers: since sigue of ogrimar X
[5:54:31] Rohen86: Just bring back Class Halls and have the players dedicate to those causes and not so much Horde/Alliance
[5:54:45] TotallyNotRaien: what have ally races done?
[5:54:47] imabirdhaww: yeah class would work way better than horde/alli
[5:54:54] TotallyNotRaien: like i really dont know
[5:54:57] JediNeo99999: You can't really have faction divide in a game with players on both sides. No one can ever really lose. And we keep teaming up anyways for a big bad threat
[5:55:00] Rudric_Ice: Night elves should be their own faction and undead too :)
[5:55:12] imabirdhaww: could have class factions, like druids and shamans more aligned than rogues/warriors
[5:55:45] TotallyNotRaien: faction devide in an mmo which relies on player numbers is absolutely asinine
[5:55:47] angrynick1105: angrynick1105 subscribed with Prime.

[5:56:19] GamingDad77: @JediNeo99999 exactly.
[5:56:28] stallowned: they can yes

[5:56:33] 91Niki: If you ask for it? Maybe
[5:56:34] TotallyNotRaien: usually i think its just local anesthesia
[5:56:36] PokerFaceMoose: if you get teeth removed
[5:56:38] Arabus135: for surgery but not for routine checkus

[5:57:03] DasterdlyDaar: Remember have a cassette tape and those skinny headphones when at the dentist for getting work done?
[5:57:10] crittinkitten: Depends on the severity. Most things are done awake.
[5:57:12] amricatt: Nope.  All implant stuff they give local things like root canels.
[5:57:14] nihilistic_bat: most times its easier to just numb your gums
[5:57:16] TotallyNotRaien: they just heat you over the head with a mallet and take out the meat hooks
[5:57:19] sqknarf: probably just numb you up, my dad just had a piece of his tongue cut off and they didnt do anything but numb him.
[5:57:19] Brotah: they call a Priest in and give you Pain Suppresion
[5:57:23] imabirdhaww: they put you out nowadays.  i woke up in the middle of an operation and the dentist had his hand in my wallet
[5:57:38] smashwow: dad had all his teeth pulled. the drugs weren't strong enough to keep him under. @Towelliee  so if you're a bigger dude careful
[5:57:40] Rohen86: Gambling debts
[5:57:45] nihilistic_bat: thats not a dentist, thats a butcher LUL
[5:57:48] sqknarf: make sure it was cancerous

[5:58:28] nihilistic_bat: my brain took imagined the piece that was cut off way different then it was im sure
[5:58:32] imabirdhaww: biopsy?
[5:58:33] 91Niki: Mate, when I had my one wisdom tooth removed, they had to surgically remove it. Eventually the doctor said "I can't give you any more local anesthetic, it won't do anything. I had 3 people hold me down. Felt like they were drilling into my jaw. Good times
[5:58:41] Shrenko: WutFace
[5:58:45] Arabus135: just so everyone knows these days certain cancers are so beatable
[5:58:50] MaximumSerg: a skin tag?
[5:59:20] theSalute: @91Niki ahhh yes I still remember the feeling of the dentist cutting up my wisdom teeth with some cutter then ripping it out in pieces :D

[6:03:03] r0b928: I watched my ex get the lasik surgery, I couldn’t watch I almost passed out
[6:03:07] Aidler: you get the iron mask

[6:04:07] Bagel09: lasik surgery was very rewarding, very worth it. It was scary when your eyes are open and just for a moment you lose your eye sight- that was messed up.
[6:04:10] Kulture1: i hate wearing glasses
[6:04:10] Aidler: at some point I would be „I tell you everything….“

[6:04:56] Broomba: Hes leveling to have fun - its a concept in games
[6:05:09] Kneckt: jesus
[6:05:27] 91Niki: I mean I guess with really expensive stuff it makes sense
[6:05:31] angrynick1105: yea i eventually want to go to Turkey for a hair transplant. omg 1000 id do that for perfect teeth today
[6:05:31] MaximumSerg: @angrynick1105 still would cost less than getting it done here
[6:05:44] MedicineMan: is travel to Cuba allowed? I'd love to visit it
[6:05:49] 91Niki: @angrynick1105 Sure, for expensive stuff. But not regular visits LUL
[6:05:51] Artivicii: Soooo u saying we should fly to Cuba for dentistry
[6:06:07] angrynick1105: plane ticket isnt much

[6:06:51] Kneckt: U can queue for BGs from the interface now in classic :O
[6:06:55] angrynick1105: makes me want to play wow again lol
[6:07:10] leaprah: im on atm

[6:08:35] angrynick1105: whats a good server in classic? bc i quit playing and i cant play my old character its stuck on a non playable server i think
[6:08:47] username_hany: beta servers are down?
[6:09:20] Mozzeyy_: are you gonna farm for brutal gear? @Towelliee
[6:09:38] goosejamss: @angrynick1105 Maladath never has a queue
[6:09:50] Prisana: brutal is absolutely not fast
[6:09:57] EKS90_: you spam AV
[6:09:58] LeDerpski: As fast as you can get honor
[6:09:59] Kneckt: @Towelliee u can queue for BGS by pressing the H key now
[6:10:00] MaleFrom73: there is a pvp WQ up in beta today
[6:10:01] EKS90_: tedious
[6:10:01] nihilistic_bat: @Kneckt oh wow, that is actually nice
[6:10:01] 1nc1nerated: Just spam AV
[6:10:17] 1nc1nerated: took 2 days ish to get full brutal
[6:10:18] ProteinHydra: Just 20 hours of AV lol
[6:10:19] onesadkeanu: 24 hours = 62K honor lol
[6:10:34] onesadkeanu: 5p and wep
[6:10:37] angrynick1105: @fractaleyes thanks
[6:10:42] ProteinHydra: And brutal gear = between BT and Sunwell Power level
[6:11:09] N3llee: yep why everyone is grinding bgs these last few weeks
[6:11:17] zenkodac: jst av for brutal, thats all the gear you'll need to level, specially if you get some loot from the event bosses

[6:12:33] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:12:41] orbiitz269: i'm kinda ready to level in wrath without BiS to see how different it was from OG wrath
[6:12:42] BigBusiness: You can queue for bgs anywhere now too
[6:12:44] Karn1987: @Towelliee  i still wear my black shadowlands event shirt cant wait for a dragon flight one
[6:12:55] zenkodac: also having that quest log ready at caped quest to turn in can get you half way into 71 before even going to northrend
[6:13:02] Kneckt: press H
[6:13:03] zenkodac: to skip that start rush
[6:13:11] Kale_Nd: @BigBusiness you can't, wotlk classic is just from bg npc
[6:13:25] Kneckt: @Towelliee press H and then hit battlegrounds tab
[6:13:36] Kale_Nd: No queue for bgs from honor page in wotlk classic
[6:13:37] BigBusiness: @Kale_Nd Hit h and try queueing, it works now
[6:13:50] Aro725: YEP stupid
[6:13:54] y0rtek: yup, and BGs are cross server lmao
[6:13:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: Yup
[6:14:17] Macnerd1239: the whole no dungeon finder this is stupid. The solve to the problem is just limiting it to that server.
[6:14:43] Kneckt: good point
[6:15:35] Macnerd1239: it's already ridiculous. People will be LF1M of a specific class and spec for a 5 man like it's some sort of +30 mythic key
[6:16:27] Artivicii: Garbo
[6:16:31] GamingDad77: "social interactions"
[6:16:51] Damuffin14: we wanted to test this idea. turns out it was terrible
[6:16:55] Artivicii: Garbaj
[6:16:57] Macnerd1239: the social interaction they're referring to: "inv"
[6:17:09] Artivicii: @macnerd1239 LOL
[6:17:15] The_Metal_Man: @Macnerd1239 Can yo blame them tho when spellcleave class do so much more damage than anybody else that waiting for those specs is a net time gain?
[6:17:15] ItsDerpDiggler: @Towelliee I think they're just waiting a while after Wrath launch so that people have to go through the regular questing routes for a while first
[6:17:16] SilkeySmooth: wrath will be a dead raid log game by the first raid
[6:17:45] sliproach: NPCs spat on my in classic i can't even spit on people!
[6:17:55] ItsDerpDiggler: Yeah, I wish it was there cuz I love dungeoning all day myself lol
[6:18:20] Ketchup_Popsicle: i dont know why lfd is such a big deal
[6:18:24] SilkeySmooth: are you taking abotu a quieue for m+
[6:18:57] jkitchin75: @SilkeySmooth no no lfg in wotlk

[6:20:52] TheseDaysLIVE: server?
[6:20:55] The_Metal_Man: its a numbers game tho, you have no real reference for skill level of your pug keys, so why would you not take the specs that, without any skill level reference, give you the best chance of success? Esp this seasonw ith locks
[6:21:42] Karn1987: you know i cant play wow if my curser is on the chat buttion

[6:24:07] SilkeySmooth: dragonflight pre patch will be the downfall of classic wrath
[6:24:31] 0Locke: I completely agree Towel
[6:24:35] Rev_4_Life: I just want to do dungeons idc about finding 4 people around the same level on my server.
[6:24:36] GamingDad77: @goblinknows there is a portal to the blasted lands in the major cities. Just take the portal and walk to the BC portal
[6:24:40] crittinkitten: Hope dps in wrath are ready to get rejected for 30 min trying to get a dungeon.
[6:24:46] Aidler: people contribute to the downfall if there is any and not lfr or lfd
[6:25:08] GamingDad77: @Aidler the players are the only downfall.
[6:25:21] Karn1987: @Towelliee my fav classic quest was the one from the burning steps were the dwarf told you to go steal him some snuff from dark irons
[6:25:21] Aidler: yeah
[6:25:29] theos666: It was corona times
[6:25:38] theos666: Don't forget that
[6:25:41] Jaxerath: wow isn't social anymore, you get in a dungeon, don't say anything unless someone screws up and they get kicked.
[6:25:48] soysos91: How much leeway do we give Blizzard because of COVID? I feel like that def delayed a lot of things
[6:26:03] ScalarGaming: blizz only company that lost money during covid
[6:26:07] Rudric_Ice: corona lol ? look at other companies
[6:26:08] swervo61: with S1 and S2 of M+ seasons being kinda meg
[6:26:11] swervo61: meh*
[6:26:13] GamingDad77: Covid is the sorriest excuse of excuses I have ever seen
[6:26:26] NILLme: @Towelliee can you press H and check the PVP panel? I heard you can queue for a BG from there now
[6:26:27] SubliminalsTTV: i mean the pandemic wasnt hindering other studios sooooo lol
[6:26:53] kokochris: lol
[6:27:04] Aidler: I‘d argue that WoW was never especially social. there were just groups of friends… often they knew each other from RL before WoW
[6:27:04] Moobot: Details for DF Beta https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/details/files/3974119

[6:27:17] cyb0rg_007: sapped
[6:27:22] crittinkitten: @Soysos19 They did
[6:27:26] goosejamss: @Soysos19 he's being sarcastic
[6:27:44] GamingDad77: @Aidler I think Wrath was the last xpac where it was social.
[6:27:56] Jaxerath: even ffxiv was delayed and had the worst expansion launch i've seen
[6:28:04] SubliminalsTTV: @Towelliee obviously they werent the only ones lmfao I was referring to the comment thread of people saying we needed to give all the leeway to blizz because of covid
[6:28:16] vic_ave: ffxiv issue was to chip shortage so thats not a fair arguement
[6:28:20] SubliminalsTTV: there were plenty of studios that thrived and did well during covid
[6:28:33] crittinkitten: @RzN_Shinobi Did you read that comment thread 3 years ago?
[6:28:39] Jaxerath: @VicAva12 you can't cherry pick
[6:28:43] cyb0rg_007: what happened after wrath at that point. it almost seemed game breaking
[6:28:53] vic_ave: facts not cherry picking
[6:28:55] ArcaneSyntax: my hand of recoking at 68 does like 500 damage, it's crazy
[6:29:00] SubliminalsTTV: @RzN_Shinobi ??? holee fuck are you daft?
[6:29:07] PokerFaceMoose: warlock dots count as tagging before they do dmg i think
[6:29:18] Jaxerath: and the 5 month delay of launch? was chip shortage?
[6:30:15] SpoofAvatar: cause china shut down manufacturing due to covid
[6:30:21] PokerFaceMoose: tanker stuck in suez canal, covid, inflation
[6:30:21] TheSpace_Sloth: covid there was a shortage on everything because of it
[6:30:22] Aidler: just in the news: Amazon plans to raise wages…. well that’s a sensation naguuraGiggle
[6:30:22] kokochris: the chip shortage was a global supply chain issue, it affected many industries.
[6:30:27] ArcaneSyntax: taunt has the bigger range
[6:30:28] Nokterian: Covid and there is still covid still chip shortage for a lot of factory's
[6:30:37] Liquid_Hamm: insta
[6:30:43] Nokterian: now they shut down all factory's because of the extreme heat

[6:36:54] barefoot_on_bricks: lol @Mitune
[6:36:55] Rudric_Ice: they should add dracthyr to PTR man
[6:37:25] Snabido: When a hub contains like multiple turn-ins Kreygasm
[6:37:35] AzerinSage: Arcanite! Arcanite! Arcanite Ripper HOOOOOOOOE!
[6:37:50] xxsargexx: i think they should've added a quest tracker for classic simply because you know a ton of people are just going to be using quest addons anyway
[6:38:15] razledazle1337: @91Niki I mean, you had to log in to battle net WoW website to sign up for beta :)
[6:38:29] Rev_4_Life: evokers need another change or two before adding to the ptr imo. Their essence spenders feel bad atm.
[6:38:36] zorantt: Rumors have it that you can play around with the customization when installing PTR (you click play while the game still installs). I personally haven't tried it, so I can't confirm
[6:38:37] zigzap0: Maybe they forgot lol
[6:38:37] 91Niki: @91Niki Right. But that is on their official website
[6:38:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: we have sparkles at least
[6:38:43] Tiamarilien: opt in is on the dragonflight page on blizzard website.

[6:44:02] Rudric_Ice: $200,000

[6:44:48] PokerFaceMoose: wowhead Annual Revenue     $10.0M - $15.0M
[6:44:50] Rudric_Ice: blizzard should just buy wowhead
[6:44:53] Deku_Scrub0: from wikipedia The website was discontinued on November 30, 2010 when its parent company, ZAM Network (now Fanbyte), merged it with its similar database website Wowhead.
[6:44:54] baaronthemonk: how many views do you think wowhead gets a day?
[6:44:55] Aidler: always more than you think with these things
[6:45:17] furiousee: 6 figures isn't much anymore
[6:45:22] MWilco77: Thottbot owner ZAM Network acquired the World of Warcraft database Wowhead in June 2007 for $1 million.[6][7][8][9] The website was discontinued on November 30, 2010. The website's URL now simply redirects the reader to Wowhead.[10] For a time, some pages of Thottbot were still able to be accessed through Wowhead, but on November 16, 2016, the Thottbot site was completely discontinued, and all Thottbot URLs began to forward to their equivalent pages on Wowhead.
[6:45:22] Funderik: what makes wowhead valuable tho, they  are not a profitable brand, they have mass ads for their revenue income.
[6:45:25] BlewGamingGroup: wowhead was originally sold for $1m to ZAM
[6:45:27] zorantt: The fact that Wowhead is endorsed by Blizzard itself, I would say at least $50 million+ to buy Wowhead
[6:45:29] Reaghol: Reaghol subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[6:46:14] Twips93: Swamp > Dustwallow > Hinterlands.
[6:46:17] OhHiImRob: if their annual revenue is 10-15 50 isn't out of the realm..
[6:46:18] PokerFaceMoose: @zorantt according to some website wowhead makes over 10mil a year in revenue
[6:46:18] onesadkeanu: wowhead would be worth quite a bit double digit millions ez
[6:46:22] xThebubbler: 2007
[6:46:27] CianoHD3: it was 2007
[6:46:32] furiousee: 2007
[6:46:32] Rudric_Ice: MMO champion tho
[6:46:38] BlewGamingGroup: june 07
[6:46:39] Lostdogal: wouldn't be far off $50 mil
[6:47:05] Funderik: how? what gives it that value?
[6:47:11] HaxzorJimDuggan: mmo champion is dollar store wowhead
[6:47:25] Kulture1: i used to only use MMO champ
[6:47:25] abracka_: if this website is accurate, it valued wowhead at 690K
[6:47:33] PokerFaceMoose: wowhead got over 40million hits in july
[6:47:36] Kulture1: I still kinda prefer how they do their posts over wowhead, they're just slow
[6:47:38] Rohen86: No that's Ice-Veins
[6:47:39] PokerFaceMoose: that gives it value
[6:47:44] KyleEverett: MMO-C was fine when Boub was in charge, but he got his payday and basically went off to do other things
[6:48:04] Funderik: @abracka_ i'd believe that over 10-15m any day.
[6:48:09] DiiscoViking: i see no booty
[6:48:09] zorantt: I use $50 million because Blizzard sends players there, increasing their revenue. If Blizzard didn't, I would say around $15 million
[6:48:12] PvtHudson093: MMOC is toxicity central
[6:48:13] razledazle1337: There's a website appraisal website that supposedly values wowhead at $439 milly lol, that'd be a dream if that was real
[6:48:16] GroovyBryan: Have you been keeping up with some of the stuff coming to new world?
[6:48:33] abracka_: @abracka_ yeah it's popular, but not that popular lol
[6:48:38] swervo61: They post "leaks" all the time that turn out to be inaccurate
[6:48:41] onesadkeanu: mmochampion is still worth low millions
[6:48:43] Rev_4_Life: True LUL
[6:48:47] beckett3a: pretty much yeah, full of shitheads
[6:48:48] KyleEverett: wowhead got bought out by the better company compared to mmo-c
[6:48:58] Zebingt0n: Wowhead  is the reddit and MMoChamp is 4chan ez comparison LUL

[6:51:32] ItsDerpDiggler: BABY ROOOF!

[6:51:35] abracka_: @angrynick1105 the heroic/epic upgrade editions will give you one level 70 boost. but you can play it just for the sub price, $15
[6:51:36] furiousee: It's not free lol
[6:51:43] angrynick1105: ah thanks. o lol
[6:51:44] Reaghol: i seen 4.. all in fp
[6:51:57] Kittastrophe: only way rarescanner works is if you mouse over the rare
[6:52:00] Nosdunk24: You can play the game with your normal sub
[6:52:37] Aidler: but you have a 60 DK very quickly

[6:57:50] Aethn: They are buying the database they dont care about he site.  The tracking info and otehr stuff for millions of visitors is a gold mine
[6:57:51] Epiclawlzable: I feel like that's kind of what Preach is doing with his new website
[6:57:54] pent217: You legit would make bank, but Rapp only gets his scoops early because the league approves everything he sends out
[6:58:12] Rudric_Ice: wowhead costs the same as Activision Kappa

[7:00:17] Phil87z: Nobbel is back making wow videos. I think dragon flight will bring them all back in some capacity
[7:00:19] Rudric_Ice: he's just a FF streamer now
[7:00:23] onesadkeanu: well Blizzard did that
[7:00:34] Nosdunk24: Bliz could learn  ALOT from FF
[7:00:52] Velirith: They always come back
[7:01:03] ArcaneSyntax: more wowwiki pages for Nobbel to read Pog
[7:01:04] KyleEverett: Nobbel was still hanging out on his island today, I think a lot of content creators will just do both these days
[7:01:20] LearnedSomething: they have the island now
[7:01:24] Lostdogal: imagine having a wow lore channel during shadowlands...must have been rough. Shadowlands hit them harder than covid
[7:01:29] michaelkn: i jsuyt cant imagine ff having a draw in the long term
[7:01:31] Phil87z: I took a break in 9.2 and powered through all of 14. Beat endwalker and am back to wow now

[7:02:46] ArcaneSyntax: I don't think Preach has done any raiding in more than 8 months
[7:03:10] JediNeo99999: Preach has said many times he plays off stream.
[7:03:19] Epiclawlzable: I don't think I could ever completely "cut the cord" on Wow.. at this point... I'm going to take a look at every expansion until they stop making them
[7:03:26] ChromaLife: hmm
[7:03:33] brumaldus: there's not much to be hardcore about FF though, once you're done with MSQ there's really not much to go on about
[7:03:45] dinomiyte: right, he can do what he wants lol..
[7:03:56] Rudric_Ice: preach was bald back in his WoW days now he has hair so now he's a FF main
[7:04:02] Nosdunk24: @brumaldus they don't have raids?
[7:04:09] Nico_vdM: It was very brave to switch to FF content
[7:04:22] Phil87z: He’s playing old FF games now
[7:04:50] gelimarr: LOTRO streamer is tougher
[7:05:00] brumaldus: they do, but that's about it. you raid 2-3 times a week, do your daily roulettes and beyond that you're done. with wow you can keep pushing keys for endgame content with actual combat, not so much on FF
[7:05:08] GamingDad77: or SWTOR
[7:05:12] KyleEverett: @Gemmeke EQ2 is where it's at for obscure streaming

[7:07:13] KyleEverett: At least people aren't just being a streamer/youtuber about vaporware mmos right? :D
[7:07:23] Rudric_Ice: so if I hop on and stream FF will I get 5k views on my first stream ? Kappa
[7:07:27] pent217: Towelliee ASMR streamer when?
[7:07:47] PhantomX_Destiny: @Towelliee The question is do you remember any of it?
[7:07:50] Nico_vdM: That is one of the reason why I dont plan on playing FF. I know that I won't be as interested about the story
[7:07:53] zorantt: Tomorrow, Towelliee will declare his's a Hello Kitty Adventure Island streamer :P
[7:08:00] gidgeet: I still think Guild Wars 2 is the most underrated MMO I am so enjoying it over FF and ESO. So much to do!
[7:08:28] Phil87z: The story in FF is cool but honestly it’s a single player rpg that makes you group up occasionally for me
[7:08:36] abracka_: they revamped it apparently
[7:08:52] LearnedSomething: I love gw2
[7:08:55] Velashen: Yeah GW2 is insanely solid.
[7:08:56] Deku_Scrub0: i just did the endwalker msq then started playing wow again, its been like 7 months since then
[7:08:56] gidgeet: Yeah I agree with that
[7:09:05] LearnedSomething: the story is fantastic, and the progression systems are fair
[7:09:09] xRykku: Its such a sleeper mmo
[7:09:11] Rudric_Ice: I'm just casually downloading guild wars on steam no expecting anything honestly
[7:09:11] Joe_Omaha: @Towelliee If someone were to boost a pally to 70, what would be the best way to gear up? Battlegrounds? Old raids/Dungeons?
[7:09:11] Revelations45: Revelations45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! O no I hit a button now my ass hurts.. need more towels for all the bleeding
[7:09:12] gidgeet: I am working on the My Story and it seems to go on forever lol
[7:09:13] abracka_: with the steam release they redid the leveling experience. you also get that raptor mount at level 10 now too
[7:09:14] LearnedSomething: wvw is so much fun too
[7:09:18] pythonzttv: Stuck deciding what class to role for dragonflight. Do you think warlock or mage is better for end game pve?
[7:09:19] TheSpace_Sloth: I'm playing GW2 right now at level 35 its fun so far but looking forward to getting through the base game and getting to the xpacs
[7:09:22] Nosdunk24: What happened to New World?
[7:09:29] Slitze: tf
[7:09:41] Nico_vdM: leave your group first
[7:09:54] Rudric_Ice: @nosdunk24  it's getting players again
[7:09:54] KyleEverett: oh hey
[7:10:06] KyleEverett: @Towelliee You can now queue for bgs anywhere
[7:10:08] gidgeet: @TheSpace_Sloth I just don't have the new expansion yet, will get it payday
[7:10:13] duffock: i remember when wrath came out someone didnt want to group for a named mob quest because they wanted the full exp from the kill
[7:10:16] TheSpace_Sloth: @pythonzttv warlock generally is always a safe pick and supposedly is looking strong right now
[7:10:17] michaelkn: I dont think new world is ever going to be big again
[7:10:39] zorantt: I miss Rift.
[7:10:58] zorantt: The original Rift. The rift now isn't the rift I played lol
[7:11:02] Bernardo994: they need to add daggers
[7:11:09] TheSpace_Sloth: @gidgeet nice I'm deciding which one to get first since I guess you don't have to go in "order" I'll probably go with the one that gives mounts.
[7:11:09] gidgeet: New World was fun, but I got bored quickly with it
[7:11:10] abracka_: i think it's going to start averaging around 60-90k with the updates coming, and future ones after that. scot lane said "i didn't hear no bell"
[7:11:14] itscityboy: people think every game has to have 500k players
[7:11:21] pythonzttv: @Towelliee Stuck deciding what class to role for dragonflight. Do you think warlock or mage is better for end game pve?
[7:11:22] Rudric_Ice: wrong if FF can make a comeback so can NW
[7:11:22] chinfu303: @michaelkn the player base has been going up for 2 weeks went from 14k to 40k
[7:11:25] Slitze: not gijrther
[7:11:34] Aidler: New World will never be as big again as it was and it doesn't need to. It just needs to make money for Amazon
[7:11:43] BaconBeardBro: New World gonna be the erectile dysfunction MMO. Sometimes it's huge.... Sometimes it shrivels up back inside you when you don't want it to.

[7:12:14] Nosdunk24: Isn't this a pvp server? Why not kill the draenei
[7:12:18] gidgeet: That's the First Expansion it gives you a Raptor mount.  But you can get the newest expansion you also get a mount I do believe.
[7:12:19] Nico_vdM: probably a spammable targeted macro
[7:12:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: give it away free to prime members one month would give it a boost
[7:12:24] ArcaneSyntax: pulling with earth shock is SUS
[7:12:28] Zedowel: target macro maybe? THat's how I tag everything
[7:12:37] orbiitz269: @Nosdunk24 it's not pvp

[7:13:52] gidgeet: The Mount system in Gw2 is amazing, so many different colors to unlock and styles for the main mount
[7:13:59] mulkon: Do New World servers still hold only 2k ppl? If yes thats a huge letdown for me, because the servers feel dead the moment some people stop playing.
[7:14:01] hammack52: @Towelliee is new world adding in vendors so you can sell the trash that no one wants so you can make a little money off of it
[7:14:02] Kittastrophe: i like this server, it's legit i think it's a good one for the long run
[7:14:18] hammack52: or is it still all player to player selling only

[7:14:51] Aethn: 70 people in every single town right now every day every hour, not a dead game
[7:15:00] kokochris: they feel alive, but not crowded.  its actually nice
[7:15:10] Kulture1: people are so obsessed with servers needing to have like ~50k people
[7:15:13] gold9871: Nodes are fec king contest like hell
[7:15:46] Cilir: god I haven't played new world because of the mess it was. I can't wait to see how they fixed a lot fo stuff and how it is now
[7:15:54] captain_khyzan: GW2 gave up on raids, fractals, and dungeons, its only endgame focus from here atm is strike which are 1 boss and stupid easy... the main reason i have permanently left for now...

[7:23:42] LearnedSomething: you could compare new world to any game and take that game's percent loss and put those two in the same X% to 100% bracket
[7:23:48] JackedDown: towCopium That's a HUGE difference
[7:24:11] XLcoj: Both dead yeah

[7:35:13] Prisana: So did blizzard keep all their previous game files stored in a database somewhere then to just roll these back out i can imagine they remade

[7:37:52] abracka_: it's insanely frustrating that it isn't there
[7:37:53] Macnerd1239: its literally insane i dont get it. they're pandering to a bunch of classic andy's
[7:37:56] Kneckt: ur right on the nail
[7:38:03] Skittlebeast: Because PVPers cry about everything and Blizzard gives it to them
[7:38:04] Aidler: towPog towHesaidit
[7:38:04] c0mmander_starscream: We're boomer level
[7:38:10] DeanoTV: i just wanna grind at get to max content
[7:38:13] nihilistic_bat: no changes amirite?
[7:38:15] Nico_vdM: So you can do that for BGs but not for dungeons? WTFF
[7:38:23] PvtPts: LUL
[7:38:26] GamingDad77: I am willing to bet all my channel points it happens BEFORE 3 months
[7:38:31] 3dRes: Old Towelliee? Sure
[7:38:38] c0mmander_starscream: peeveepeee
[7:38:44] HaxzorJimDuggan: leave the current LFG tool for the try hards looking for the perfect comp and give the LFD for us that just want to go asap
[7:38:49] KingoftheHatch: sup Towelliee
[7:38:52] Impaler99: IMO it takes away from the immersion for dungeons, which isnt really the same with bg since you can already queue and then dip, or have somebody in town queuing group.  Just my thoughts.
[7:38:55] Rudric_Ice: let's add raids too :)
[7:38:55] Ocenus: afk waiting on the queue to pop lol
[7:39:00] fbirobertmueller805: I heard they are going to Dmca video games! They want to make people get real jobs
[7:39:07] stallowned: peoples logic LUL
[7:39:08] Aidler: naguuraSmart
[7:39:21] MZorba: @Impaler99 +1
[7:39:30] Skittlebeast: Asking players to go back to a game before they fixed most of the issues is just silly
[7:39:39] nihilistic_bat: you can also queue for a dungeon, finish and dip
[7:39:41] Phil87z: I think they want the world to have people on it. Once LFD came out people we’re just power leveling in instances
[7:39:57] Twips93: I'm alright with no LFD at launch, but later down the line it 100% should be brought in.
[7:40:01] Taldemarr: When you return from a BG, you get teleported to the NPC that you from
[7:40:03] Aro725: RDF is wayyyyyy different than Raid finder. Thats what kinda ruined the game for me. Not RDF
[7:40:08] Impaler99: I'm not saying I'm for or against it, just think that is the logic.  Not really any immersion going into a bg.  Dunno.
[7:40:14] Epiclurker27893: Seems like some dev went to MMO champion as read a thread claiming that LFD destroyed the community
[7:40:17] Xan2008: goin to the entrance
