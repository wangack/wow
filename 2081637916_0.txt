[0:44:18] murasuo: Lontar is insane btw
[0:44:21] Polyrhythmz: Felt like they did infinitely more pressure to boomkin 2nd series
[0:44:21] provo2100: Lontar on Sewers wanted revenge on his oom 2v3 from Trill

[0:45:08] murasuo: There‚Äôs one for 300k next season no?
[0:45:10] Nemenon: was this blizzcon equivalent?
[0:45:13] terranapart: They got more aggressive on the 2nd series

[0:45:20] Vinserys: yo Martianpig A GOAT

[0:45:30] pavedsurface: why pres over rsham?
[0:45:32] Vinserys: he
[0:45:34] urchinlo: When you're evoker healing, are there specs that you match against that you can consistently blow out the water? (whether that be dps or heals)
[0:45:37] Brenanners: okay it seems there are just no dates that exist for cup 3/4 etc.
[0:45:40] Brenanners: so not even blizz knows
[0:45:40] Magottx: big props to not complaining about ping like at all. mucho respecto

[0:46:16] Aimed57: Did you guys consider mirroring?
[0:46:20] Nemenon: @verii I ask because we haven't really had a blizzcon tournament in a long time, and this felt like the closest

[0:46:23] EFFSIN: what about dh/rog @cdewx ?
[0:46:33] nameyourform: do you know why thug was playing bear? @cdewx
[0:46:35] murasuo: were you guys worried if you had to fight chibaku?
[0:46:35] beef_00: i think dh/rog was a missed opportunity
[0:46:40] davErosEe: you also lose on mana so may as well go evoker for earlier kill
[0:46:47] Zorthul_: dh/bomy?
[0:46:52] nz_jade: do we have the Audio from Trill 2v3
[0:47:02] deafnflaccid: @nameyourform couldnt get out of work so it was a troll..thats why he played bear according to ven
[0:47:15] nameyourform: ohhhh
[0:47:19] mayfire15: i felt like merces team didnt want to fight echos dh rogue with dh lock.
[0:47:20] nameyourform: makes sense
[0:47:28] Zenfuzz: Yo martian, go show trill some love bro lmao
[0:47:38] Vinserys: and oom
[0:47:41] mnowpsn: I think even casters said that was closer then the 4-1 showed
[0:47:54] Vinserys: but wouldnt have been cross kill if you had mana?
[0:48:04] JayBoogiex: yeah the 4-1 was misleading af those games were way closer than that
[0:48:09] NewDee: why was the dh the main kill target over the lock ?
[0:48:09] myodoctor: shoulda triple dh
[0:48:13] Aimed57: Does losing that 1st game really fuck shut up cause of ping?
[0:48:20] verii: i just figured the small map would make you want to cleave
[0:48:21] mayfire15: i jsut feel like it should have been good to switch it up
[0:48:27] murasuo: Cdew were you guys worried if you had to fight chibaku or were you rdy for them?
[0:48:38] EFFSIN: Dont u ever think like maybe we should try dh/rog first game ? since first series was tough
[0:48:45] c10starburst: were you considering swapping to shaman at all ?
[0:48:59] revid21: Chan had a really good breakdown of the games and lots of compliments for you guys.   They wanted to run RLS
[0:49:13] Ormand_: what is the counter to dh/rogue?
[0:49:13] reklebin: all i know is you gotta good left hook bud
[0:49:26] provo2100: There is no shame at losing to Echo, neither would it be the other way around. You are both at such a high level that it's the smallest of things that can swing a game
[0:49:33] Relzahtv: VoHiYo
[0:49:35] mnowpsn: @revid21 is that from today's vod?
[0:49:47] flapperstv: axd

[0:49:53] marcdf111: the first series against echo i was fucking screaming lolol crazy games
[0:49:54] amgine04: does anyone know if the chair is ok tho
[0:49:54] Karaelolz: what if you played pres dh rogue, how can they counter that
[0:49:56] Ormand_: makes sense
[0:50:10] Wicks_TV: It was an awesome Tourney
[0:50:14] hoaylander: why would you be ashamed my g those games were some of the best games the game has seen
[0:50:15] c10starburst: I mean the games were nuts
[0:50:16] EFFSIN: if rog counters pres why didnt the pick rog lock
[0:50:17] warbux2: Is there anymore tournies?
[0:50:25] provo2100: Anyways, NA or EU whatever. Amazing games and I think all us viewers should just be thankful that we get games at this quality
[0:50:30] revid21: Chan said they literally chickened out of RLS at the last minute
[0:50:37] gsr_: was a windwalker ret a option as a cleave?
[0:50:41] umcharama: @cdew - Congrats on second place. You guys were great throughout the tourney. Why did you choose to play evoker in the finals?
[0:50:49] hyperdogxx: @cdewx how was the hooligans team ?
[0:50:56] NewDee: why was the dh the main kill target over the lock ?
[0:51:01] gibboking: your healing in that 2vs3 game was absolutely insane, how you kept them both up is insane
[0:51:04] ImbaxTV: What was the ping on EU servers for you guys?
[0:51:15] jporter_: chan is so good
[0:51:18] provo2100: Typhoon and Snowball as executes is new meta
[0:51:19] ably: Loved watching pres evoker at awc @cdewx good stuff
[0:51:20] thgcm: @cdewx you think the meta will change a lot?
[0:51:20] sixthycent: you had a good time tho?
[0:51:26] zachgamegodx: those 3 portal with the essence break goes
[0:51:27] papagoog: the thing about boomy rogue is that even if its slightly a partially losing matchup, but its an extremley solid comp even into tough ones
[0:51:28] zachgamegodx: so crazy
[0:51:30] sixthycent: gettin to hang out with the boys
[0:51:30] Swishinn: 2 more cups in DF s4

[0:52:11] mctinyy: Next season Evoker will be crazy. Insta living flame is back bby!
[0:52:13] Polyrhythmz: Oh boy. Idk if I can take much longer without changes
[0:52:14] Vinserys: it definitely felt like when yall were switching between lock/dh was helping tho, more clones going out
[0:52:25] mayfire15: 10.2.6 could have changes
[0:52:29] Swishinn: eu chair confirmed
[0:52:31] hoaylander: TIER SET
[0:52:32] veklor24: LUL
[0:52:37] EFFSIN: u and sam with the bare feet gaming lol
[0:52:42] Dizzlx: @bmunny911 gearing has never been easier
[0:52:43] mong00sebite: who do you think the move get for their 4th so they can be less of a 1-trick?
[0:52:48] GLYFEnation: Did you think about using the old school Blizzcon champ comp? Boomy, DH, Sham?
[0:52:51] nikthevoker: was hoping to see some DH/outlaw
[0:52:51] zachgamegodx: i think they will nerf living flame to compensate for the tier coming back
[0:52:54] mvpala_tv: yo dew do you have an addon that shows all debuffs on party members rather than specific ones?
[0:52:56] Walkaz321: @bmunny911 Very easy to get geared

[0:53:57] mnowpsn: @dizzlx the legendary Hpal?
[0:53:57] mayfire15: mes needs to be more comfortable on his classes he is playing. he didnt seem it before yall left
[0:54:12] c10starburst: I miss mes DK
[0:54:17] ChumpSeason: Chan is scary on lock. not sure you could have trained lontar much as that
[0:54:31] Blastr12: what was your biggest take away???
[0:54:35] revid21: Chan said Mes took his job because he just wants to sit on the bench and chill with a good team LUL
[0:54:38] Azmir: you guys will
[0:54:46] hyperdogxx: do you miss facing MLD comp?
[0:54:47] EFFSIN: how did yall react 2 the move announcement ?

[0:54:52] Vigi9413: Sam is a precog master

[0:55:45] zachgamegodx: you coulda been scummy and only played boomy rogue with ping advantage, glad u didnt
[0:55:46] tcyronek0: non, tourny question if u dont mind me asking, What do you think about Blue Dragon Soles on a priest?
[0:55:48] zachgamegodx: that woulda been lame
[0:55:57] wilybob: Wp the games was so fire!
[0:55:57] qkmood: honestly i prefer when a team tries to all in 1 or 2 comps
[0:56:00] Vigi9413: hoolibang had like 300ms and still showed out
[0:56:09] DontDv8: The Move tried boomy rogue and lost
[0:56:11] Semis394: is it something you have noticed the team plays better 2nd time into you guys?
[0:56:16] EFFSIN: how did yall react 2 the move announcement ?

[0:58:28] c10starburst: @Kazoul13 nah he plays ret,warrior,DH
[0:58:31] Semis394: do you think rsham was not going to make any difference than pres? in those matchups?

[0:59:35] sugekite: ppl are sleeping on that fire breath

[1:00:01] gibboking: supatease absolutely lost his mind commentating
[1:00:03] Karaelolz: you did outdamage them I saw it
[1:00:07] ChumpSeason: u actually out mana'd lontar on a game or two as pres
[1:00:10] marcdf111: yea the dmg from pres was insane
[1:00:12] jo4sho85: you did 5 mil dmg one round
[1:00:14] Knaxxis: do u think dh needs an overall base dmg nerf or just certain abilities need a big nerf like the hunter etc.
[1:00:14] powerpigs: where does pres evokers dmg come from?
[1:00:17] stonedboodah: have u watched it back yet?
[1:00:25] Knaxxis: hunt*

[1:00:28] bpressure: Did you see all the Wow Chat saying check Cdews computer for the dmg you did
[1:00:29] infraredpen: @MoeJoJo he said earlier in his stream that he had bad buffs. his big dam came from getting a restealth off of the fear
[1:00:32] zachgamegodx: u did alot of dmg but sam was not able to do good dmg in those games so makes a good case for a comp swap
[1:00:38] Vigi9413: seems like nobody but you plays a good pres
[1:00:40] Brenanners: you might next season
[1:00:40] nameyourform: more healers should do more dmg, more shuffle pops
[1:00:42] MoeJoJo: @infraredpen ooof insane
[1:00:54] Kazoul13: was Taylor Swift at the AWC though?
[1:00:59] thgcm: @cdewx best healer s4 prediction?

[1:01:04] Polyrhythmz: Merce played crazy
[1:01:09] Vigi9413: is the grand final gonna be cross region?
[1:01:14] OphidianFX: seems like your better off if go down to the lower bracket and fight back up
[1:01:16] Knaxxis: I felt that second series , Sam was just getting pummeled non stop - but I am just a humble viewer
[1:01:18] Vinserys: Azael BibleThump BibleThump dewFam

[1:01:35] ItzSmuggs: Was there talk to change opener? Chan trinket beam every opener to inferno stun. or would it have made a dif?
[1:01:39] flamingirafe: flamingirafe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 79 months! 
[1:01:53] NewDee: would dh/boomy work in that scenario?
[1:01:55] nameyourform: the moves first game into echo looked so good. they were smoking then, but then wiz died, after that I feel like it took the breath out of them and the jelly drama too I‚Äôm sure @cdewx
[1:01:55] Karaelolz: on the second series echo was on fucking point with interrupting sam. He couldn't fake for his life
[1:02:05] jonpalisoc: didnt upper winners used to have a 1 game lead or someting, what do you think about that?
[1:02:08] heho1231: b racket reset would only make sense if they satyed bo5 probably
[1:02:23] Knaxxis: lontar said himself kicking Sam is like impossible
[1:02:32] ChumpSeason: Chan using trinket on the root beam openers was fat value
[1:02:35] freeoh: i like the tourny formats where winner bracket gets a game up advantage
[1:02:46] nameyourform: Sam had some sick typhoons
[1:02:48] 4chinit: what do you think about hoolibang's priest?
[1:02:49] EFFSIN: Wait i heard u keep points next season isnt that fried ?
[1:02:53] fatlittlepaypig: it's good in fighting games
[1:02:58] OphidianFX: the series you won against echo was amazing
[1:02:59] heho1231: did you guys keep ping advantage because of upper bracket or was it just because of seeding thing?
[1:03:01] veltrinor: its not an advantage tho its just the same rule everyone else had
[1:03:09] gibboking: i think losers should have to win to 3 twice
[1:03:10] jasonkbkt: That so fucked
[1:03:15] azael: I like Bo7 grand finals w/ 1 game advantage from upper bracket
[1:03:15] Tereekel: Ggs in the tourney, you guys played amazing but echo just had too much momentum from the lower bracket. Next time!
[1:03:26] gibboking: its how it used to be specially in cdl
[1:03:27] mayfire15: @cdewx i wonder why merce's team didnt wanna fight echos dh rogue with dh lock
[1:03:34] Knaxxis: yeah that series vs echo was the best series I‚Äôve ever seen I was driving and had to keep pulling over into plazas to watch lol
[1:03:43] maleficy: coming back from losers bracket can be more difficult than finals, i think putting them at disadvantage is weird
[1:03:44] azael: It's way better, you have to win 3, they win 4 not a crazy advantage but it's SOMETHING
[1:03:45] fatlittlepaypig: 2 series makes sense though because it turns it into a bo3 overall
[1:03:55] allstarkeung: Seems like a lot of games, it must be exhausting
[1:03:55] gibboking: just think the winners bracket get out of rythym waiting around
[1:04:00] MoeJoJo: Honestly blizz needs to put money into the comps more and make a LAN
[1:04:01] worbital: I‚Äôm starting as priest now.. (first char as healer) would you recommend disc or holy for pvp?
[1:04:03] ChumpSeason: UB team plays one less series, so that is an advantaged in a way
[1:04:11] gcchrille: Yo cdew, why didn't you swap to shaman during tourney?
[1:04:17] realfitty: Bro what I come in here to continue my Twitch prime only to find Martian gifted me one
[1:04:20] Knaxxis: I mean the viewership and interest is there Blizzards needs to wake up
[1:04:21] jasonkbkt: Literally not lose a single match and lose to the people you beat
[1:04:22] serverfirst300003: it should have reset when they w on first time and you should have played again, since they were coming from losers
[1:04:23] Vigi9413: why doesn‚Äôt the upper bracket winner not have to lose twice?
[1:04:26] DontDv8: @worbital disc for 2s, holy for 3s
[1:04:27] qkmood: am i getting senile i thought fuseton was a dh or something

[1:06:17] Kazoul13: what if the move recruits snutz, he can play literally anything
[1:06:22] gcchrille: Do you not have any other comps with mes maybe?
[1:06:25] Bronloch: was there a single Hpally in the tourney?
[1:06:26] unsccessful: chat is the new season tomorrow? Û†ÄÄ

[1:07:02] Tereekel: I didn't realize Grand finals wasn't cross region, that sucks
[1:07:06] allstarkeung: Why did you guys not want to wargames your main comp into Echo?
[1:07:07] worbital: would u recommend disc or holy for beginners?

[1:08:26] Kazoul13: snutz can play any class at r1+ @Knaxxis
[1:08:27] Tereekel: I'm much more into the games when it's cross region. Something about it makes it feel more interesting

[1:08:45] bpainn: stormrage is bis
[1:08:48] DontDv8: tich is goated

[1:09:33] Vigi9413: Ven mentioned he‚Äôd like an east coast tourney server for cross region
[1:09:44] ChumpSeason: WC would be like 300 on eu servers yeah?
[1:09:56] Tereekel: @addyz0r it definitely can play a role if you're on double your usual ping
[1:09:58] Knaxxis: blizzard is tripping not doing a tournament at blizzcon
[1:09:59] frozoneee: holy fuck Martian

[1:11:11] Hemmis7: Lava lava didnt win a single game on NA ping KEKW
[1:11:11] Karaelolz: AWC peaked at 27k viewers when you and echo played on the first series
[1:11:15] Karaelolz: it was EU prime time
[1:11:24] Knaxxis: imagine how hyped that 2v3 woulda been at blizzcon @cdewx
[1:11:25] Bronloch: yea people dont understand that 50ms is NOTHING when there are 1,000ms in 1 sec

[1:12:01] tommymage: @cdewx you prob answered this but thoughts on hoolibang?  comp is so stressful to face
[1:12:02] Bowser20FTW: @venruki ready for next AWC season already
[1:12:06] provo2100: Correct me if I'm wrong. Next cup/tournament will "only" feature it's on regional teams right? Like an NA one and a EU one?

[1:12:53] Bronloch: LUL you are deluding yourself dude if you think you can recognize 50ms @gcchrille
[1:12:59] Tereekel: I hope they rethink Grands as cross region I think they'd get much more viewer turnout, especially after how hype mid season was
[1:13:16] Knaxxis: man that moment woulda been so insane at blizzcon dude - blizzard has to see that
[1:13:19] Daydash_Gaming: that last game was there any talks in switching to mes and benching sam?
[1:13:19] Magottx: unfort the move was not exactly on their A- game.
[1:13:26] jfachal: hey Cdew congrats on 2nd place. great matches to watch on Twitch man, exhilarating.  any class changes you think coming soon ?
[1:13:27] Bowser20FTW: @cdewx wait..
[1:13:33] EFFSIN: SoD tourney postpone u thinking about doing it now @cdewx ?

[1:13:57] santymikey: quick question for my pro players, how do you auto accept quests without using mouse? üëÄ
[1:14:02] Knaxxis: DH is just too strong rn
[1:14:04] provo2100: @venruki Will next tourny be separated regional cups? Instead of cross-over like we just had?
[1:14:10] santymikey: I see a lot of people doing it
[1:14:10] Shablagoosh: I think we wont get any changes til end of expac just like shadowlands s4
[1:14:10] Vigi9413: blizz gonna give DH the DK treatment
[1:14:12] papagoog: i heard jelly was going to EU
[1:14:18] PeptoAbysmal: which classes do you think need the most attention? @cdewx
[1:14:19] thgcm: @cdewx next season healer meta predictions?
[1:14:21] jfachal: we need more EU vs NA
[1:14:28] EFFSIN: it was cool all u together u think u would do it for na vs na ?
[1:14:33] Valvax: hopefully
[1:14:33] Knaxxis: this tourney felt like I was watching Blizzcon tbh and the casters were fucking INSANE
[1:14:38] santoriu: i wish they revamp caster MW tired of fisting so hard
[1:14:39] Tereekel: I think they're just focusing on war within and live is kinda just back burner rn.
[1:14:41] ChumpSeason: blizz can i just get a 5% dmg nerf on eye beam or something lol
[1:14:41] Bowser20FTW: LAN would be crazy
[1:14:45] santymikey: apparently there‚Äôs going to be a frost healer coming out tmmr‚Ä¶ idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[1:53:40] Karaelolz: i'd hate to play fistweave too, you need to play it so much to get a muscle memory on how long can your team survive when you don't have something to hit
[1:53:54] zen_oni_shinobi: fistweaver is pretty much the solo remnant of every legion class. meaning every class was god king tier. dragonflight has fistweaver.
[1:54:34] zen_oni_shinobi: could have simplified that statement looking back on it.  my bad on that.
[1:54:37] Semis394: i think what i noticed in last series was lontar was not passive healing .. he was more active with lasso and disruptive for your goes. which made it harder

[4:18:27] marcdf111: @katana_rider he said they were only getting like 100 ping and he plays wiht 70ish so it didnt matter to them
[4:18:51] katana_rider: Thanks. I wasn't sure how real it was but the broadcast kept bringing it up.

[4:19:53] D_Tram: not trying to wreck teams but i wanna see a crazy team / tourney where its just mixed up... no teams set until the rounds are finalized.. obvi one healer and 2 dps.. like an off szn AWC where competitors get a shot at proving skill maybe no necessarily comp picks
[4:21:12] D_Tram: i agree
[4:21:24] D_Tram: lontar dew sterg fueston
[4:21:25] katana_rider: They should make the dps fight in an irl arena to make teams

[4:23:24] TimmyShoes: what's the easiest healer to play? i suck at all of them but maybe there's an easy one lol
[4:23:27] D_Tram: tru but... chan just bis
[4:23:37] synzebru: multiclasser also more valuable in draft world too prob
[4:23:48] D_Tram: @TimmyShoes depends what youre going for.. LF fun and trying to learn or trying to push and trying to be the best?
[4:23:54] thejudge1904: who do you think are the better rogues rn
[4:24:02] Steely97x: gz on 2nd
[4:24:05] D_Tram: @synzebru TRUUUU unless you pick wazz pika trill

[4:27:12] D_Tram: Trill being anything im happyt boi
[4:27:21] RTienx: That comeback on 2v3 was sick üëç
[4:27:28] D_Tram: Trill does the most lolol.. nah it woulda been dbl melee sub sam for mes
[4:27:41] micomaster: i think you want trill on any class lol
[4:27:44] zachgamegodx: you guys are the cc masters
[4:27:52] D_Tram: i think game 2 woulda been huge against raiku to go TWD
[4:27:53] torzzttv: Kalvish in your top 4?
[4:27:54] adheree: Whaz?
[4:28:11] Riddrik: trills damage is insane, dont think ive ever seen a player min/max that well
[4:28:12] stinkmemerr: i remember during wod your thing was to dampen out them out
[4:28:25] Crakkeh: that's the beauty of rogue
[4:28:33] Crakkeh: it's not super one dimensional
[4:28:46] TimmyShoes: is Hpal harder than disc priest or Rsham? I'm assuming it's way easier than Rsham.
[4:28:49] TheUlaine: 1. Pika 2. Trill 3. Kal 4. Whazz 5. Palu
[4:28:57] RTienx: was surprised you guys didn‚Äôt tagged in Mes as DH  on final round. Rogue+DH+Shanmy could beat Echo
[4:29:09] zachgamegodx: palumor is not on that list haha @theulaine
[4:29:12] fefefen: 1. pshero 2. trill 3. whaazz 4. palu 5. pika
[4:29:17] adheree: Whazz on 4 is crazy
[4:29:29] citricxy: @theulaine palu is not even top 10

[4:30:24] zachgamegodx: 1. pshero 2. trill 3. palumar (pesimar) 4.  Tony rogue (right move) 5. mespera
[4:30:32] Cocoapuffs1: you didnt tho
[4:30:33] Crakkeh: Reckful
[4:30:52] Curtbrainfre3z: imagineif switfy had 10 fingers bro,he would be unstopable
[4:31:05] zachgamegodx: swifty did have 10 fingers at a time
[4:31:11] ascherxo: @Curtbrainfre3z exactly. Like the infinity gauntlet
[4:31:16] zachgamegodx: he says it doesn‚Äôt feel any different
[4:31:19] marcdf111: i think trill is the best rogue for liquid but i think pika is the most flexible who could play with any other team
[4:31:28] inamori1: Kalimist needs a mention when we talk rogues
[4:31:38] seregaboglolaxxx: who won world gauntlet boys?
[4:31:44] lycansong: "you're only as good as your last fight"
[4:32:13] ascherxo: cant talk rogues without oilman
[4:32:28] inamori1: omg woundman
[4:32:30] inamori1: trueeeee
[4:32:39] zachgamegodx: pika hasn‚Äôt won any  major champs in past 4 expacs  @marcdf111 he doesn‚Äôt rly belong in the conversations of best atm
[4:32:43] TheUlaine: Actually, Vestheta at my number 5
[4:33:02] inamori1: Wound man turtles all day though :P
[4:33:10] Fler760: what about dh boomy?
[4:33:18] torzzttv: @zachgamegodx has the meta included rogues?
[4:33:21] fefefen: whos best rogue is as important as whos best at taking out the trash, rogue is mage pet
[4:33:36] deanoxs: man i miss rsham already LUL
[4:33:43] Cocoapuffs1: @zachgamegodx crazy take
[4:33:47] Brenanners: @zachgamegodx by that logic im assuming you dont put wiz in top 5 sp and sterge in top 5 healer?
[4:33:52] rainmannxz: Pika's in a different dimension
[4:33:55] D_Tram: @cdewx is there not a world where you guys create the window for trill to one shot in a duel or something as sub??
[4:34:02] kakichoco: are they doing some team reshaping..
[4:34:16] lazyturtle0824: @zachgamegodx that‚Äôs insanely dumb logic
[4:34:17] D_Tram: yeah seems that way j/w
[4:34:30] Twinklefairyx: I ZOLO THIS GUY
[4:34:35] buffevoker: @Brenanners No one else is playing Sp than wiz so he can be top 5, and no sterge aint top 5 healer

[4:35:53] kakichoco: it is so weird they kick jellybeans off after all these years..
[4:35:55] zachgamegodx: I don‚Äôt put sterge as best shaman and I think prev was better sp than wiz
[4:36:14] zachgamegodx: but bc there‚Äôs barely any sps you can say wiz is best now that prev is gone
[4:36:16] flaccidx: people most likely down playing pikas rogue because sub isn‚Äôt the top spec atm
[4:36:22] TheUlaine: @deanoxs Basically a clothy

[5:01:04] Tjaktv: ceralium
[5:01:05] DontDv8: pika said he talked to xar
[5:01:07] vaighnthemage: Think a wizard would be nice
[5:01:14] marcdf111: snutz would actually be insane
[5:01:17] relaywow: They should poach Dipi
[5:01:24] flixbus1234: Aeghis
[5:01:26] RHYNOOOOOO: who left the move
[5:01:27] deafnflaccid: xar makes wayyy to much money from classic
[5:01:29] storm_chaser_ron: Xar would be a weird fit anyway
[5:01:30] torzzttv: ive never heard that phrase
[5:01:34] deafnflaccid: no shot he goes retail until next xpac
[5:01:36] marcdf111: they need a raiku mage/dh imo
[5:01:37] torzzttv: I would bet my dick on it :D
[5:01:41] Aro725: you got 3 kids you dont need that thing anymore LUL

[5:02:14] Aro725: he like stopped streaming too, said he was getting an irl job to focus on or something
[5:02:15] Fliigh7z: jah gonna get unbanned and become gg 4th
[5:02:18] Brenanners: hes got some gig with fansly goin on
[5:02:22] Linder8260: @cdewx didnt he win like a lot of money of classic?
[5:02:26] storm_chaser_ron: jah is an awful fit for the move guys
[5:02:37] storm_chaser_ron: they're not gonna bring in a turbo-toxic to sit bench 4th
[5:02:48] Aro725: @storm_chaser_ron pika and jah played together back in the day
[5:02:50] qkmood: jah is friends with sterge and wiz at least
[5:03:02] torzzttv: I dont think Jah is a good fit for anyone
[5:03:07] Aro725: Chanimal
[5:03:08] rainmannxz: how can anyone not be friends with Pika lmao
[5:03:10] storm_chaser_ron: @Aro725 right but what is he adding to the roster besides mage? you cant have a 1 trick mage these days
[5:03:11] DontDv8: jah is so toxic
[5:03:19] storm_chaser_ron: so he brings bad vibes and 1 class?
[5:03:38] Karaelolz: Lmao
[5:03:38] Aro725: oh i dont disagree at all
[5:03:41] Cocoapuffs1: jah plays more than 1 class
[5:03:43] D_Tram: NGL ithe Kevin Hart commercial came on talking about team and all that right when you cut out hahaha
[5:03:45] zagabombs: Did jelly get lobbed or something?
[5:03:46] storm_chaser_ron: kubzy makes sense in terms of standard fit but feels like a weird personality fit
[5:03:50] D_Tram: couldnt be more perf
[5:03:52] Fliigh7z: can you have 2 different healers?
[5:04:20] D_Tram: @zagabombs its just time to have jelly move on... he needs more room for his wingspan to spread brother
[5:04:26] vodin__: yo gz on the tourney man, know it wasn't 1st but the entertainment was through the roof
[5:04:35] austin_545: @storm_chaser_ron he is a great multiclasser. but his vibes are rough
[5:04:40] rembrandt89: theres not alot of players left really
[5:04:50] D_Tram: @Fliigh7z you could but better to have a multi healer than a multi classeer dps/healer
[5:04:52] D_Tram: most times
[5:04:53] Moobot: Latest YT Video: Resto Druid is BROKEN | Cdew Highlights - youtu.be/iwiHFSbJNhA
[5:05:30] storm_chaser_ron: @austin_545 I just don't think he has the track record on anything but mage, and the move doesn't really like going alt heavy it seems

[5:05:39] eepshays: wasnt pika and jah on a team before?
[5:05:41] D_Tram: youd want your DPS to for the most part have DPS under controll and just have the healer know the healers
[5:05:47] vaighnthemage: I miss kubzy the resto druid
[5:05:59] storm_chaser_ron: @eepshays yes they were on tempo storm with gore but that team broke up despite doing very well
[5:06:25] D_Tram: @eepshays in ancient times lol.. started watching and keeping up in 2019 so maybe xD
[5:06:38] vaighnthemage: Jah is really good on feral and spriest I'm sure he can lock
[5:06:54] D_Tram: @storm_chaser_ron youre soooooo right lol.. what a dream team that woulda been.. wouldnt trade it for my Move now tho
[5:06:58] storm_chaser_ron: well spriest isnt adding anything for them lol they have the goated one
[5:07:30] beef_00: that a big sluuuurp
[5:07:33] D_Tram: @storm_chaser_ron tru tho.. literal trill of SP on the team but just have that small gap thats only visible in high rated matches that makes it a bad match up
[5:07:34] storm_chaser_ron: feral is never good long enough and you need a hunter for the only real awc level comp, it never seems to have viability in other stuff
[5:07:40] Aro725: Yo maybe they recruit Bean, what you think about that Chuck?
[5:07:41] storm_chaser_ron: idk how that group all breaks out, but if they're bringing in a mage player, wouldn't it most likely be rositajonez?
[5:07:45] storm_chaser_ron: rositajones*
[5:07:58] Cocoapuffs1: jah is better multi classer than rosita
[5:08:05] D_Tram: @storm_chaser_ron FMP but theres about 3-4 other comps that are better for the healer and mage before then lol
[5:08:08] Rekkil: Do you know how mitch is doing? I miss his streams ;(
[5:08:10] Aro725: LUL
[5:08:13] D_Tram: they are scared to buff feral to where it needs to be
[5:08:14] storm_chaser_ron: yeah but rosita was recently affiliated with the team and has competed more recently than jah
[5:08:19] storm_chaser_ron: and rosita's teams weren't doing bad
[5:08:20] Karaelolz: beansGasm
[5:08:24] buttercps: mitch moved to canada apparently
[5:08:29] storm_chaser_ron: mitch is in canada somewhere
[5:08:37] D_Tram: just look at classic or sod, they give them WF they in every grp .. they give them the ability to sunfire in cat.. they in every BG
[5:08:41] D_Tram: feral a fickle bitch
[5:08:48] lukaripnwx: train got him a place prolly
[5:08:49] pretty_ryan: on that poker grind
[5:08:50] storm_chaser_ron: ven said mitch told him he wanted to be cold and alone lol
[5:08:55] buttercps: he asked if wow was playable in canada LULW
[5:08:57] storm_chaser_ron: (and wants to be far away from austin)
[5:08:58] D_Tram: Mitch needs to stop involving himself w/ these streamers on OTK
[5:09:01] pretty_ryan: and by grind i mean he'll be back in 6 months
[5:09:07] Tropezqt: LUL
[5:10:07] vaighnthemage: Also heard the move was considering replacing wizk if talbadar comes out of retirement
[5:10:43] D_Tram: nahhhhhh Wizzk lockkddd
[5:10:53] Cocoapuffs1: @vaighnthemage EleGiggle
[5:10:56] storm_chaser_ron: clear bait

[5:11:13] D_Tram: Whizz the Trill of The Move
[5:11:16] D_Tram: he aint goin no where
[5:11:28] Aro725: @vaighnthemage Yeah I heard Ven was going to stop casting and go back to competing as well Kappa
[5:12:06] marcdf111: @Aro725 naw naw azael was gonna quit LCS casting to come back lololol
[5:12:13] beef_00: shidding them wraths out
[5:12:17] D_Tram: Smexxin Chan Snutz and Dewland lol
[5:12:27] Aro725: @marcdf111 LUL
[5:12:32] D_Tram: @marcdf111 TRUUUUU
[5:12:56] storm_chaser_ron: I bet if the move had to replace (I think they'll just leave it open) and could get anybody for that spot it'd be yam
[5:13:14] storm_chaser_ron: that's the *actual* great fit
[5:13:16] Tikz29: Tikz29 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! dewFam
[5:13:23] storm_chaser_ron: never gonna happen ofc
[5:13:23] rainmannxz: Mes OMEGALUL
[5:13:27] D_Tram: yeah i think its Xaryus spot but hes Dading out rn and not going to take it (with all due respect)
[5:13:30] Guidoare: cdew + jahmilli yin and yang ideal wow combination? order vs chaos
[5:13:48] D_Tram: lol
[5:13:50] Guidoare: send him a dm and give him a cuddle
[5:13:54] Aro725: Does destro just never press chaos bolt anymore?
[5:13:54] D_Tram: yeah Xar wont do it
[5:13:57] D_Tram: i know
[5:14:07] D_Tram: saying i respect his fatherly position... that doesnt matter tho
[5:14:14] D_Tram: he could stil bne the best mage
[5:14:17] knadam13: he would do it if mage was good and retail was popular
[5:14:17] storm_chaser_ron: and he has a young child, not exactly great timing to completely shift up your schedule
[5:14:19] Fostethesnowman: How we doing dewFam
[5:14:33] D_Tram: 100p
[5:14:37] D_Tram: youre right dew
[5:14:41] emaxxx1988: @cdewx how do you find the lack of haste? do you think 27 vers/mastery with less haste is better?
[5:14:41] rainmannxz: Noirmist
[5:14:43] peatear19: jah to the move confirmed
[5:14:44] D_Tram: SAM JUUUUUNNNNNEEEE
[5:14:47] Brenanners: you gonna loan sam to them?
[5:14:48] vaighnthemage: It's not a mage it's Jah and aeghis king wizards
[5:14:51] runnnnnit: the move?
[5:14:55] D_Tram: NEEDS TO MULTI CLASS THAT BEAR FORM THOOOOO
[5:15:01] Cocoapuffs1: jah is similar to sam with classes he plays his biggest issue is being banned lol
[5:15:01] Fostethesnowman: @peatear19 I should time you out for that Kappa
[5:15:03] Linder8260: sam is working right?
[5:15:07] storm_chaser_ron: just let both teams have yam on a timeshare
[5:15:12] storm_chaser_ron: its like ping advantage
[5:15:22] Aro725: When you breaking out Cbrew?
[5:15:26] storm_chaser_ron: higher seed gets yam for nagrand
[5:15:26] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:15:29] knadam13: will vanguards ever compete?
[5:15:37] D_Tram: they need to make pika play something other than rogue.. 19 years practice on 1 calss is enough lol
[5:15:51] storm_chaser_ron: @D_Tram he does, they just don't trust alt comps that much
[5:15:57] torzzttv: so they should
[5:15:59] Linder8260: @cdewx any shamans in the lair this exp? or have u only played druid and the other new dragon class?
[5:16:04] vaighnthemage: Vanguards yoske and crusader we're gonna run it next awc
[5:16:05] TheUlaine: @knadam13 Kinda, he did during VoidGG Tourny's
[5:16:05] storm_chaser_ron: pika is insane on warr and ele
[5:16:06] Aro725: @knadam13 I dont think so, he works on production for AWC.
[5:16:13] torzzttv: Druids are scummy :D
[5:16:34] Cocoapuffs1: @D_Tram rogue is just always good for tournament play and pika is 1 of the best in the game
[5:16:38] Juliio29: idk if you‚Äôve answered this or not, but how come we didn‚Äôt bring our king Mes to cleave?
[5:16:43] blackrose111111111: Hello cdew how are u?
[5:16:46] D_Tram: @storm_chaser_ron i know bro trust thats why Jelly never got to play lol... j/s thats whats going to push them over the top
[5:16:51] theblacksheep231: what do you think has been the best team you've played on dew
[5:17:05] VUFFERDUFFER: POGGERS
[5:17:06] Aro725: I cant wait for mop classic to play Mistweaver. Going to be so sick
[5:17:08] Fostethesnowman: safe answer
[5:17:17] nz_jade: not bean
[5:17:19] emaxxx1988: @cdewx crazy how Dannycary plays with like 10% vers a lot
[5:17:22] Bworried: stop ! lol
[5:17:22] D_Tram: @Cocoapuffs1 i know bruv trust i know hes best on rogue just saying if they force him to get better on 1 or 2 other classes they infinietly increase chances of success
[5:17:24] vjsnakefarm: wish wow prize pools were half a mili
[5:17:32] Aro725: Cdews favorite teamate was Bean for sure
[5:17:34] D_Tram: especially since he gimps himself on addones
[5:17:36] horowind: Whats r the best comps for rdruid rn besides destro/dh?
[5:17:41] Linder8260: i remeber when Deathing a sheep was a big thing
[5:17:41] nz_jade: he misses bean
[5:17:44] Karaelolz: beansKO
[5:17:48] runnnnnit: @cdewx yall did great in awc <3
[5:17:49] kisnouxd: best but lost to eu
[5:17:50] storm_chaser_ron: It's not about individual players on the move playing alts, its about them feeling practiced enough to be better on a non-RPS comp as a group
[5:17:50] theblacksheep231: snutz smexxin bean loss still hurts <3
[5:17:50] iLLwiLL_HS: even out comped i really thought you guys were going to win
[5:17:52] D_Tram: @horowind rmd
[5:18:04] nz_jade: beansKO beansKO beansKO beansKO

[5:18:07] Linder8260: or chaos bolts
[5:18:14] Linder8260: today its another level.
[5:18:22] theblacksheep231: @D_Tram i think it was whaaz
[5:18:35] Fostethesnowman: Azael and Woundman is the answer chat

[5:25:42] D_Tram: if it were whazz chan or whazz raiku youre right
[5:25:55] vodin__: what
[5:25:59] D_Tram: Raiku would have tried to blink the LS no trinket and died
[5:26:02] Juliio29: I feel that, I was just curious since they played sham a lot  and they got ran tf down in some matches, anyways I was screaming at my tv like the Super Bowl haha

[5:28:36] torzzttv: hold my beer
[5:28:37] theblacksheep231: reckful and sodah what a time
[5:29:26] torzzttv: I did enjoy the cata rivalry with Reckful and Samx
[5:29:42] Guelag: awc chat was megatoxic when they beat echo first time then went silent in finals
[5:29:54] runnnnnit: @cdewx mentioned how you congratulated them, then went to say eu doesnt do that and its toxic
[5:29:58] rembrandt89: @cdewx lontar made a joke that whaaz didnt play against you guys cause he didnt want trill to out damage him an lose viewers lol
[5:30:02] wardelswijk: i really dont understand the NA / EU hate. if you look the echo vs liquid series both teams played on the absolute best level. i have never seen a better series in Blizzcon / awc then this last final
[5:30:17] rainmannxz: !wa
[5:30:18] Moobot: @rainmannxz Healer WA's: https://wago.io/yW-d9CghV Enemy CD WA's: https://wago.io/pjH2s0KV3/13 SOTF WA: https://wago.io/L_Skl6u1K/1 Cursor WA: https://wago.io/Hklr0dCdf/1 Lifebloom WA: https://wago.io/i0UwagT-T/3 Rejuv WA: https://wago.io/pwPkkftuA/1

[5:30:57] BCboy_: thoughts on echo saying they would have demo arcane pala into hoolibang? you think thats the best counter?
[5:30:57] buffevoker: craiku
[5:31:03] rainmannxz: OMEGALUL
[5:31:12] slantsix: @martianpig tnx for sub
[5:31:18] swisha1123: @Juliio29 random hate is the fuel of the internet. It drives engagement
[5:31:21] Karaelolz: i'd be interested to see some ret DH pres pump
[5:31:22] D_Tram: Lontar is crazy tho Dewland.. was a good series
[5:31:38] Skillrogge: if the tables were reversed on the ms issue we wouln't hear the end of it
[5:31:39] rainmannxz: Lontar gives be Cdew vibes <3
[5:31:40] D_Tram: j/w what made you not go sham to at least 1 for 1 their sham??
[5:31:44] Degaussr: Lontar mentioned on his stream yesterday that he appreciated the message
[5:31:46] wardelswijk: demo omegalul
[5:32:14] DayDrinkin: @cdewx that 2v3 first series was the most insane game I have ever seen
[5:32:46] rembrandt89: kinda thought hoolibang would of used their dh more
[5:32:51] D_Tram: makes sense.. the trades arent exactly a PLUS.. just think you coulda outted Lontar w/ sham plays.. thx for answer <3
[5:33:09] Colaja953: FeelsOkayMan
[5:33:14] D_Tram: <3
[5:33:26] D_Tram: the purge on dragon is huge w/ outlaw
[5:33:27] shad3dspectr3: I would agree with that assessment
[5:33:28] D_Tram: tru tru
[5:33:29] Tjaktv: they were number 1 ladder on eu last ssn as ele dh with elswave ele
[5:33:35] ably: You dont think rogue/boomy does enough dmg on their own?
[5:33:38] D_Tram: the most random not lucky but lucky infernal
[5:33:39] marcdf111: if they didnt have pres in that 2v3 game idk if they wouldve won without the dps pressure
[5:33:51] D_Tram: that infernal was classic timing arena xD hahahahahaha
[5:34:22] runnnnnit: season 4 grand finals better be lan tho
[5:34:31] D_Tram: also losing 12k channel points means nothing.. the boiz are life, life is the boiz... LIQUID GAMING BB!!
[5:34:47] Rofyx: @runnnnnit they won't be and it has less reason for it to be lan since it's region specific
[5:35:20] runnnnnit: @Rofyx im talking grand finals not regionals
[5:36:33] Rofyx: what grand finals homie, the thing after cup 3 & 4 is gonna be the "grand finals" which is regional
[5:36:34] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:37:14] runnnnnit: @Rofyx it shouldnt be

[5:39:07] Rofyx: @runnnnnit well yes it would be much better to have more cross-region competitions at lan rather than having individual region finals but that won't change in season 4
[5:39:37] runnnnnit: @Rofyx season 4 is the big money tho
[5:39:52] ably: Were you implying that rogue/boomy doesnt have enough dmg without pres evoker - thats why you ran it instead of rsham? @cdewx
[5:40:14] itsallrngasf: Gz with second place in tournament! good job
[5:40:34] WutFace_VS_KrippO: i think issue is that dh has so much passive tankiness
[5:40:40] wardelswijk: if no one dies the DH / warlock auto win
[5:40:49] marcdf111: lock dh seems really tanky vs boomie rogue too
[5:42:19] Karaelolz: which comp do you think outdpses DH lock outside of mirror?
[5:42:21] ohsomagical_: does 2nd place still get money ?
[5:42:21] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:42:25] wardelswijk: eu comps so damp so boring...
[5:42:37] Charlemagne_66: a cleave of somesort
[5:42:38] ably: Is disc not a good pick with rogue/boomy if you need the extra dmg?
[5:42:39] Owlcopwn: dh lock pres
[5:42:52] Kyos_wow: @wardelswijk lontarXR
[5:43:02] ohsomagical_: does 2nd place still get money
[5:43:25] waffleberryx: r u running full mastery on TR? your verdants are friggin huuuuge
[5:43:29] piXxe: pres is hardest to play or
[5:43:36] Charlemagne_66: watching that 2v3 back i felt for lontar he was just completely oom watching his teamates get farmed
[5:43:46] Karaelolz: pres without innervate ooms so fast though I feel
[5:43:55] OnkelKokos: You should make a business meeting with world of warcraft. Ur making the game watchable, so u should have a piece of the cake. :)
[5:44:30] itsallrngasf: @cdewx when you life is streaming / gaming how many hours a day are you outside in the sunlight?
[5:44:37] Charlemagne_66: so when are u getting drunk
[5:44:37] Tepre: How would you like combat to change in war within
[5:45:25] Owlcopwn: huh?
[5:45:26] Charlemagne_66: it has too much cc
[5:45:30] Owlcopwn: he means combat like fighting
[5:45:36] Owlcopwn: wait is he talking about rogue
[5:45:41] Owlcopwn: I've confused myself
[5:45:42] flepardis: oldhead outlaw used to be called combat
[5:45:46] Tepre: I meant like wow overall not a single class.
[5:46:00] flepardis: i think he meant the actual pacing and pvp in general
[5:46:03] flepardis: not combat rogue lol
[5:46:12] Owlcopwn: nah he meant like combat, like fighting kEkW
[5:46:19] DontDv8: and if they arent everyone complains
[5:46:27] steve0hz: rogues are just a tool they dont even hit just CC to help a mage burst
[5:46:27] Charlemagne_66: too many stuns and cds allow them to always be good because of the 3 dps spec nature
[5:46:35] shamrager: shamrager subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months, currently on a 29 month streak! Insane tourney, you guys always give us viewers the best finals to watch during tourneys dewLove
[5:46:38] Valvax: ggs

[5:47:05] LuxtheGod: mes is still in austraila right
[5:47:15] OnkelKokos: You could ofc. But ur chair couldent :D
[5:47:21] shamrager: @cdewx curious why Sam didn‚Äôt play heart of the wild?
[5:47:35] Charlemagne_66: i think dh lock is just a better comp and to win u need to play insanely well as rog boomy
[5:47:35] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[5:47:39] Colaja953: Stare
[5:48:08] slantsix: big gate shorter cd is good
[5:48:43] Disdainlol: hunter is same as rogues tbh - too much cc for how much dmg
[5:48:57] Charlemagne_66: hunter is not the same as rogues
[5:49:36] Disdainlol: no they are two different classes :tf:
[5:49:38] Tepre: hunter is garbo right now
[5:50:03] slantsix: only way to kil boomys is to lock them out YEP
[5:50:41] ably: chat was calling boomy op for living as long sam did Stare
[5:50:55] Charlemagne_66: i think blizzard values being able to offheal too much on hybrids
[5:51:10] Zorthul_: boomy form gives armor too
[5:51:16] Valvax: they lock healers really good iff not kicked
[5:51:17] slantsix: cant use defensives
[5:51:19] ably: they were popular early season but i havent seen any around 2k mmr in weeks
[5:51:35] D_Tram: supa always high... i mean high... i mean... fukkk
[5:51:37] D_Tram: hes lit
[5:51:44] slantsix: the same 2-3 boomys
[5:51:45] D_Tram: damn it, hes musically inclines
[5:51:50] ably: did boomy change/get nerfed at all or people just started playing around it/other stuff got buffed?
[5:51:57] Ssds: just got r1 surv after not qing hunter arena for 2-3 months god bless

[5:53:15] Karaelolz: he has at least 2 accs I think
[5:53:16] ably: UHDK seems like it fell off too tbh
[5:53:42] Charlemagne_66: like i said i think blizzard over values the ability of hybrids being able to offheal so they make some of them squishy
[5:54:08] ably: free stats YEP
[5:54:21] flepardis: they also have a passive built into the racial with tattoos also 10% less magic damage
[5:54:23] atoker: under nether

[5:56:18] runnnnnit: @cdewx there needs to be a players union, where blizzard takes the opinions on the meta by proffesionals like yourself
[5:56:51] ably: Pandas LUL

[5:57:58] iLLwiLL_HS: everyones a D1 yapper including me
[5:58:31] ably: you'd take more dmg over more cc ?
[5:58:33] Charlemagne_66: micro cc is insane these days
[5:58:41] Trilltko: what about not being able to heal through damage from a rogue while not cc'd
[5:58:55] Trilltko: LOL
[5:58:58] Trilltko: my bad
[5:59:04] mortmos: @Charlemagne_66 Whats micro CC?
[5:59:05] BigFatAnimal: lol
