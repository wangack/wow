[0:33:17] skoll135: like an hour ago
[0:33:17] EfnetLemons: did u see the echo kill or were u sleeepingn
[0:33:22] Nevindaz: instead 1.79 of echo
[0:33:23] OhNoNotAgain: after, they had a 1.72 or something before
[0:33:30] Wulfknightz: 1.7% before echo won

[0:34:35] OldMan_Pappy: What was the difference in comp between them?
[0:34:41] Nevindaz: yea but they were just got started after the Method drama
[0:35:20] yadungoofed101: lol meeres moved scripe and roger to a diff channel while they were constant talking after a good pull and told the team they were pulling insta and moving lust to p3 then moved em back
[0:35:25] Dankmanarmy: Isnt max a co-owner now so would be harder to get them out no?
[0:35:43] Squintymonk31: LUL
[0:36:13] Zodiec: global release would prolly stop the eu salt I would guess
[0:36:51] Dankmanarmy: The complexity guys started tweeting about wanting to get into the race again
[0:37:22] yadungoofed101: stopping EU salt LuL
[0:37:41] Snabido: Thats a beastly server
[0:37:51] propwash80: @Towelliee so was this a sweep from Echo?
[0:37:53] monute316: put it all on the tourney realm just like everything else
[0:37:53] al_toids: Located in the middle of the ocean. LUL
[0:37:54] Flak19: greenland?
[0:37:59] Brodih_: an random island in the middle of the atlantic
[0:38:07] yadungoofed101: you shoulda seen the absolute garbage shit talking about liquid in max's chat and echo's chat after echo won; even though they won
[0:38:38] yadungoofed101: never ending EU salt is my point
[0:38:40] Snabido: @yadungoofed101 That's just toxic fanbase on both sides for ya
[0:38:51] Dankmanarmy: They cant have EU and NA share servers prob for laws related issues, the eu is fucking hard compared to NA
[0:38:55] mrwaddles22: just treat it like a ptr server. make one server for the world races and have all guilds competing copy their characters over
[0:38:56] Djfarmville: It always happens, pouring salt in the wounds
[0:39:00] Nevindaz: like in any fanbase sport
[0:39:06] Nevindaz: tribalism is high
[0:39:07] imperiosus: pretty sure its on both sides not just eu
[0:39:09] ultimaflarestar: @yadungoofed101 don't pretend the Liquid fans aren't just as toxic when they win
[0:40:23] monute316: rng blaze
[0:40:38] the_bad_goat: Echo also consistently had the cleanest P3 among the two
[0:40:38] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[0:40:41] CosmicBobRoss: Did you see the kill? It was actually insane. When Fyrakk died like half the raid died to a mechanic immediately after like it almost happened simultaneously lol just Fyrakk died a smidge first.
[0:40:53] Kerfuffles_: We have a shared birthday coming up. Do you want anything special this year?
[0:40:53] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:40:55] TweektheProphet: yeah liquid did a lot of play it out which is fine at the start to see stuff but at some point you have to know when to whip
[0:41:12] the_bad_goat: I literally watched some liquid people drop the seeds on top of the lines in multiple attempts
[0:41:18] Snabido: Mythic-only realm, global. Unlocks mythic difficulty on all realms when boss is dedge Keepo
[0:41:22] Aurelt6: I don't mind trash talking by both side fans. If it's SPORT - everything is allowed. Because in real sports trash talk is a must. other wise it loses entertainment value
[0:41:32] Hybro: or call it global server
[0:41:44] Fullmetal491: liquid also has about 100 more pulls than echo.
[0:42:02] Djfarmville: Or a gentlemen's agreement would be possible to start at the same time.
[0:42:26] GodTheMechanic: Liquid has more letters in their guild name, which has to be a clear advantage
[0:42:31] ultimaflarestar: Echo also take longer to talk things out before a pull most of the time
[0:42:36] monute316: liquid always pulls more echo likes to stop and talk it over alot
[0:42:40] kingdaddy96: Wait is it over?
[0:42:46] OldMan_Pappy: @the_bad_goat We can arm chair quarterback all day, until you're the one in those chairs doing the raid yourself, you just can't say you wouldn't make the same mistakes.
[0:43:05] Djfarmville: Yeah would never happen but would be possible, wouldnt req blizz to create a whole new server
[0:43:14] Daismoon: Blizzard is in NA and the release will always follow NA

[0:51:56] NoorMee: the questline is so long and expensive if it’s not 100% drop I’m gonna quit.
[0:52:07] Theduskflyer: we will get it when liquid kills in in a week. kappa
[0:52:07] smashwow: you have to have a region first

[0:52:41] neftario105: Yo what up
[0:52:58] the_general01: @Putcride we dont know yet
[0:53:23] Odinslayer: dude if it is RNG on top of RNG on top of winning it and then do these horrible quests and pay 1m gold to buy mats just for  8 ilvls and some 2min thing it aint worth lol

[1:02:36] Sollice: @TheGiant99 Yeah they will. The Blizzard cards are very very niche

[1:58:05] king_wrynn: @byrdeen45 My understanding is that once Mythic Fyrakk has been killed on Mythic in a given region, the Lego can then drop on any difficulty minus LFR.
[1:58:36] Mostdangspy: How long ago did Echo get the kill? I missed it
[1:59:04] Molvonos: @king_wrynn If its like the Evoker leggo, it will also drop in LFR, but at a much lower percentage

I don't won't to badmouth your Colts and the division but they for some reason they don't really put any opponent on high alert. Even in the sport media they are generally not so much talked about. CJ Stroud and Anthony Richardson are on their way to change that narrative though.
[3:46:21] Xara36: i dont see how you can put Richardson and Stroud in the same conversation

[3:49:34] cyberklinos: @Xara36 It's fair to say that they brought a new spotlight on the division. CJ Stroud is HIM and is running away with the OROY. Richardson showed promises but has to show more by playing more 100%.

[4:02:31] cyrex172: interesting....
[4:02:58] cyrex172: monopoly  ...lol...kinda like disney and microsoft
[4:04:03] kingdaddy96: What does Disney have a monopoly on?
[4:04:08] cyrex172: time to get my lock to 70
[4:04:48] dubvhero75: @kingdaddy96 he also has the worst team around him. he will be fine in a year or two.
[4:04:49] Moobot: THE new wireless Scimitar and Virtuoso Pro Open Back Headset now available! towLoot by CORSAIR! https://cor.sr/Towelliee
[4:06:11] kingdaddy96: @dubvhero75  fine sure, if he doesn't get seriously hurt. But he's not a top 10 QB. He's the type of QB that can get a team through if they have a defense

[4:10:19] FunkyThunderr: I mean if you buy War Within they give you Dragonflight
[4:10:30] kingdaddy96: Like how EA owns the rights to football. Sure Madden is repetitive trash and needs competition. They also own NHL rights. But 2k has NBA rights so they don't infringe on monopoly because there are other "options".
[4:10:31] cherrys_top: Character Transfer etc
