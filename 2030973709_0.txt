[1:02:44] ninousT: china decides
[1:02:44] jonisyntinen: we are underpopulated
[1:02:45] terlet_terwilliger: overpopulation is only a problem if liberal democracy is destroyed, and even then it's mostly just a problem for brown countries
[1:02:47] thebedshow: Overpopulation is a fucking meme. The earth could handle 10x it's current population without issue
[1:02:55] NutterCircus: People that talk about over population have never driven accross country.
[1:03:04] Synmachus: overpopulated is when big white family
[1:03:17] inchedup: I feel bad for people who've lived their entire life inside cities and have no idea how uncrowded the world is.
[1:03:17] ablib2: we don't have a overpopulation problem.  if a 1/3 of the world's pop wants to squeeze in places like INdia, that' their problem.
[1:03:18] NutterCircus: cities are overpopulated, thats all
[1:03:20] Mawshaw: If you actually care about "overpopulation" move to Canada, one of the lowest population density countries in the world
[1:03:28] PazokiTV: the world is no where near over population

[1:03:42] Ryun0911: lol i dunno overpopulated ??? you realize like 70 % of the land in this rock is unpopulated, not sure how we are in risk of suddenly having the world end due to overpopulation.
[1:03:43] rubbadubdubby: who cares what a twitch streamer's political opinions are
[1:03:44] NutterCircus: cities have always been overpopulated.
[1:03:44] mysteriousm4n: damn, china?
[1:03:46] 125christian125: You want reactionary change or responsible breeding/consumption?
[1:03:48] clozer_kek: over 100 distribution centers in the U.S. magically caught fire over the last couple years
[1:03:48] nehezbegar: West civilization is shrinking and will disappear eventually :), we are doomed and its point of no return unless WW3 happens and as always after war the birth rate is high :)
[1:04:05] yuckil: holy china gone
[1:04:16] Arcsilin: japans population is declining
[1:04:20] thebedshow: People who harp on about overpopulation are fundamentally anti human if you ever actually ask them to clarify their views. This is also true for almost all environmentalists. Their issue with the population is that it may somehow hurt other species, not humans. Fuck them. @StaysafeTV
[1:04:29] MundiPlays: Watch the studies of Hans Rosling, the fear of overpopulation is not reasonable
[1:04:32] clozer_kek: not a prob in North America by any means
[1:04:40] 1Horsepower: Someone in your family tree lived in the Carbiniferous period and literally had to fight a 16 foot tall centipede to survive, imagine complaining about your "finances", gtfo
[1:04:41] NutterCircus: Too many people, lets let poor people from 3rd world countries to fix over population EleGiggle
[1:04:50] Zargeras0: bro shes not half way across the world anymore? shes in Minnesota?
[1:04:57] yuckil: @1Horsepower BASED
[1:05:03] PazokiTV: if more people focused on themselves and their own household the world would be a better place
[1:05:07] nehezbegar: Ppl prefer to have cats than kids nowdays :).
[1:05:17] terlet_terwilliger: in Minnesota and marrying her brothers to bring them over to the US
[1:05:23] Depphallow: !server
[1:05:23] Ryun0911: japan is an island lol if the people there all died how world the world end as a result?  come on lol your arguement is invalid.  if you're saying we cannot feed them well, maybe they are responsible for feeding themselves like our ancestors were like staysafe is trying to point out
[1:05:23] Nightbot: NA-HORDE-CRUSADER STRIKE
[1:05:45] NutterCircus: I have talked to people that believe humans are the worlds problem so they are antihuman.
[1:05:47] berno100: me
[1:05:53] rubbadubdubby: only people that care about how many kids you have are republican boomers
[1:05:57] jagdtiger_00: @NutterCircus exactly you need to deport your ass
[1:05:59] Zargeras0: according to the UN currently were producing food for 11 billion people
[1:06:02] MundiPlays: scientists I guess
[1:06:04] sixpackchad: "overpopulation" meanwhile 99% of the earth is undeveloped
[1:06:05] 125christian125: @thebedshow or the fact that we are destroying the planet in the process of denying basic realities about human nature and consumption
[1:06:05] Snaketrap: monkaHmm all species have a carrying capacity. Deer have no predator
[1:06:13] 1Horsepower: 22,512,092,121 is the number cannot go 1 beyond that
[1:06:16] koldhanded: HUH
[1:06:17] unscconnor2: he is right. the same people that complain about overpopulation are the same people that complain about the climate and genuinely hate humanity
[1:06:18] Zeht: mrbeast on notice
[1:06:20] mysteriousm4n: monkaW
[1:06:27] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Why are the people who are worried about overpopulation only worried about reproduction in the west and not anywhere else? monkaHmm and why are they still okay having more immigration to the west... it doesn't add up
[1:06:28] inchedup: BASED
[1:06:32] terlet_terwilliger: the 500 million to 1 billion number that environmentalists put out is entirely based on their own aesthetic preferences
[1:06:40] rubbadubdubby: unless you're running for office, who cares
[1:06:42] ablib2: this sounds like a dumb issue.  Are people really concerned about overpopulation?
[1:06:45] weebpulper: LUL
[1:06:48] 125christian125: @ablib2 yes
[1:06:49] pharnzie: sup
[1:06:52] Arcsilin: more immigrant than babies born last yewar in NA
[1:06:54] NutterCircus: Actually, in an age of conflict, more children insure the bloodline, so have as many as humanly possible.
[1:06:55] Zargeras0: @Milanesa_De_Pollo lol true i guess
[1:06:55] inchedup: 2:3 atm for my wife and I.
[1:06:59] inchedup: might double it up eventually
[1:07:09] Zargeras0: @inchedup nice! gratz!
[1:07:11] 1Horsepower: duel
[1:07:18] ddepan: poverty contributes to overpopulation though, so taking money away would make the problem worse
[1:07:54] 125christian125: Im not suggesting any solution to overpopulation, simply saying that it exists and its a problem
[1:08:00] mysteriousm4n: yes
[1:08:04] Zargeras0: kill that NE rogue, he ganked me the other day on my alt
[1:08:07] madgarlicjr: dmf week?
[1:08:21] NutterCircus: WSG WEEKEND
[1:08:26] sixpackchad: @125christian125 "it exists and it's a problem" doesn't provide a single shred of evidence
[1:08:28] Zargeras0: avenge me Staysafe!"
[1:08:30] ShoogsHouse: whats the name of addon that shows timer on debuffs?
[1:08:34] SmokeBuddha: @125christian125 but it doesn't and it isn't. you're listening to the wrong people and seemingly incapable of discerning fact from fiction

[1:08:55] ShoogsHouse: hot dudes only ofc
[1:08:58] yung_lingling: 10 yrs from now.. what’s staysafe doing day to day?

[1:09:03] NutterCircus: Im getting on my mage to abuse alliance.
[1:09:13] Zargeras0: @yung_lingling raising kids obviously

[1:09:34] AntarcticTreaty: It will become a full on pr0n site by then Kappa
[1:09:35] Zargeras0: why wouldnt they be here?
[1:09:36] NutterCircus: Twitch is trying to figure out how to get streamers to work for free.
[1:09:40] CanadianRM4: maybe not since CEO says it's unprofitable now
[1:09:40] ablib2: it's kinda sad it's not profitable
[1:09:43] SepeIio: We'll be watching you on twitter streaming Pog
[1:09:45] SmokeBuddha: @SpaceGhost8 youtube really isn't even trying to compete honestly
[1:09:46] unscconnor2: didnt the ceo just come out and say amazon is basically carrying them right now
[1:09:47] kaiju_kin: @125christian125 neither of those things support your point
[1:09:47] palac105: it just takes 1 of your autist children to become the next Ford and lead another industrial revolution that will complete negate the environment concerns @StaysafeTV
[1:09:48] andyjamesgames: NOPER

[1:09:55] Snaketrap: YEP 0% interest rate era
[1:09:57] clozer_kek: No. Rumble/Odysee -- or whatever replaces them
[1:09:59] caltex88: We will all be playing a 29 year old game in 10 years lol
[1:10:02] yung_lingling: will WoW be more or less prevalent in 10 years..?
[1:10:10] pottatowtv: Companies will only sink money for so long
[1:10:12] ATcaribou: that seems crazy.
[1:10:12] 125christian125: @LJM_GG I guess you're lost
[1:10:14] speedzombie: i dont understand how its not profitable. so costly to host streams?
[1:10:20] puddug: good evening gamers
[1:10:21] tendollafatha: amazon is an expert at losing money while growing in value
[1:10:22] andyjamesgames: <5 years we will all be streaming on Kick.
[1:10:26] AtomicSmoke7: are they "losing" money because they are paying themselves more then then have to for server fees?
[1:10:29] palac105: these types of platforms are surveillance tools not money making ops
[1:10:32] SpaceGhost8: the infrastructure to run streaming is very expensive
[1:10:44] kaiju_kin: @125christian125 no, you aren't using arguments that are logical
[1:10:45] tofivetofive: If Democrats stay in office the next  10 years, you won't have to worry about Twitch.
[1:10:49] inchedup: Are they losing money or investing in forming ideologies?
[1:10:53] NutterCircus: data rates are stupid expensive.
[1:10:54] clozer_kek: @tendollafatha Prob fake #'s, & everyone hates Bezos.

[1:11:42] clozer_kek: @StaysafeTV I think blockchain based streaming is the next wave tbh
[1:11:47] vazj: Is it fair to think Twitch as a platform will sustain just like YouTube when the user base has an opportunity for financial growth?
[1:11:50] Phalloides60: Phalloides60 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months!

[1:12:34] TrooperHuge: heya
[1:12:35] 1Horsepower: @vazj youtube is just barely profitable with much more powerful ad network and more tricks to use with caching and CDN
[1:12:36] andyjamesgames: BIden is doing all those things! How crazy
[1:12:44] Leviosor: @only499atkfc dude i forgot ab that
[1:12:44] Mipolarization: You can't make it up. KEKW
[1:12:45] terlet_terwilliger: Remember when Trump's administration got rid of Net Neutrality and the internet died forever, such a shame Sadge

[1:13:32] Leviosor: @tofivetofive whatttt
[1:13:37] NutterCircus: Just before the pandemic I was getting job offers out of nowhere.
[1:13:37] Doribob1: did you see what texas did?
[1:13:42] AtomicSmoke7: Did Trump not pressure the Ukrainians to announce a public investigation into the bidens?
[1:13:42] de1andel: Trump’s opinion on the war in Ukraine just screams, let’s ignore our biggest enemy and let the authoritarian regimes accumulate power and human power
[1:13:50] re5onxnce: makes me sick to the core
[1:13:54] clozer_kek: we're doomed

[1:14:33] andyjamesgames: you guys are mad about all the illegals, but i'm glad theyre here. when ww3 pops off, all these illegels can prove their loyalty to this country by digging trenches in the front lines. it's going to be glorious.
[1:14:36] Yarith: @de1andel ukraine isnt our land isnt our problem and they funnel most of our tax dollars into corruption not real defense

[2:04:36] only499atkfc: It wasn't just the US Government, it was a worldwide thing. We were all unaware of the potential damage
[2:04:36] clozer_kek: Save it for later
[2:04:38] Torrniquet: Not if they thought it was bullshit because of misinformation, which could contribute to at least thousands if not hundreds of thousands of more contagious infections passed between them and others, which would spread it even more and cause all those deaths
[2:04:40] brettanoia: They have to make commercials with Travis Kelce to promote people getting it...we all know it's BS.
[2:04:44] therealrickdiculous: @Pharaohq youre still here?
[2:04:47] TheDastardlyD: 0.5% efficacy rate btw
[2:04:49] Humansoup: TRUE AND TRUE
[2:04:53] clozer_kek: put the to dee[ shiit on RUMBLE
[2:04:53] Lionkingler1: YEP funded to push their products
[2:04:59] imradioaktive: can't wait for disease X
[2:05:07] only499atkfc: the entire planet was financially motivated?
[2:05:10] ez_readd: As well as suppress any criticism against it and other potential treatments
[2:05:16] Polerize: one of the largest transfers of wealth in world history
[2:05:19] andyjamesgames: @Pharaohq maybe you'll come back to this world in the form of a Glorious Eagle ! Soaring above the clouds, and all this bullshit this earth has to offer
[2:05:22] jrandolph21: Ive never gotten covid and never got the vaccine so i see now reasone for it
[2:05:35] katarn231: @only499atkfc welcome to globalism
[2:05:46] normageqq: the problem is the perception of the significance  of the percentage of deaths and after affects, you either think it's a concern or you dont, but there is a state health concern at a specific point
[2:05:47] therealrickdiculous: agreed
[2:05:47] Xammy0: I LOVE VACCINES BatChest
[2:05:47] Torrniquet: There becomes a numerical point where the authoritarian part has to be factored in for the sake of humanity lol. If your numerical point is 100% death rate and 100% infection rate that's nuts
[2:05:50] orangemaple24: why do you only bring up covid vax but not other vax that help
[2:05:54] Zaziben: do you not know what warp speed means? It means really fast bro, like, c'mon
[2:05:54] Lionkingler1: OMEGALUL sleepy joe
[2:05:55] andyjamesgames: @therealrickdiculous he's only said "goodbye" 50 times. he has to get to 100 times until he's gone for real.
[2:06:00] clozer_kek: This might be the only interesting channel I've seen in a long time.
[2:06:04] Pharaohq: @andyjamesgames  if i do kill myself I hope I dont come  back to this universe dude
[2:06:04] madabber_: @andyjamesgames always go for the proof xD
[2:06:04] MysticalOS: he's lucky he can remember his own name
[2:06:05] only499atkfc: @katarn231 it was so nice for all of the world leaders to put their differences aside, just to push a vaccine. :) lucky us!
[2:06:07] clozer_kek: on tweetch
[2:06:10] OspreyRed: @orangemaple24 because they are irrelevant
[2:06:11] kaintk: i had covid twice and it was the worst weeks of my life ever, you are lucky guys, if you never had it
[2:06:13] TheDastardlyD: because the covid vax has a 0.5% efficacy rate
[2:06:19] topalphadog1: Sleepy Joe
[2:06:19] balkanstrike: its an inoculation ...
[2:06:22] therealrickdiculous: yeah there were several big Ls
[2:06:24] Pharaohq: its pretty good idea at this time there is no escape
[2:06:26] Synmachus: Was vaccinated. Got covid anyway
[2:06:27] terlet_terwilliger: Anthony Fauci was super suspect for the duration of the coof too
[2:06:27] balkanstrike: apparently
[2:06:29] AceOfFlame: I got the vaccine and never got covid
[2:06:33] orangemaple24: @OspreyRed how so
[2:06:36] draqcula: I am not antivaccine but the truth is it became a huge money grab its not efficient that much
[2:06:37] baroo6911: Man this stream is just so depressing and full negativity
[2:06:40] goodstuffg: @kaintk LULW
[2:06:40] tomelele: do you think joe biden hits da griddy
[2:06:45] therealrickdiculous: or when they told ppl masks wouldnt help and then said they would... cmon experts
[2:06:49] OspreyRed: @orangemaple24 how and why would they matter to this one?
[2:06:56] its_Blocky: how far from exalted are you>?
[2:06:56] Xammy0: Commonwealth countries are such bootlickers it's insane
[2:06:59] fakenewsnoshoes: yeah but Hunter Biden has an 8 inch penis apparently
[2:06:59] NoeyBosa: @kaintk i had covid before, from a party full of vaccincated people, I have no vaccine, here I am thriving
[2:07:04] kaintk: @goodstuffg i hope you will have it, you will lose your laugh LUL
[2:07:08] AceOfFlame: America did have an oddly weird number of covid compare to rest of the world
[2:07:08] ez_readd: Big pharma plug coming straight from our president
[2:07:11] its_Blocky: oh i see, nvm
[2:07:15] andyjamesgames: @kaintk yikes
[2:07:24] clozer_kek: spread them out, all good. non mrna
[2:07:31] topalphadog1: Pepega
[2:07:31] revora_: Most vaccine's are good. Covid vaccine was a bit of a scam
[2:07:31] Lionkingler1: BASED
[2:07:52] SpoolyZ02: I got the first vax and my face broke out like crazy for a year and a half
[2:07:59] Buttsworth: i got the covid vaccine i ended up getting covid twice
[2:08:00] Torrniquet: OK what about for the flu
[2:08:00] draqcula: there is actual science proving that spike proteins are causing problems and people have post-vaccine immune issues event thought its more rare
[2:08:02] only499atkfc: To be honest, a lot of anti vaxx people ARE like that though. They get their medical advice off Tiktok
[2:08:04] burritofritter: 2019 was 5 years ago Aware
[2:08:07] orangemaple24: @OspreyRed I thought he was saying all were bad as blanket stamtent but he clarified
[2:08:11] tomelele: i got the vaccine and ended up playing a rogue
[2:08:12] L0pedogg: The propaganda has got better
[2:08:21] its_Blocky: you gonna grind exalted hard or just casually do it over the next few weeks/month or two?
[2:08:24] OspreyRed: @orangemaple24 okay
[2:08:25] draqcula: even*
[2:08:28] ez_readd: But don't tell them what to do with their bodies
[2:08:31] re5onxnce: odd it pops up right before elections
[2:08:32] troutmaster23: MY man can really articulate a point.
[2:08:34] Dvdbf: what you don't trust a rushed vaccine with still alot of questions about it c'mon man
[2:08:37] clozer_kek: Abummer revoked the Smith-Mundt ACT = propaganda
[2:08:43] Buttsworth: @tomelele thats pretty bad man
[2:08:44] L0pedogg: as in it is more effective and harder to pin point
[2:08:44] NoeyBosa: Yet to meet a person who didnt fold the the covid vaccine pressure wish they got the shot, met many who wish they didnt get it
[2:08:53] harvenius: The next pandemic will absolutely not have the same societal response. I live in New Zealand and we were probably the goodest boys in the world, but next time that won't be the case imo.
[2:08:58] DaGreenGiant: Am I allowed to watch yet?
[2:08:59] eraser9: imagine if the exalted bracers are not bis in phase 2 hehehe
[2:09:03] SpoolyZ02: Just wait for the next time we "need" a vax its gonna be a shit show
[2:09:16] stunn4: i still dont understand how no one went to jail after the whole covid faxine sjit came out and everyone regulation/politicon knew about the bullshit
[2:09:22] draqcula: @harvenius you guys did the right thing though you were in open stadiums without masks while the rest of the world was still isolating
[2:09:26] tomelele: @harvenius i live in NZ and no one will do shit bro KEKW
[2:09:35] andyjamesgames: @harvenius New Zealand went kind of nutty with their covid response tho
[2:09:39] terlet_terwilliger: @harvenius horse face really gave you guys the run through
[2:09:49] Rootwell_: hello gangstars
[2:09:56] DaGreenGiant: I got mine. But do whatever makes you happy.
[2:09:56] kaintk: nothing will change, people dont like to revolt :P
[2:09:59] Polerize: what can i do, if i dont take the shit i get fired
[2:10:00] only499atkfc: @andyjamesgames so the NZ government is corrupt?
[2:10:04] OspreyRed: people will do the same
[2:10:05] fakenewsnoshoes: any pandemic with only a 0.1% death rate isnt going to be taken serious anymore
[2:10:11] Rootwell_: hang the politicians
[2:10:12] uptogg: tbh its kind of the first modern "plague scare", huge overreaction from most of the world
[2:10:15] tomelele: same thing
[2:10:24] BinksMagnus: what if the next one has a 10% mortality rate and kills someone other than fat old people
[2:10:24] burritofritter: stay inside play wow
[2:10:26] nutwerthmaximus: "here we go again" mentality
[2:10:27] user08cc21c8: i think if it were to happen again they wouldnt mandate vaccines i think
[2:10:37] tomelele: lockdown in NZ was sick, i played wow all day and got my degree XD
[2:10:41] L0pedogg: @Rootwell_ Viva la Revolucion
[2:10:42] tripledistance: interest rates and cost of living through the roof?
[2:10:42] Buttsworth: are we getting into conspiracies?
[2:10:44] ez_readd: I literally got charged $70 a month for not having the vaccine. The same ones that have been pulled now for heart issues
[2:10:55] yopiz_tv: but..but sir...polio
[2:11:00] Lionkingler1: YEP no need to force people
[2:11:02] selmoTV: noone will get vaxx'ed again, alot of ppl having heart issues now
[2:11:03] abruptdecayO_O: the small businesses dying was enough for me to say not again
[2:11:06] Buttsworth: do you think the spread of covid was intentional?
[2:11:06] abruptdecayO_O: the shut downs were so bad
[2:11:07] l4rryf1sh: inflation been fucked ever since
[2:11:13] m3xbean: We are groomed to consume and buy what is infront of us...so...if it is in our face, people will fold
[2:11:13] BinksMagnus: @atp1916a spanish flu had about those rates
[2:11:16] selmoTV: gm btw
[2:11:23] DaGreenGiant: I got mine because I believed in it, and then my daughter was born respiratory unwell, so it was worth even more.
[2:11:27] tomelele: i feel bad for the small business in lockdown ngl Sadge
[2:11:34] Torrniquet: So many people believe wildly untrue or anti-scientific things about COVID that don't even involve the vaccine itself that that's kind of crazy to assume
[2:11:34] Dvdbf: they lie we die
[2:11:35] OspreyRed: i think people largely will do what ever is easiest
[2:11:38] tussmack: darwin would take care of those who wouldnt
[2:11:45] ez_readd: Look at the increase of heart attacks since the vaccine
[2:11:47] clozer_kek: why do children need a chicken pow vax? dumb
[2:11:50] L0pedogg: What if there was a vaccine that made you luckier? ho would take that?
[2:11:52] only499atkfc: That's the thing though Staysafe, no one was actually 100% sure of how dangerous it was when Covid first came around
[2:11:52] selmoTV: im not vaxx'ed and i was fine
[2:11:59] vitaherbb: covid was bioengineered to steal an election, no way i'd get their comission bonus vaccine as well
[2:12:02] rocknsake: yeah covid wasn't deadly enough to scare anybody
[2:12:18] andyjamesgames: and the main stream media did their damndest to dig up those stories didnt they
[2:12:18] BinksMagnus: @atp1916a and?
[2:12:21] draqcula: @ez_readd I would argue that the virus itself is a cardiovascular one so it go both ways
[2:12:22] yopiz_tv: BASED
[2:12:23] only499atkfc: We all thought "it was severe enough" when 2020 hit
[2:12:26] NoeyBosa: So they create a disease scary enough, great...
[2:12:26] rocknsake: if people were dropping dead in public and corpses being piled on the side of the road for pickup, everyone would get the vax
[2:12:27] 125christian125: it was a bioweapon
[2:12:28] fakenewsnoshoes: i had covid and all it did was make me cough alot for 2 days
[2:12:28] jonisyntinen: IF SOMETHING WORKS IT SELLS ITSELF! @staysafetv
[2:12:32] stunn4: werent we told that everyday healthy people die of covid?
[2:12:33] flyghtorfyght: is anyone playing era still or all sod
[2:12:37] Buttsworth: @vitaherbb china was in cahoots with the US?
[2:12:41] DaGreenGiant: I mean polio and mumps are gone pretty much in first world for a reason
[2:12:50] nutwerthmaximus: they took our jerbs
[2:12:50] ez_readd: It made sense for older and obese people but once they started pushing it on kids you knew it wasn't genuine
[2:12:51] terlet_terwilliger: @only499atkfc they knew if had a 99% survival rate at least by March or April of 2020
[2:12:51] orangemaple24: kinda sucks most young people were forced to get it
[2:12:54] Bandito_BDO: Yeah except i saw no one literally no one get covid ahah and no one die..
[2:12:58] OspreyRed: @DaGreenGiant people started to wash their hands
[2:13:00] m3xbean: i think if people die to covid then maybe they shouldnt repopulate, natural selection is the best vax
[2:13:03] L0pedogg: The Narrative around COVID was dishonest
[2:13:06] only499atkfc: @terlet_terwilliger show me the cited sources that prove that
[2:13:07] vitaherbb: @Buttsworth china has biden under their fingertips yes
[2:13:08] harvenius: My issue with New Zealand, is that we went super strict with our response, felt like the end of times, and the aftermath was it just kind of "ended" and now no one talks about it. Talk about a fucking headspin. The next pandemic will roll in and there will just be mass doubt
[2:13:09] 125christian125: @orangemaple24 nah, they just bent under the pressure. Spineless
[2:13:15] Ghoulls_: you planning on doin wsg all stream?
[2:13:16] Sal_con: @StaysafeTV  are u a doomer
[2:13:16] BinksMagnus: @atp1916a HUH
[2:13:18] Buttsworth: @vitaherbb that is wild
[2:13:24] Mister_Chamfer: @m3xbean what a twat
[2:13:40] orangemaple24: @125christian125 atleast for me I would of lost my job =/
[2:13:41] Xammy0: @harvenius in Canada they are still wearing masks and living in fear
[2:13:52] vitaherbb: @Buttsworth you must have ignored hunters laptop entirely libtard
[2:13:52] andyjamesgames: and it was scenes from a movie, right?
[2:13:56] DaGreenGiant: @ospreyred do people wash their hands? Or just rinse with water
[2:13:56] l4rryf1sh: POG
[2:13:57] j_quest: No vaccine can ever stop the virus from invading your body, no vaccine can be 100% leak proof...the next pandemic that is a fraction more deadly still will have people pushing back
[2:14:00] selmoTV: @Bandito_BDO i got covid and less symptoms then a severe flue
[2:14:03] kaintk: @Xammy0 lol no i live in canada and nobody wear a mask
[2:14:09] NutterCircus: The Wiggle...
[2:14:10] nutwerthmaximus: your premade just got rolled over lol

[2:14:18] l4rryf1sh: exactly
[2:14:19] clozer_kek: don't be the butt of the joke
[2:14:20] tussmack: the bolting of doors was insane, i wonder how real that was
[2:14:27] 125christian125: @orangemaple24 testicular fortitude issue
[2:14:29] Maehdras18: tbf, covid was the best thing to happen to my life. got a fulfilling job that doubled my income and met the woman I'm going to marry and divorced my bitch ex wife
[2:14:32] harvenius: @Xammy0 oh wow, we've mostly finished with mask use for the most part. Very rarely do people even speak of covid lol
[2:14:34] DaGreenGiant: @xammy0 im canadian too. AB
[2:14:38] only499atkfc: is there anything wrong with them admitting that?
[2:14:38] ez_readd: Imagine Kamala Harris telling you to take a vaccine for the new disease unleased on us again
[2:14:44] TheDastardlyD: I still have vids of people welding doors shut
[2:14:45] harvenius: I haven't even had covid
[2:14:46] selmoTV: @j_quest rdna vaxx is kinda experimental and fck up
[2:14:55] draqcula: Bottom line even if you don't want the jab don't get infected 100 times per year it is never good to be sick all the time
[2:14:58] kaintk: @Xammy0 quebec, ok i say it differently,in the east we dont wear mask, i dont know for the west
[2:15:00] Xammy0: im from BC and most of my family is still masking up on airplanes or at concerts etc
[2:15:02] draqcula: should be a common ground
[2:15:14] imradioaktive: my man
[2:15:15] its_Blocky: covid ruined mine :)
[2:15:15] j_quest: @selmoTV whats rDNA
[2:15:18] tozzi6: do you think these young athletes having heart problems had something to do with the vaccine?
[2:15:21] Buttsworth: any covid enjoyers/
[2:15:22] m3xbean: @Mister_Chamfer naw, why should weak humans survive? legit. it does nothing good. they cost and consume and double cost of everything
[2:15:28] BLUNDERGUN: my bitch wife KKona
[2:15:36] Bare02: no lol
[2:15:37] selmoTV: @j_quest google
[2:15:37] unscconnor2: i mean its just how it is, we were right to take it serious in the beginning. but once data came out it was nothing, lockdowns etc shouldve stopped
[2:15:38] vitaherbb: cdc.gov literally says it causes myocarditis now
[2:15:39] Ghoulls_: ya it was strange they werent willing to admit it wasnt as deadly as they expected
[2:15:45] mariosp90: they were having them before
[2:15:46] DaGreenGiant: Im Alberta, i havent seen a mask in quite some time
[2:15:50] Buttsworth: remember ebola chan?
[2:15:51] re5onxnce: maybe their parents are over working them
[2:15:51] Pharaohq: lol Dr.StaySafeon vaccine Efficay okay   https://clips.twitch.tv/ThankfulPreciousCrabsSSSsss-S0S6w3aWKNgCqusd
[2:15:57] nutwerthmaximus: cardiac arrest, not a heart attack. very very different
[2:16:02] j_quest: @selmoTV do you mean mRNA
[2:16:02] imradioaktive: it's all funny bro
[2:16:03] selmoTV: spiked after covid tho
[2:16:07] 125christian125: @m3xbean Unless the virus specifically target certain genetic makeups that arent necessarilly less fit
[2:16:08] andyjamesgames: @unscconnor2 but the money the politicians were making was too good! they couldnt just let it end!
[2:16:12] The_Farting_Spaniard: lul
[2:16:12] nutwerthmaximus: cardiac arrest your heart completely stops, heart attack it over works itself
[2:16:16] goodstuffg: based
[2:16:18] fakenewsnoshoes: THATS HILARIOUS
[2:16:22] goodstuffg: based EZ
[2:16:25] imradioaktive: KEKW
[2:16:30] andyjamesgames: LUL
[2:16:38] treeyuu: thats hilarious
[2:16:40] l4rryf1sh: uh mazin
[2:16:47] nagolith: Covid killed my best friend so and he had no health problems before. So Covid was rough for my wife and I
[2:16:48] Buttsworth: i still can't smell
[2:16:52] clozer_kek: myocarditis up on a logarithmic scale
[2:17:02] draqcula: the virus itself is a vascular one so you can get problems from the vaccine AND the virus
[2:17:03] Bandito_BDO: I got sooooo fkn sick after my 1st jab... that night i broke out in hives that bled..
[2:17:06] draqcula: but not everyone has the same risks
[2:17:08] ez_readd: You see the new ammunition tax they are doing @staysafetv t
[2:17:08] Xammy0: There are excess deaths all around the world the last 2 years, unaccounted for
[2:17:14] terlet_terwilliger: @only499atkfc search the Lancet for "the many estimates of Covid-19 case fatality rate"
[2:17:15] only499atkfc: @nagolith sorry for your loss :(
[2:17:16] NutterCircus: All I remember was the dancing Tiktok Nurses.
[2:17:19] harvenius: @nagolith myocarditis?
[2:17:27] clozer_kek: means ur not a sheep
[2:17:28] selmoTV: @j_quest ya prolly im not sure about the correct silabals, also english my 2nd
[2:17:29] m3xbean: @125christian125 ok well same rules applies
[2:17:40] unscconnor2: i will say, that one guy that commented on athletes dropping is happening more often. lot of healthy young athletes dropping all of a sudden
[2:17:41] 125christian125: @m3xbean no. It doesnt
[2:17:42] selmoTV: flue vanish
[2:17:46] selmoTV: lmao
[2:17:48] vitaherbb: covid is fake created to steal an election
[2:17:52] imradioaktive: I think they got fed money if it was covid, so they all said it was covid
[2:17:55] quibl0: I mean thank you for being based regardless
[2:18:08] only499atkfc: @terlet_terwilliger quote it, show me where it says they knew it had a 99% survival rate
[2:18:10] Torrniquet: It's not that it was entirely possible. That was the only explanation of that kind of drop off
[2:18:15] m3xbean: @125christian125 what genetics do you think its targeting? old age? lmao
[2:18:15] Mendo_28: then why would covid be spreading
[2:18:16] only499atkfc: @terlet_terwilliger in 202
[2:18:18] GeneralBurns1: covid was a control thing used by the government
[2:18:19] selmoTV: lmao and it vanish to 0 cases
[2:18:22] clozer_kek: flu cases were the same
[2:18:22] stailord: covid was way stronger then regular flu and super easy to catch it
[2:18:24] Torrniquet: It's pretty inarguable
[2:18:29] selmoTV: no fking way
[2:18:29] clozer_kek: they called it something diff
[2:18:30] terlet_terwilliger: @only499atkfc just read it, it says it, it's not long
[2:18:31] draqcula: covid is way more easy to get than the flu too
[2:18:34] gressil1234: i didn't get a vax because i just didn't care
[2:18:36] Mendo_28: i mean its a proven fact but ok lmao
[2:18:37] draqcula: it is supper efficient to spread in its nature
[2:18:43] j_quest: @StaysafeTV the take on that is called competitive exclusion as well..covid was that good at dominating the virus world
[2:18:48] 125christian125: @m3xbean White people. Obvious bio-weapon if you look at the countries were most people died (that also vaccinated the most people)
[2:18:50] only499atkfc: @terlet_terwilliger not gonna do your hw for you
[2:19:00] TheDastardlyD: spread more kill less
[2:19:03] selmoTV: true
[2:19:10] draqcula: exactly !
[2:19:12] clozer_kek: truth
[2:19:17] Bandito_BDO: Or that they got covid it was so piss weak they thout it was the flu and now have natural immunity : )

[2:36:37] Prevention6: im gonna stick my fingers up my bum and then smell them
[2:36:39] theDill: A man who once went 382 days fasting between 1965 and 1966, saw an extraordinary change to his body.

[2:38:02] 125christian125: @m3xbean So you imply that any selection that occurs by intelligence isnt natural.
[2:38:04] jellyfishi1337: we are only adopting these atoms bro

[2:39:07] harvenius: there's vegan b12
[2:39:08] yuckil: how many vegan people have died recently
[2:39:08] Varels1: I was turbo vegan for 7½ years. stopped 1½ years ago
[2:39:10] terlet_terwilliger: if you don't have an instagram to post to they 100% would start eating their dogs
[2:39:15] zakkoncrak: do deer need b12?
[2:39:16] m3xbean: @125christian125 its natural, in a sense its in the cosmos, but artificially selected through manipulation by life itself.
[2:39:17] Varels1: my body was craving meat
[2:39:19] varamithis: are the supplements vegan?
[2:39:21] zakkoncrak: or herbivores?
[2:39:27] selmoTV: @shrektard69 in the show the vegan girl actually did 2 chalenges
[2:39:27] BinksMagnus: there are vegan b12 supplements, but no natural sources that are vegan
[2:39:28] Arcsilin: vegans are the most unbased
[2:39:35] balkanstrike: its not a bad thing
[2:39:44] Xammy0: probably because she wasn't eating a bunch of trash anymore
[2:39:44] zakkoncrak: do herbivores need B12 how does that work?
[2:39:47] 125christian125: @m3xbean What constitutes artificial vs real
[2:39:47] executedpoorly: Placebo effect is so strong with people
[2:39:56] m3xbean: @125christian125 its all real
[2:40:08] nocontrast: does warsong revered/exalted reward anything this phase?
[2:40:16] shrektard69: what were u doing in asian farms at 19
[2:40:18] dirbagdan: b12 is actually produced by bacteria, but more bioavailable in animals than plants.
[2:40:21] Dvdbf: I was vegan for 3 days during a snowstorm
[2:40:24] 125christian125: @m3xbean So I guess then, what constitutes artificial vs natural
[2:40:30] terlet_terwilliger: @zakkoncrak they still eat meat and bugs, but they also have guts that ferment their food long enough to digest the bacteria that make b12
[2:40:32] ViciousRI: vegan can't eat eggs right?
[2:40:40] savagelo256: wtf did you say you use to work on Chinese farms haha or am I high

[2:41:50] dirbagdan: we need meat. its essential
[2:42:00] m3xbean: @125christian125 i guess the pure manipulation of its time, or genetics, other than "its" natural process on which the genetics takes place

[2:43:00] Varels1: @theDill true

[2:43:14] BinksMagnus: and also probably on steroids

[2:43:37] kaintk: @theDill its because vegans are crazy people who attack you for eating meat lol
[2:43:39] Varels1: vegan 7½ years & eating meat again for 1½ years. skipping diary is amazing, just veggies & meat
[2:43:45] m3xbean: @125christian125 Does evolution have to occur biologically?
