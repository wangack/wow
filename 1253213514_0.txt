[5:00:00] wheresjada: it just requires your raid to have competant players, and you use some consumes its ez
[5:00:11] 7222storm: lol this is not hard even for the average 13 year old gamer im sorry
[5:00:13] gaypen97: its gear and consume based, classic dosent have that many mechanics. If ppl go OOM ur doomed
[5:00:13] LordBrotherChad: wasn't sovereign a guild on Faerlina
[5:00:15] the_bronze_yasuo: thats why sovereign needs to make a joint raid with other guilds
[5:00:32] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Believe in the Unknown by Afilion -> https://prtzl.io/3nHAAdnj2VMVWVIZ

[5:03:26] wheresjada: also the strat most guilds do is kill Luci first btw. getting rid of her fast is easier on healers and dispellers
[5:03:28] xplicit_tm: @gaypen97 i agree 100%...the time/gold spent is crazy..then chance for gear...just not enough for MC

[5:04:02] jeanlucjaf: Restorative potions would save ur raid
[5:04:04] lunatik710: this looks painful to the max
[5:04:09] dumb_death: is your server actually dead?
[5:04:17] melftothemoon: hes playing elem with 2H but trying to heal xD a litlle bit lost
[5:04:17] Zalva85: dmg income insane
[5:04:18] stoutart: it was like this 17 years ago. After a week trying to get the first boss you learn to focus.
[5:04:28] gaypen97: @Exnihilo77 honestly its not that hard, we do full clear in 2hrs. Its just more gear based than before, everyone need to use consumes
[5:04:36] avenomxx: just send everyone home to study the mechanic and meet again next week
[5:04:46] Zalva85: how many healers?
[5:04:53] Tabarnark: 5 hour on lucifron sad
[5:04:55] Zalva85: heavy dmg income
[5:05:05] LordBrotherChad: why is she asking you to decurse
[5:05:06] rapidanwow: which raid? and congrats on 12
[5:05:18] melftothemoon: stop try dps melee xD just purge and heal
[5:05:20] gaypen97: ur right, its just about decursing and tanking
[5:05:35] xplicit_tm: @Chosey i can get every slot filled with pvp gear and pvp rep vendor gear
[5:05:40] PaPaHutcH: lol
[5:05:48] lunatik710: yeah how many healers do you guys have? seem to be lacking heals
[5:05:51] gaypen97: mages should be on the bottom of the DPS meter here, they should only focus on decursing
[5:05:52] Gorillagrip: I joined Sovereign on TBC launch and I had to leave after a few days
[5:05:56] ezy993: Its also the impending doom which is a magic effect which does around 1.2k damage after 12 secs @Swifty

[6:19:35] TouSmoove: You PvPing swifty?
[6:19:37] newkingcody: “Merging” servers is actually something that WoW has almost never done, and the reason for this is simple; we don’t like the idea of someone losing their unique name on a realm, and this is doubly true for classic where your identity in the community is a major aspect of the game.
[6:20:01] Zalva85: @Macka39 wipes on lucifron

[10:23:32] Vertun92: go swifty go
[10:23:41] hoodbubble: nah wow is meant to be cartoonist
[10:23:47] StreamElements: Type !points to see how many points you have!
[10:23:52] DerLadebalken: Wouln't play WoW with unreal graphics, i think the cartoonish style is what makes it have his own characteristics
[10:24:13] Dabigin: I still say a modern Star Wars Galaxies would tear me away from wow. I miss the crazy battles in that game :(
[10:24:28] Nihum: i need to see a toon in unreal engine...environment all nice but i need to see an orc warrior
[10:24:32] miroslavisikiyski: looks like a mobile game
[10:24:32] grillchips231: Why would you wanna ruin the game with a whole new graphic?
[10:24:47] DanielWC: a full scale real life sized planet wow is what Id like
[10:24:52] grillchips231: LIke the graphic we have now is a part of it
[10:25:03] belfastcl: I think they won't do something like that soon mostly because a big chunk of the population wouldn't be able to run the game
[10:25:05] exig0: i wanna have WoW Movie with the Cinematic Graphics, that would be awesome
[10:25:23] grillchips231: Cause it would not be Wow anymore
[10:25:23] OtherguyTTV: @swifty Hey sie
[10:25:24] hoodbubble: have u played dark souls
[10:25:29] belfastcl: wow can run on a toaster, that partly explains why so many people play it
[10:25:30] Bearman217: I hear ya bud. but imagine the bandwidth and graphics card you would need to run this smooth.
[10:25:30] crackadangdang: Is rank 14 the best gear in game
[10:25:33] Fudge2: graphics not important, gameplay and systems make good games.
[10:25:35] TheBeastIncarnateF5Reigns: @Swifty are u in arenas in retail RN ?
[10:25:39] crackadangdang: Someone explain to me what higher ranking gets you
[10:25:43] OtherguyTTV: Hi Sir. why are you droppin queue so often?
[10:25:56] Dabigin: I think part of it would be making sure wow would work on multiple systems, It is a lot different when you have pc running it, as opposed to consoles that run the same hardware.
[10:26:14] sixish6six: have you seen ashes of creations update
[10:26:14] DerLadebalken: Meanwhile half my raids sits on old graphic cards :D
