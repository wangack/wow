[0:44:14] dmTeh: bloodsurge not working with mortal strike kind of makes sense for spec balance when CBR is a dud rune this phase with all of our high rage cost abilities. plus in pve we can still squeeze in qs to proc bloodsurge

[0:46:56] syztolic: yeah i bought a standing desk 2 weeks and started gaming while standing. i feel so much better.
[0:47:03] JesuisLukas: Im just getting into classic warr pvp. any tips that you can give a pvp novice? @SONII
[0:47:03] bloodstuck2000: @whoiskha_  I switched to fury earlier and it feels so much more consistant. Arms is so heavily reliant on Windfurry and wild strikes right now
[0:47:09] skimansr: hes coming
[0:47:10] Shepp22: a lot of people get back issues from upper and/or lower cross syndrome. usually weak core/glutes and tight hip flexors/chest

[0:48:52] whoiskha_: @bloodstuck2000 Why are you playing warrior if you arent simming. lmao. Worst class for everything else.
[0:48:53] Dracksar: i kinda like elliptical tbh, less impact than running

[0:52:04] strange10: is arms better than fury in phase 2 ?
[0:52:18] Clamsmasher24: Braggs aminos is like a soy sauce replacement

[1:09:00] ooTHExTUBEoo: warrior feeling good in pvp now that i got gear and all my runes, still lose hard to warlocks
[1:09:09] killin999: ever since i saw that pic of you looking like todo on your instagram, it has inspired me to look just like that soniiFlex

[1:11:40] Dracksar: maybe shield reflect
[1:11:53] RitanRitual: warrior has kinda been given the support runes this phase since boots are all buff/not great dps runes
[1:11:54] erawin1990: u guys should get heroic leap
[1:11:56] Haggard1990: What about spell reflect?
[1:11:58] tswxwin: are those youngla tank tops?
[1:11:59] classicdeth: what if they changed thunderclap to thundershield? rune
[1:12:01] myodoctor: ignore pain
[1:12:06] erawin1990: its bad that u still get kited so badly
[1:12:13] LopeScope: spell reflect for like 6 second duration
[1:12:14] biki2112: inncreased crit chance on stunned targets
[1:12:15] MachoGG: mass spell reflect
[1:12:20] murha: buff 2h shamans!
[1:12:32] saitama1312: immune to magic
[1:12:39] ooTHExTUBEoo: 1 spell is the difference

[1:13:25] ooTHExTUBEoo: reflect warlock life drain
[1:13:31] erawin1990: did u see the new warlock enslave thing
[1:13:36] erawin1990: people trolling eachother

[1:13:59] Dowsha_tv: @SONII  + 30 % DMG against CLoth would be the solution
[1:14:00] Kepi_w: Shockwave would be something for warriors
[1:14:12] pointmadness: That on the lam is a priest rune quest
[1:14:27] dreamreamer: Should save that rune quest for your priest and get summoned, phat XP
[1:14:32] pointmadness: mind shatter which is our huge shadow dps
[1:14:40] Pancho_Man: they could add a titans grip scroll...
[1:14:41] pointmadness: or mind spike I mean
[1:14:41] Bahood: buff me daddy
[1:14:57] OrganikCum: what do you think about a double heroic leap? double gap closer or you can leap in and then leap back out. 2nd jump would need to be within a few seconds, doesn't seem more crazy than the mage blink shit
[1:14:57] lylo_tv: HUH
[1:15:00] Kormz__: let us wield a 2h and a offhand
[1:15:00] Arkive__: what’s the deal with everyone saying fury is doing better in pvp? any info

[1:16:44] WcWillow: phase 2 has been fun just annoying getting blown up so fast
[1:16:49] Kvinnoslukarn: "not fun on warrior", there is no way classic era warrior at 40 is more fun then classic sod

[1:18:11] Volryn: Hope it doesnt feel long tho is my concern
[1:18:11] MarkyOchoa: The STV event is trash with all the layering and lag
[1:18:14] Discsohard: Im a boomkin and still enjoying it
[1:18:14] Jarannar5674: 10/15 shadow priest BGs when?
[1:18:15] partytime_piteo: @SONII not bad the stv event is unplayable though with the lag
[1:18:18] ajeazy84: I'm lovin it
[1:18:20] pyro_lurkz: I love stv blood moon event
[1:18:21] Mindtrick714: takin a break not feelin it atm
[1:18:21] Tyfonius: i definitely need to find people to run gnomer with, idk if i can pug it like BFD
[1:18:21] mangocat40: mage is really fun this phase
[1:18:24] wavecadet: If it wasnt a grind, thatd be bad
[1:18:26] WcWillow: fun but we need more stam and stv layering needs to get fixed
[1:18:28] dieugrecque: hey sdni whats your camera for streaming  ? :)
[1:18:31] iiriishman88: when you say they arent good are you refering to pvp only?
[1:18:31] classicdeth: nah im broke, lvl 27
[1:18:34] chilemangx: they are just saving all the cool warrior stuff for level 60 =)
[1:18:34] RitanRitual: I've enjoyed it, but ret paladin feels no different to p1 since they gain literally no new abilities to actually use including the normal levelling ones
[1:18:34] AtomGigantic: can’t take it slow have 5 toons lmao
[1:18:35] inspect4: @MarkyOchoa stv event is perfect on my server
[1:18:37] Universoull: Still unsure of what to do when STV and gnomer are on cooldown. What are you working on?
[1:18:40] 113nik: now
[1:18:42] realgypso: You don't need to be max level to have fun, it's kinda weird ha
[1:18:43] erawin1990: between lockouts of gnomer
[1:18:46] OrganikCum: yea just play priest and you'll start having fun
[1:18:50] pointmadness: SPriest is so fun you might reroll tbh
[1:18:52] waladinpaladin: soon bro they are goona get nerfed if you leave it too long
[1:18:52] dieugrecque: thanks you mate !
[1:18:57] ajeazy84: I didn't like SoD till phase 2
[1:18:57] ryl24: im lvling mine right now, ditched the warrior lmao
[1:19:07] galleq: i was wondering when ur gnomer is sonii i would love to catch it live instead of vod
[1:19:08] AxB_lol: I'm gonna be on in 20 mins and I'm down to do BFD
[1:19:09] WcWillow: twice in a row I’ve been grouped up in stv for the event and we all got layered into different layers lol besides that it’s fun
[1:19:18] waladinpaladin: yeah that bc its fun to play good classes
[1:19:19] wavecadet: YEP
[1:19:28] Jarannar5674: for sure
[1:19:39] Kepi_w: it will happen, the buff they did to it should be reverted
[1:19:39] retnuh_92: melee hunter seems crazy im level 40 and i just 1 shot people
[1:19:45] sfflash: get anything good from that gnomer run
[1:19:45] BlownFuse_: balance druids i know been complaining so hard about their nerf lol
[1:19:55] TakeMeToValhalla: ayo
[1:20:00] ObiPie: was jpc raiding with you guys? someone sounded like him
[1:20:01] RitanRitual: Melee hunters being what warriors wished they were
[1:20:08] madmango131313: @SONII how does tanking feel this phase?
[1:20:31] Kormz__: its crazy how much better the leather set seems then the plate set
[1:20:37] elementzia: bloodsurge doesnt reset swing timer btw idk who said that
[1:20:47] waladinpaladin: isnt offhand just ragegen?
[1:20:51] ooTHExTUBEoo: it would be fine yeah, you dont rely on deep wounds or overpower anymore so a slow offhand is perfectly okay
[1:20:55] erawin1990: yea fury with 2 slow weps is ideal i thought for WW
[1:21:03] wHaCkEdTV: d stance should give 50% more threat i think lol
[1:21:08] Kalanarr: @erawin1990 WW doesn't hit with offhand
[1:21:14] wHaCkEdTV: then hit us with alpha wolf
[1:21:20] Flarewind: @BlownFuse_ For good reason, they gutted us with a hotfix while leaving spriest melee hunter rogues untouched.
[1:21:25] nowheretoday: They buff all this damage and no threat buff
[1:21:33] ybeeezy: war in such a shit spot im boutta just wait till next phase feelsbad
[1:21:36] Flarewind: Oh and shaman
[1:21:39] itsriversend: Welcome to life of a druid
[1:21:40] spy_bones: warrior is gonna be top of the charts in like 3 lockouts dont worry
[1:21:46] Playonwordz: i hit 40 guys woooooo
[1:21:50] jjgonzalez24: Hi sonni
[1:21:52] WcWillow: it’s bad when the raid questions if the warrior off tank can hold Aggro on switch :(
[1:21:53] wavecadet: @spy_bones yeah warriors are already CRANKING
[1:22:01] spy_bones: there's already like3 warriors in the top 100 overall parses
[1:22:02] vKyon: whats up guys happy thursday
[1:22:03] Jarannar5674: @playonwordz gz broda
[1:22:03] ryl24: they dont really give a shit i feel like
[1:22:09] wHaCkEdTV: i think the real test will be to see where we are at when we're fully geared
[1:22:14] nowheretoday: Yes
[1:22:15] wavecadet: Its also kinda already fleshed out
[1:22:20] nowheretoday: There's no magic
[1:22:23] nowheretoday: Yeah
[1:22:25] wavecadet: Most fleshed out class in classic
[1:22:27] TakeMeToValhalla: banger son
[1:22:31] TakeMeToValhalla: song
[1:22:38] wHaCkEdTV: but pls give us some cool shit
[1:22:45] Pandameraa: @SONII Aggrend said: Buffs coming to a few different classes, to be clear. Not just Druid.
[1:22:47] wavecadet: Compared to others in classic?
[1:22:50] Dashing_Gentlemen: druid is flushed out
[1:22:54] Dashing_Gentlemen: class is dead
[1:23:04] ooTHExTUBEoo: hell nah, dual wield gets cucked, the enrage bonus doesnt stack with the rune enrage bonus
[1:23:04] Kalanarr: Warrior feels fine on bosses without loads of armor
[1:23:09] Shepp22: make mortal strike a 90% heal reduction LOL
[1:23:13] zwarlyy: casters are hitting way too hard right now
[1:23:13] OrganikCum: they had so much freedom to make fun shit with warrior compared other classes since they already pump in classic
[1:23:17] pointmadness: Buff Spriest
[1:23:26] minusoner: shockwave ,dragons roar, something
[1:23:27] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[1:23:29] zwarlyy: i get a mortal strike crit and its less than a mind blast normal hit
[1:23:30] realgypso: Every class has become a slot machine in some way, fishing for procs for most of your damage indirectly homogenizing the classes
[1:23:35] FurynWoW: how is ele sham / enahnce doing?
[1:23:39] husaofficial: happy v day Sonii! <3
[1:23:43] wHaCkEdTV: give us a harpoon to pull people in

[1:24:55] tyresemicah: it’s great honestly smart
[1:24:56] ooTHExTUBEoo: @SONII Consumed by rage doesn't stack with the enrage bonus in your talents, making one of the two useless for dual wield. Least flushed out class
[1:25:02] downsouls: immaculate vibes
[1:25:04] wHaCkEdTV: ams is sick but i really love spell reflect just makes for hilarious encounters
[1:25:04] minusoner: spear and  we will be happy
[1:25:06] waladinpaladin: do you think SoD will make it to Naxx? or do you think they will introduce different end game raids
[1:25:07] WcWillow: it would fit yeah
[1:25:14] brishar_: just let warriors bang, that's all I'm asking
[1:25:17] hazuki_15: warriors cant use magic tho
[1:25:20] happytreesz: Convert Magic - Take no damage from magic spells for 5s and convert all the would be damage into rage
[1:25:36] wavecadet: shieldSTORM

[1:26:19] Balg32: they hate us BibleThump
[1:26:21] jschroe3: i like the warrior skull club but i know im in the minority
[1:26:22] hazuki_15: devs hate warriors confirmed
[1:26:25] wavecadet: @brishar_ it looks sick tho
[1:26:27] AndersbergDK: The STV event feels abit better now, but holy shit they have to do something about the lag
[1:26:28] phennrym: I guess this is revenge for all the 1shot mages at 60 back in era
[1:26:29] Derezzed01: bro they need a battle royale mode of pvp when you enter an instance
[1:26:30] Hellizzy: do you have the warrior weap? if so, show it - i havent seen it
[1:26:32] realgypso: No dev plays warrior lol
[1:26:33] quttersraga: parry applies to spells
[1:26:37] chilemangx: I think the STV wep looks better than thermapluggs
[1:26:37] Darkaon: Dont lump shamans in anything. Theyve been the lower end of everything every expac for almost ever. Bout time we got some fucking love tbh!!!!
[1:26:39] brishar_: paladin sword looks like DH's sword KEKW
[1:26:51] wavecadet: They were lol
[1:26:58] erawin1990: they didnt even start being really good till end phase in classic
[1:27:00] Derezzed01: bro they need a battle royale mode of pvp when you enter an instance.
[1:27:04] realgypso: Aggrend wanted some fat sword for his pally
[1:27:14] rincon_: Is the feral wild strikes better than shaman windfury totem?
[1:27:15] wHaCkEdTV: i dont know why we keep getting damage buffs if we're doing so much damage
[1:27:21] fancourtuk: does blood surge make warr feel like WOTLK yet
[1:27:21] waladinpaladin: wait for scaling to kick in... war will be insane in Sod
[1:27:21] wHaCkEdTV: you think they'd give us more utility right
[1:27:30] ybeeezy: can u link mix ?
[1:27:41] peldek: i can be ur valentine <3

[2:41:44] zephyr_inc: Its basically a free for all for everyone in the zone except for everyone in your party, if you make a raid though you start getting debuffs for every one extra person after 5 to make it somewhat balanced
[2:41:44] Fragtrip: isn't there something about when you get into a big raid, you lose all your HP or stats?
[2:41:47] zalaznia: I got up for food and water and predators got to my egg I was sitting on

[2:44:52] FaluranTV: and cracked in PvP
[2:44:56] genican94: its cool that both shout can be active at least
[2:45:05] Saibot102: ret is good im usually first or 2nd dps
[2:45:07] saund: best Metallica song, they were so iconic man
[2:45:08] spleen_eater: are rets worse than ehnahce shammy in PVE?
[2:45:08] The_RightTwix: Who cares if ret is bad rn, they actually made it fun to play
[2:45:11] Saibot102: with no new runes
[2:45:14] Markusdaffu: Imagine how melee hunter feels all you do is press 1212121212121212121212121
[2:45:18] killawatts75: @Saibot102 Logs say otherways literally the lowest DMG in new raid to include ferals

[2:45:52] Rapapep: Melee hunter is so versatile tho think about it
[2:45:55] saund: literal one shotters
[2:45:56] genican94: imagine Raptor Strike hits with both weps but WW doesnt xd
[2:45:59] biki2112: trash blade Kreygasm
[2:46:03] Fierceee: A shame actual hunter is fucking bad
[2:46:06] choochiiee: @killawatts75 last in logs actually doesnt mean shit in the average raid lmao
[2:46:17] Saibot102: @killawatts75 well im not 40 and im not raid logging. and i have no new runes. but in SM im 1st or 2nd dps. so idk man
[2:46:21] TBou_nyncuk: Lone wolf rune should only give additional damage for ranged attacks
[2:46:21] Fierceee: Bottom of the meters
[2:46:30] Anaximander2099: trap launcher is nice
[2:46:31] killawatts75: @choochiiee so the average player will perform better than the 99% parses?

[2:46:42] Noggs_: ye but warriors got 3 rage cost redctuion WOAH NOW

[2:47:22] nowheretoday: Would you be mad rn if you were the top DPS
[2:47:25] The_RightTwix: Lets be honest, the PVE content isn't hard enough to care about how much damage you do

[4:19:38] Stoicgamingx: But I've restarted again after years of inactivity
[4:19:38] kindNifti: because we're more sensative to what our bodies feel? doing sports and activity requires more sensativity to our sensatiosn to ensure we don't injure ourselves

[4:22:13] Stoicgamingx: Kinesology or something
[4:22:14] HarryJPotter94: do you listen to podcast?

[4:23:37] Stoicgamingx: I'm trying to be careful about what I do. I'm not sure if my form is good but I think I'm mostly sore in the right places afterwards.
[4:23:44] xNotorietyx: I have kids, good sleep is gone lol
[4:23:45] killawatts75: I see more people hurt themselves from Deadlifts than anything

[4:24:55] SinzaLive: What alt should i make?
[4:24:58] kindNifti: @RedChaosTV are you a shaman or a warrior?
[4:24:59] Wizwerd: @kindNifti I wasn't seriously suggesting he do it.  I was taking a stab at a lot of the nutritional advice that gets out there these days.  Very cult like
[4:25:04] Steiny1784: is your hearthstone still arathi?

[4:26:25] scrubknightx: You set your temp for the sleeping, and it will automatically adjust temp as you sleep to give you better REM, and deep sleep. It feels so damn good getting into bed each night

[4:27:02] tsetse2fly: @SONII It cools the bed and wams it up when it's time to wake up. Also tracks the sleep pretty good.

[4:27:29] Zanpander00: why OMEGALUL
[4:27:29] Wizwerd: LOL
[4:27:30] AlphaSimply: a tent Pog
[4:27:34] scrubknightx: It goes on any mattress. It was 3k for the whole kit, and i put the cover on a 5k purple mattress. It's so worth the investment for good mattress
[4:27:37] Xolf999: thats siiiiiicckkk
[4:27:40] Xolf999: wtfff

[4:29:22] condomat: wait till they get reckoning jesus

[4:29:36] Wizwerd: and buff mages again
[4:29:39] Fehnix: what runes are soni using?
[4:29:45] Gillbawk: no developer understands to buff other things instead of nerfing
[4:29:51] vedr26: sod definetly needs healing, armor and stamina buffs
[4:29:54] xboonz: imo rally cry better
[4:30:05] Wizwerd: i thought you switched to mage main for awhile
[4:30:08] p3anots: @xboonz lol no, blizz is balancing around PvE and they're pretty bad in PvE, plus its just warriors being bad in Pvp, not paladin being op
[4:30:10] stuart805: yee but that expectation is that warriors going to have pocket heals and just rek everything
[4:30:16] kindNifti: your class is supposed to be all about burst mechanics and straightforwad thinking. So instant heals would suit the class mentality better... and the class design - I think
[4:30:16] ogMansoN: you would have killed him if you had your iron grenades on your bar brother

[5:56:35] AyoPete1: just a quest in UC no prereq other than level 37
[5:56:41] dntsu: It's a quest reward for doing the "into the scarlet monastery" quest
[5:56:47] AyoPete1: or maybe even lower, the rfd one is 37
[5:56:50] kindNifti: Sonii thinking of us as he sleeps, it appears
