[4:58:36] essadis: I hope they bring Lorath VA - Ralph Ineson to talk to us
[4:58:44] wEiRdO_dUdE: I definitely want to hear about the survival game
[4:58:48] Nerendis: The new survival IP will be the big story, maybe a second IP revival (SC, hots?)
[4:59:03] Arocian: probably next xpac wow, new survival game, arc light
[4:59:03] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Subathon information, Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[4:59:04] epicbattlepenguin: That does sound dope
[4:59:06] Densetsu_: @Towelliee You think there only will be 3 tiers and a new expansion next summer? or later
[4:59:08] MilesC453: Towelliee what do you think of DragonFlight
[4:59:22] Arocian: overwatch 3?
[4:59:30] Arocian: lol
[4:59:32] DaCrazyAngus: More games to the Arcade?
[4:59:42] DunzoCD: overwatch PvE mode Kappa
[4:59:42] Nerendis: Overwatch 2 is kinda DOA, so I assume they will push it to the side
[4:59:46] Hybridwarhawk: arclight rumble for sure
[4:59:47] essadis: HC WoW panel
[5:00:02] mezza77: @Arocian you mean Overwatch 1.3? lol
[5:00:09] Thoreya: 11.0
[5:00:14] ac1dburn395: lmaoo
[5:00:16] essadis: even if it's a small folding table with solo cups. i'd watch hc wow panel
[5:00:19] Pallyofhell: oh its happening
[5:00:22] DunzoCD: cata classic LUL
[5:00:22] Big_Wanshan: there has to be HC talk of some kind
[5:00:25] Nerendis: Cata classic would be the biggest meme ever
[5:00:32] mezza77: 11.0 Elemental Lords
[5:00:32] DinkytheDoodle: retail andy kekw
[5:00:36] lordmyer: Honestly I didn't mind cata
[5:00:37] epicbattlepenguin: What realm are you on I'll make a healer lol
[5:00:39] Pallyofhell: i doubt HC will get the attention they're hoping for
[5:00:40] Arocian: have they given up on starcraft?
[5:00:42] jesse_fantasy: Miss me with cata classic lol
[5:00:46] Aidler: The name of the survival game will be “Activision the Game” kappa
[5:00:47] Nerendis: Why would there be HC talk? It will already be out by blizzcon
[5:00:51] Scarhearth: id like cata classic though
[5:01:00] essadis: "New HC WoW Token!"
[5:01:30] lordmyer: They won't announce the survival game yet not this year
[5:01:51] valianya: New IP Blizzard has been working on, the few images released seems to show a modern city in distance with a portal into a fantasy medieval looking other realm, and some celtic/druid fantasy style dressed ranger character with leather, fur, skull armor
[5:01:53] nitechill: Anyone playing D4 right now getting huge lag spikes in game?
[5:02:09] mezza77: @nitechill not me
[5:02:31] Day_Walker78: @nitechill not me
[5:02:36] MereMortal: @nitechill I was while in a nm dungeon a couple minutes ago
[5:02:49] Stagen: As long as this survival game isn't just another Battle Royale clone I'll be excited for it.
[5:02:54] byrdeen45: WOW 2
[5:02:58] TheGiant99: new D4 character maybe
[5:03:06] Bennodkk: Paladin will be annouced for d4 at blizzcon
[5:03:08] lordmyer: They were still hiring a game dev lead for it last month the role has been open for like 7 months
[5:03:13] DinkytheDoodle: Well it only took them 37 years to get D4 out so they are only 24 years from releasing this survival game.
[5:03:17] neverbornlucky: Towelliee welcome to World of Diablo because we can't extend diablo anymore
[5:03:22] valianya: Survival game hasn't even had official title dropped yet
[5:03:23] essadis: Graphical overhaul option would be dope too
[5:03:33] Nerendis: @lordmyer That doesn't mean the role is unfilled though
[5:03:40] TrendKiLLg: Hots 2. Haha
[5:03:51] Peqdevil: nerfed it I believe
[5:03:53] Nerendis: @valianya Did you know overwatch name before it was at blizzcon?
[5:04:23] gassygatinho: If augmentation turns out to be a succes do you think we might see other classes getting support spec... like a disc priest or alan enh shaman
[5:04:30] DinkytheDoodle: Survival Game coming out as soon as new Overwatch content...oh wait...
[5:04:52] itscityboy: @DinkytheDoodle honestly
[5:04:58] lordmyer: @lordmyer means they have an acting lead meaning production is just gonna be slower we might get a name with a 15 sec trailer this year AT THE MOST
[5:05:03] Qwuntumfeildz: bard coming next
[5:05:09] cynicles: augmentation is a dps spec ultimately, a quirky one but it is dps
[5:05:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Augmentation should be good, it just has to be balanced right
[5:05:12] Qwuntumfeildz: bard priest dps support class inc
[5:05:21] Wheva: It will be OP at the start
[5:05:25] essadis: they should just abandon Overwatch game and just make a movie
[5:05:36] Nerendis: @lordmyer Lol, okay dude.
[5:05:45] gassygatinho: Power infusion focused gameplay on a disc priest would be sick
[5:05:53] cynicles: ive been playing it enough on ptr to know its just a quirky dps, not a new role
[5:06:12] nasafato: Just resubbed - any tips to get caught up on gear?
[5:06:14] blunt_malunt: Blizz did say that they will update the current logs to reflect Augvokers impact better
[5:06:46] valianya: Survival game isn't going to be battle royale, that's a totally different game genre, survival game is game  like Green Hell, Subnautica, Ark, Rust (I think)
[5:07:21] Unyates: man i ordered 2 chalupa boxes cuz  my mom was asking whats in it and usually that means they want one too  i ordered that shit she went to bed i got so much food lol
