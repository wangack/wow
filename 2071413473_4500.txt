[1:15:41] galdrelvolkfire: Is Hazel single?
[1:15:49] saga_no: !we
[1:15:50] Streamlabs: Hazel has a Partner. That is all we know. :) And we respect their privacy, so Mystery Partner will remain Mysterious until Hazel decides otherwise.
[1:15:52] galdrelvolkfire: bf/gf?
[1:16:09] saga_no: ^.
[1:16:14] galdrelvolkfire: Grats Hazel:)
[1:16:19] maros_petrus: just respect the privacy
[1:16:27] BoogiePonderosa: hazelYikes
[1:16:35] Zuldak: 2?! D:
[1:17:00] anker_jym: Sounds like college credits
[1:17:33] gordastico: being stuck in highschool forever sounds like the worst of nightmares
[1:17:33] cashthb: let's get down to the only question people care about: was I in it?
[1:17:50] Zuldak: the communal school trumpet
[1:17:52] WhippWhapp: TGIF! @HazelNuttyGames radiant, as usual <3 <3
[1:17:56] cashthb: what a lame dream
[1:17:59] jeffdmk: what is there was really some clerical error and you did not really finish high school?
[1:18:04] tehl00py: are there communal trumpets? i can’t imagine
[1:18:17] saga_no: I actually had a good 3 years of High School. .... Junior High on the other hand was 3 years of PURE HELL.
[1:18:29] Zuldak: @tehl00py my middle school actually had instruments for kids to play for when they forgot them at home
[1:18:30] anker_jym: Do you have your HS diploma, or is that something that you left with your mom when you moved out?
[1:18:47] anker_jym: Like, do you physically have it with you?
[1:18:58] Zuldak: there is a feat of strength for completing all the legion hall campaigns
[1:19:01] tehl00py: @zuldak are the mouth pieces like changeable or were they thoroughly sanitized >.<
[1:19:25] Zuldak: @tehl00py the mouth pieces were soaked in cleaner constantly
[1:19:25] anker_jym: Oh weird. Must be an American thing.
[1:19:26] gordastico: imagine you stand at the pearly gates and st peter berates you for not finishing your class hall quests Kappa
[1:19:42] Zuldak: the chat affix
[1:19:46] tehl00py: my hs diploma is in my junk drawer! w my college diploma hahahaha *cries*
[1:19:49] BoogiePonderosa: eyes don't like to look in two different directsion typically
[1:19:51] BoogiePonderosa: :D
[1:19:55] Elrathir: don't read this, it'll mess up your dragonriding
[1:19:58] cashthb: that's weird, the employers had to go out of their way to check out if you're legit?
[1:20:03] galdrelvolkfire: awwwww
[1:20:09] galdrelvolkfire: lmao
[1:20:21] Zuldak: yeah they heard the pitchforks coming out for the PI changes
[1:20:22] tehl00py: @zuldak thank elune
[1:20:26] Blatsphemare: so how do we get these tick tacks?
[1:20:36] MaddiDJ4: But my birthday was last month, do I get retroactive tic-tacs?
[1:20:39] kynlaeh: oh good i was not enthusiastic about oracle and i didnt wanna lose out on 1/2 of my options
[1:21:00] Zuldak: man that would bug me to see my final grades on my hs transcript. Like i think i got a C in one english class and thats it
[1:21:09] Zuldak: and its gonna haunt me forever D:
[1:21:35] BoogiePonderosa: highlighting text because i've never done it before and i have acorns to burn!
[1:21:51] Zuldak: is your old school still there? Or is the building replaced?
[1:21:56] MaddiDJ4: I’m pretty sure my mom still has school dreams
[1:22:06] jeffdmk: Almost certainly would go better
[1:22:33] gordastico: I had a rough time socially in HS. nothing could make me return lol
[1:22:34] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[1:22:40] anker_jym: Only my High School is still standing. My elementary and junior high schools both got torn down.
[1:22:41] Ldy50: I am lazy what is the all things command to bring up your window?
[1:22:45] MaddiDJ4: I think I saw them do that once in kindergarten. but of course, they’ve kinda put a stop to it now
[1:22:46] witchhobbit: i always thought that, especially with hs lol
[1:22:54] wolfcloudchaser80: My typical stress/anxiety dream involves school and how important my GPA was at the time.
[1:23:01] kynlaeh: i wanna flex that im fluent in spanish so when i have kids i will go to the parent teachers night and flex my spanish to my former teachers that knew me when i couldnt say hola correct
[1:23:05] Ldy50: Thanks
[1:23:07] BoogiePonderosa: it's weird like a former coworker coming back for a visit.. and you're there trying to work
[1:23:37] BoogiePonderosa: hahah
[1:23:38] witchhobbit: UGH that was so annoying lol
[1:23:51] MaddiDJ4: it would take a very very special day for me to go back into my high school. I dropped out halfway through junior year, so to them I kinda just fell off the face of the earth
[1:23:51] Moriku: Ahhh - the joys of customer service
[1:23:54] anker_jym: Oh, I hated that when I worked in foods
[1:24:50] GreenArrowed: i went to an IB school and a lot of us came back to coach academic teams like debate etc
[1:24:52] witchhobbit: i try to avoid going back to any old school, job, or anything lol
[1:24:59] Blloood: its so odd how so many wow players are anti social and dont go to school etc
[1:25:21] kynlaeh: that happened at my last job at a hospital and the patients were always upset (rightfully so) when someone is in a hurry and pokes them sort of wrong and it hurts to go visit betty sue or whoever
[1:25:21] anker_jym: I had good memories in HS and college, but I still have no desire to go back and check in
[1:25:24] themaykr_: my school years were full of bullying and terrible memories so I’m never going back there again lmao
[1:25:35] BoogiePonderosa: used follower dungeons to knock out old dungeon quests. it was nice to both not wait in a queue and leave group without worry
[1:25:35] tehl00py: hazel, if u could study something again, no pressure and no monies, would you and what would it be? you’re already skilled in video production - would you try to expand on that?
[1:25:39] MaddiDJ4: I hate that I’m the guy who comes in and everyone is like “you’re here!” at my old job. it’s against my will too, I just want to buy my neosporin and get out
[1:25:49] kynlaeh: i think those have a large overlap
[1:25:51] cashthb: maybe it's no longer a gas station. it could have become a 5* restaurant
[1:26:16] databob1: I'm in a twitch stream room isn't that social  enough??
[1:26:18] Zuldak: I kind of miss the breaks between classes. Like thats when you could see friends.
[1:26:18] Blloood: Well, i dont like the way people think about wow players
[1:26:23] Perkolate: BGs!
[1:26:24] Blloood: like people outside the community
[1:26:38] cashthb: I don't have any student loans either, I paid upfront - I don't have savings tho :)
[1:26:40] MaddiDJ4: @cashthb if the Casey’s I worked it became a 5* restaurant I’d do something very unusual that would impress people. a backflip or something
[1:26:42] anker_jym: As a wise Chancellor once said: "Do it"
[1:26:49] jeffdmk: I dont like the way people think people think about wow players
[1:26:49] wolfcloudchaser80: Do it! I'm completely clueless with Hearthstone, so I can't judge at all!
[1:26:50] Zuldak: living double lives
[1:26:52] Elrathir: WoW is a cool game for cool people
[1:27:00] witchhobbit: people will think whatever they wanna think :p
[1:27:08] databob1: Most  of my RL friends are tiring
[1:27:14] saga_no: @Blloood WHenever I mention I play WoW to someone outside the WoW player base they just reply with "Oh ok - *shrug*" and that's it
[1:27:24] themaykr_: so you’re like Hannah Montana
[1:27:24] witchhobbit: oh i'm sure
[1:27:36] anker_jym: @themaykr_ complete with the wig!
[1:27:37] kynlaeh: i dont tell anyone either, i think a lot of people in my area would think im crazy or weird idk why i care but yeah
[1:27:37] tehl00py: no one can know we play a 20 year old game…
[1:27:38] cashthb: @anker_jym Shia LaBeouf got into politics? O:
[1:27:40] GreenArrowed: oh nightflame
[1:27:42] GreenArrowed: what a stud
[1:27:42] Zuldak: Maybe hazel has a secret wow account that she's uber toxic on as opposed to the wholesome normal stream account we see Kappa
[1:27:42] gordastico: meatspace now thats a term
[1:27:43] BoogiePonderosa: NIghtflame in thighhighs!
[1:27:48] Elrathir: I don't think I can get used to the term "Meat Space"
[1:27:52] MaddiDJ4: I’ve only very recently started showing my wow side. but otherwise I’ve been that never let them know guy
[1:28:02] tehl00py: hearthstone?! wooooo
[1:28:13] wolfcloudchaser80: The only time I have to mention WoW to RL people is when they ask how I met my partner.
[1:28:30] MaddiDJ4: it’s hard to hide you’re into wow when you have the horde insignia permanently on your shoulder
[1:28:37] tehl00py: @wolfcloudchaser80 this is a lifetime movie ;-;
[1:28:43] GreenArrowed: sigh, 70% left to go on my vicious mount
[1:29:14] MaddiDJ4: @greenarrowed you got this! comp stomp is week after next if you’re into that, that might help
[1:29:15] saga_no: "What do you do for fun?" Play videogames "Which ones?" WoW, mostly... "Oh, OK." [ change subject ] - aaaaand that's the extent of any conversation about WoW with non-players LUL
[1:29:19] tehl00py: i have a wow flat brim hat i wear around. always hope to be stopped by a fellow champion, but no one asks abt the big w on my hat.
[1:29:24] anker_jym: I'm still traumatized by the whole stigma that WoW used to have of being the neckbeard nerd game, so I still don't feel comfortable with telling people I play WoW unfortunately. Except for my DnD group, cause we're all nerds there lol
[1:29:31] BoogiePonderosa: so quiet...
[1:29:43] BoogiePonderosa: makes me think my headphones died
[1:29:47] GreenArrowed: @saga_no yea basically
[1:30:01] saga_no: People generally don't care at all - in my experience
[1:30:16] MaddiDJ4: short hazel
[1:30:21] BoogiePonderosa: you're sinking!
[1:30:33] gordastico: tiny hazel
[1:30:34] GreenArrowed: oh wow it is friday isn't it?
[1:30:45] GreenArrowed: i'm so out of sorts since i've stopped working regular hours
[1:31:12] databob1: BUT THEN EVEYONE WILL THINK YOUR YELLING!
[1:31:15] gordastico: now im convinced hazel walks on stilts when streaming LUL
[1:31:17] MaddiDJ4: it’s been Friday since Wednesday for me. I’m in a time loop but not actually because the days are different, the dates just haven’t moved in my head
[1:31:30] anker_jym: Holy unopened packs Batman!!!
[1:31:32] wolfcloudchaser80: @tehl00py Heh, otherwise we weren't likely to meet We lived a thousand miles apart.
[1:31:46] witchhobbit: i do feel hesitant to talk about wow sometimes because it is very typical to hear about how much the game sucks lol but that is the only reason
[1:31:56] JustFrogging: hello (:
[1:31:57] BoogiePonderosa: hazelLurk hazelLurk hazelLurk
[1:32:06] BoogiePonderosa: Hearthstone music sounds like the intro to Heart's Crazy on You
[1:32:11] witchhobbit: oooo i have never seen BGs!
[1:32:22] kynlaeh: my dog groans when i move her out of my spot in the bed at night
[1:32:26] cashthb: please no music gives me ptsd
[1:32:35] saga_no: @witchhobbit Whenever someone tries that BS with me I ask them if they've played the game themselves the past 15 years - like at all - most of the time they haven't, so I just hit'em with the "well..... it's changed a fair bit since you saw it last."
[1:32:38] BoogiePonderosa: play all the cards!
[1:32:43] Perkolate: Oh i'm so ready
[1:32:44] Zuldak: murlocs only!
[1:32:53] saga_no: I only ever get that sort of BS online, though -- never in real life for some reason
[1:32:54] themaykr_: my date’s cat has cancer and I hope he gets through it
[1:32:56] BoogiePonderosa: i never played this feature either
[1:33:03] anker_jym: Hazel, play correctly! Reeeeeeee
[1:33:06] Elrathir: pick the card on the left! no, the other left!!
[1:33:12] BoogiePonderosa: Hearthstone rehab?
[1:33:15] kynlaeh: i’m excited to learn BGs so i can try it
[1:33:34] BoogiePonderosa: how is it different from regular HS?
[1:33:39] witchhobbit: @saga_no that is good haha, i immediately stop listening to them sairaLUL
[1:33:43] Zuldak: imho you should always play the card with the brightest colors
[1:33:58] Triskelian: @themaykr_ I wish your date and their cat all the luck in the world
[1:34:08] anker_jym: Ugh, I miss this so much. Need my new phone
[1:34:21] BoogiePonderosa: oh wow
[1:34:28] saga_no: So you just pick some stuff and ....watch it play without doing anything?
[1:34:49] themaykr_: @triskelian thanks ❤️
[1:34:52] gordastico: what does your hero do? got stuck in an add while you picked
[1:35:00] mokorii: theres a lot of strategy in building your board
[1:35:15] cashthb: how about trying dota 2 auto chess sometimes?
[1:35:19] tehl00py: i dated a guy who spent so much money on hearthstone. so dreamy
[1:35:35] witchhobbit: strategy? math? i don't know them
[1:36:00] tehl00py: @witchhobbit same. i just babysit health bars and press buttons!
[1:36:08] mokorii: im currently trying to force quilboars, its not going well
[1:36:09] MaddiDJ4: no strategy? guessing? surprises? sounds like my kinda game
[1:36:12] jakefx1: i just pick the pretty ones!
[1:36:22] saga_no: I've only played the singleplayer mode of HS, because it's more similar to MtG than this seems to be
[1:36:24] aerissune: hazelShiny
[1:36:28] wolfcloudchaser80: Is there a player-vs-computer option in HS?
[1:36:54] anker_jym: @wolfcloudchaser80 You can practice against AI, yes
[1:37:00] Elrathir: I'm extremely clueless about hearthstone, I'm just gonna assume you're winning
[1:37:15] BoogiePonderosa: @wolfcloudchaser80 yup!
[1:37:50] wolfcloudchaser80: @anker_jym I thought I remembered something like that, been years. I should give it another whirl.
[1:38:10] BoogiePonderosa: "stinky" LUL
[1:38:12] jeffdmk: 5 is like the worse tier to discover right now
[1:38:58] Neltalie: Hi :D
[1:39:35] BoogiePonderosa: The Gambler? Kenny Rogers?!
[1:39:48] Blloood: @HazelNuttyGames do you wanna play battlegrounds together?
[1:40:18] Triskelian: Who's your innkeeper Hazel?
[1:40:51] Kretyn: 6k? holy shit
[1:41:31] BoogiePonderosa: gnome?
[1:41:41] prettylady291: prettylady291 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:41:41] Streamlabs: prettylady291 just subscribed with Tier 1!
[1:41:42] BoogiePonderosa: haha
[1:41:52] Elrathir: an Alemental surely
[1:42:08] cashthb: btw this so stripped down even compared to tft
[1:42:11] Triskelian: I was wondering, because she sounds like Chromie :D
[1:42:17] BoogiePonderosa: oh one of those!
[1:42:36] themaykr_: you made me download hearthstone
[1:42:36] saga_no: Is it weird that this makes me want to play MtG:Arena? LUL
[1:42:59] MaddiDJ4: haha I like that be hydrated quote. I just bought a water bottle with a straw so I’d drink more water
[1:43:24] MaddiDJ4: @saga_no it’s never weird to want to play Magic. id play magic all the time if I had someone to play with
[1:43:31] idthiefuk: freeze
[1:43:56] Perkolate: They're playing Quilbies!
[1:44:01] idthiefuk: but you had a battlecry in the tavern
[1:44:08] saga_no: @MaddiDJ4 Play Arena; there's always someone on - ...and if you're really struggling you can play against the AI
[1:44:12] witchhobbit: i have such mixed feelings about mtg
[1:44:37] saga_no: I'm terrible at MtG - but I understand the gameplay more than HS LUL
[1:44:40] witchhobbit: i do like collecting certain packs though. really enjoyed the lotr decks. for the lotr art lol
[1:44:42] dicemeister23: Where do you upgrade M+ gear>'
[1:44:59] mcxoney: i have no idea whats going on but im enjoying it :)
[1:45:18] MaddiDJ4: @saga_no me too lol, I was raised on MtG
[1:45:55] wolfcloudchaser80: I don't play MtG, but I do enjoy the videos of people opening packs and absolutely flipping out over a card that I'm clueless about.
[1:46:04] MaddiDJ4: of course not raised in the im good because I’ve played it for so long way. raised that I’ve played for so long I should be much better. like I am with wow :)
[1:46:04] Elrathir: remember to stay hydrated and be victorious
[1:46:18] saga_no: @MaddiDJ4 I came into it late. A friend attempted to teach me how to play back in the late 90s with physical cards - but I just could not grok it at the time. Arena is good for newbies like me in that it helps you out a little and also teaches you how the cards work along the way
[1:46:25] gordastico: are there a lot of barkeepers? I only remember bob because he is in wow too
[1:46:45] saga_no: @wolfcloudchaser80 It's fun ;D
[1:46:53] Kretyn: Quilboars, no?
[1:46:53] MaddiDJ4: @wolfcloudchaser80 that’s how I am with Pokémon lol. my boyfriend loves to collect them though and he gives me all the cards with pictures of crochet plushies
[1:46:56] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: Bob is only in wow because of hs
[1:48:11] Triskelian: Where in WoW is Bob?
[1:49:05] GreenArrowed: i'm fascinated bc i have no idea what's going on
[1:49:14] MaddiDJ4: thaldraszus apparently
[1:49:15] themaykr_: still surprising to me that hearthstone is made in Unity
[1:49:36] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: The thaldrassus area where everything was frozen in time
[1:49:50] MaddiDJ4: Bob looks like he lives in that inn with the daily quests added in 10.1.5
[1:49:54] Neltalie: the gamesound is a bit too loud i think :D
[1:50:17] Triskelian: @alphaomega_solarelf Thank you!
[1:50:32] wolfcloudchaser80: I once saw a MtG collection on --of all things-- Antiques Roadshow. The only time I've felt older is when I saw a childhood stuffed dog doy also on Roadshow.
[1:51:17] cashthb: you that monkey has a big banana
[1:51:26] cashthb: *yo
[1:51:37] Zquidy: what quest did you get?
[1:51:50] Zquidy: oh huge
[1:52:29] Zquidy: it looks like beast is on the menu monkaS
[1:52:37] Triskelian: I started getting anxiety when I saw how close that round was
[1:52:37] mindflayerMinis: Hazel how many wigs do you own?
[1:53:16] mindflayerMinis: between 1 and 100
[1:53:32] GreenArrowed: that's how i feel about WOW bgs
[1:53:41] wolfcloudchaser80: We're setting up for mystery wig reveals, I bet.
[1:53:46] GreenArrowed: i'm so excited for solo queue rated
[1:53:56] gordastico: mercury retrograde LUL
[1:54:00] mindflayerMinis: IRL Trial of style
[1:54:50] Elrathir: Secret wig?? [eyes emoji]
[1:54:53] gordastico: the punk rock wig just a huge mohawk
[1:54:56] Zquidy: raptor can be a nice reborn aswell no?
[1:56:36] Zquidy: oooh true
[1:56:56] OrangeDan76: I didn't know that you played Hearthstone.  I usually watch your pet battle videos about WoW.
[1:57:52] gordastico: have you decided what you're gonna roll for hc ssf?
[1:58:14] GreenArrowed: yes
[1:59:21] anker_jym: I'm going Warrior for SSF, trying to decide between Herb/Alch or Min/BS
[1:59:35] cashthb: hs got me thinking, are there a live services games that got better over time?
[1:59:53] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: The stomper works with the Bear & the gorilla
[2:00:06] Zquidy: how did you get your current damage skin?
[2:00:09] Zquidy: it's amazing
[2:00:10] averageteacup: I love everything about HS except playing it .. i can't get into card games for some reason
[2:00:22] anker_jym: Yeah, I'm stubborn, and because I know Warrior is the hardest, I wanna go for it lol
[2:00:31] cashthb: I dunno 'bout bgs, but base hs got absolute trash garbage over time imo
[2:00:52] Elrathir: stay hydrated! be victorious! stay hydrated! be victorious!
[2:01:09] raindelay__: have you played other card games than HS?
[2:01:34] jeffdmk: this is fun to watch but it is so hard not to backseat
[2:02:02] gordastico: you played mtg tabletop or online?
[2:02:02] Elrathir: I have no clue about HS so I'm having a very easy time not backseating
[2:02:03] maachen: Morning, Hazel, love the wig.
[2:02:09] saga_no: I... think I've spent a grand total of $10 in MtG over the last ...6-7 years?
[2:02:24] saga_no: I bought like *one* card pack; everything else is just collected for free over time
[2:02:53] saga_no: My physical cards were given to me
[2:03:13] maachen: I've tried to figure out hearthstone but I don't know what's going on at all.
[2:03:21] saga_no: I don't have very many, but I'm hoping I'll get to eventually start collecting them - I just like the cards being pretty, honestly
[2:03:43] Kretyn: Your rating is so high :O
[2:03:49] saga_no: A tiny dopamine-hit when I can reward myself with a 5-dollar booster pack the select few times I manage to drag my butt outside and do errands LUL
[2:03:55] wolfcloudchaser80: I don't know what's going on either, but it's entertaining to watch.
[2:03:56] NordicSorcerer: throws the card "smoke and coffee" at @saga_no. Does she tap it? (all mana colors + 10 ) :P
[2:04:20] saga_no: @NordicSorcerer Got no flyers - can't block. Takes damage ;P
[2:04:33] anker_jym: Do you have a favorite BG hero?
[2:04:34] saga_no: brb
[2:04:51] anker_jym: Ah, good point lol
[2:05:18] Elrathir: Who are you playing as?
[2:06:00] Zquidy: I once had a disgusting murloc board
[2:06:07] Zquidy: everything was just plain cheese
[2:06:34] Zquidy: I have NEVER gotten a good undead game
[2:06:42] Zquidy: I just cant scale fast enough for some reason
[2:06:51] anker_jym: I'm the same way you are with Quilboar, but with Elementals. The day I finally got 1st place with Ele was a good day lol
[2:07:02] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: I only once had an amazing ele game
[2:07:13] jeffdmk: grave gobbler is a fake undead though
[2:09:39] Daemavand: had to afk for a meeting and we've changed games!
[2:09:47] Daemavand: I admit I have never understood HS lol
[2:09:57] Daemavand: (I also admit I have never tried)
[2:10:06] anker_jym: @daemavand What did you mean, this is clearly The War Within Alpha
[2:10:24] Zuldak: i know hearthstone well enough to have gotten that horse promotion like 10 years ago
[2:10:29] Daemavand: @anker_jym lol! what a treat :D
[2:10:38] lilhunbun: hi hazel!
[2:10:47] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: Bgs is far more interesting than normal hs, at least for me since it doesn't require you to buy anything
[2:10:59] Elrathir: @Daemavand there's cards and they have shiny spell effects, that's hearthstone. follow for more hearthstone facts
[2:11:42] gordastico: are you growing your hair under that wig or do you plan on buzzing it regularly?
[2:12:15] traansfemme_goofyposter: oh shoot hearthstone battlegrounds that's some variety Pog
[2:12:17] jeffdmk: Your love of quilboars and refusal to plan ahead reminds me of a another streamer I watch. I wonder if those 2 traits are related.
[2:13:47] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: I love quillboars as well, you can get a sickening board
[2:13:54] cashthb: do you have plans of growing out *MY* natural hair tho?
[2:14:10] Elrathir: @cashthb w-what
[2:14:20] lilhunbun: i got a gaming keypad for wow recently and i love it! such a huge upgrade. your old video on how you keybind helped me a lot!
[2:14:47] MaddiDJ4: my boyfriend is trying to get into YT and keeps joking that I should shave my hair for his next sub goal. I said no because then my dad, whose been bald for years, would win
[2:14:52] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: @cashthb we have rugs to make
[2:14:58] saga_no: .....aaaand back
[2:15:00] wolfcloudchaser80: I've got it worse, she keeps coloring my hair. It's getting more and more gray.
[2:15:50] GreenArrowed: he can shave his hair
[2:16:29] kynlaeh: unfortunately i have receding hairline due to genetics so i might be bald like my grandfather or have widows peak like my dad lol
[2:16:33] saga_no: No, I just scared everyone the time I went from butt-length hair to shaved/undercut/mohawk LUL
[2:16:52] saga_no: (and the hawk itself was about chin length when it was flopped over)
[2:16:57] MaddiDJ4: thankfully ive only heard that one from him once. however when I started getting into dying it he requested green because it’s his favorite color. meanwhile I’d be sad if my boyfriend shaved his hair. his hair is longer than mine
[2:17:32] MaddiDJ4: @saga_no nice. I did an undercut 4-5 years ago and growing that out was something else. so itchy
[2:17:57] saga_no: @MaddiDJ4 I know - it's the worst feeling
[2:18:45] mindflayerMinis: Battlegrounds look chaotic af
[2:18:55] saga_no: I kinda wanna do it again - though likely via some sort of short hair style, like a 1920s bob or something
[2:20:03] MaddiDJ4: I told myself back in September I was 1 bad week away from dying my hair pink. so of course I bleached it then liked being blonde. maybe one day
[2:20:15] Elrathir: was that a mechagnome mummy card?
[2:20:23] mindflayerMinis: Have you ever checked out Interactivity board game cafe?
[2:20:28] saga_no: I've had barbie pink hair ;P
[2:20:30] Elrathir: wicked
[2:21:02] saga_no: The upkeep of bleaching and coloring it was too much, though - which is in part why I kinda just wanna shave my head and start over
[2:21:26] jeffdmk: sadly mama bear is not as good as it once was
[2:21:34] Zquidy: what lvl does the amalgam count as?
[2:21:37] Elrathir: does the fake mustache indicate anything other than he's a very secretive turtle?
[2:22:01] MaddiDJ4: @saga_no agreed. except I’m too scared to shave it, but going from brown to blonde at the bottom looks vaguely intentional
[2:22:13] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: Yeah the Quest they had summons their highest minion
[2:22:58] Elrathir: oh, you're winning atm I think. That is pog champion as the kids say
[2:23:02] saga_no: @MaddiDJ4 I've had a completely shaved head before, so I'm not terribly worried about that part of it; I can't bleach my hair myself, though, so the upkeep was also way too expensive to do for a long period of time
[2:23:34] jeffdmk: reborning a beast does make finding undead more challenging
[2:25:29] FrostBeered: I like your hair today @HazelNuttyGames
[2:26:37] anker_jym: Here's an interesting debate Hazel: Is Health or Attack more important in BG's?
[2:27:28] cashthb: like that?
[2:27:49] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: Hp for your tanks, atk & hp for everything else. No point having 250atk with only 7hp

[2:32:41] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: No quillboar in this game I think
[2:32:51] mokorii: wow Kira's so good she doesnt even have to look at the screen
[2:33:06] Elrathir: Hmm, Kira is kind of a bad streamer, I'd like Hazel back
[2:34:40] Kurama__95: KT is pretty good
[2:34:48] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: He could kill the anub
[2:34:55] Kurama__95: If the reborn 3 drop is on his left, it gives perma Reborn
[2:35:14] jeffdmk: can we say if you are messing it up?
[2:35:20] cashthb: I assume after one of your minions attacked
[2:35:21] mokorii: end of buying phase
[2:35:23] anker_jym: Usually it means the end of the shopping pahae
[2:35:24] AlphaOmega_SolarElf: When the timer goes out
[2:35:29] anker_jym: Phase wow
[2:38:23] Kurama__95: Moroes is nice with KT
[2:39:02] jeffdmk: beetles seem to be blocking many reborns

[2:41:14] wowpally2136: :)
[2:41:58] wolfcloudchaser80: Yes. Yes she did.
[2:42:41] Veny1312: on summoner
[2:44:18] Zquidy: KT eating moroes should be neat?
[2:44:38] Zquidy: yeah but dont KT eat before the combat? so you keep the +5 health
[2:44:47] Zquidy: like I'm 50% sure on how it works
[2:45:28] Kurama__95: Hazel killing the whole lobby EZ Clap
[2:46:36] Veny1312: it works with undead atack
[2:46:39] Veny1312: that spell
[2:46:49] Kurama__95: Kick 1 Anub for a Moroes and you can triple
[2:47:28] Kurama__95: I don't like Anub, he refuses to drop his H 10m sword for me LUL
[2:48:21] Kurama__95: EZ Clap
[2:48:37] Zquidy: that was a crazy round monka
[2:48:40] Elrathir: you hydrated and were victorious! woooo!
