[0:04:13] Molvonos: Its not loud.
[0:04:40] ZeusDNA: @Molvonos You playing season 1 of D4?
[0:04:56] Finansdepartementet: Not currently, no
[0:05:15] Molvonos: @ZeusDNA Yea, prolly.  Was gonna do necro, but I'm pretty unhappy with the state of things with the class, so I might go Druid.
[0:06:08] ZeusDNA: @ZeusDNA Yeah I tried Necro out but couldn't get into it. Least Druid has some versatility in it's builds!
[0:07:01] Molvonos: The only thing that really keeps me from enjoying necro is the utter lack of minion control aside from golem.  There is a Trag'Ouls-style i might try though, using blood nova w/ minions asploding everywhere.
[0:07:17] PhillyRhino: Season 1. Lets' go! (in 4hours :-P)
[0:07:41] Molvonos: I'm pretty hyped about my Augvoker though, so i've been enjoying WoW a lot more than I have in a while.
[0:08:04] dirtydeus: Kinda lost my hype to play d4
[0:08:26] ZeusDNA: @Molvonos Hell yeah. I thought about jumping on WoW again to play my Evoker but didn't want to play for a short time before going back into S1 of D4

[0:09:17] Molvonos: Found a clown.
[0:09:28] Molvonos: towKek
[0:09:46] Finansdepartementet: hope they expand the support specs to other classes
[0:09:56] Molvonos: I seriously believe they will, now that they've tested the waters.
[0:10:17] Molvonos: Gives life to specs that they can't find or maintain a playstyle with.
[0:10:28] Cello_73: ^
[0:10:39] Finansdepartementet: would be the smart thing to do
[0:10:44] Molvonos: Survival Hunters, Enhancement Shamen, Disc/Shadow Priests seem to be good starts.
[0:10:55] FuzzyGrendel: Ret Paladin and enhancement shaman would probably work
[0:11:01] Finansdepartementet: shaman tank would be nice aswell
[0:11:09] Molvonos: That I dont think will ever happen
[0:11:18] Molvonos: Honestly, I doubt we'll have a new tank for a while.
[0:11:22] ZeusDNA: I want bear druid to be support so they can make a skin that has the "support animal" harness on it KEKW "Sir, you can't bring that bear in here?! It's okay, it's my support animal"

[0:12:05] Thoreya: if anything theyll make 4th specs or just new support specs in general
[0:12:18] DarkIntentz: Like the idea of survival hunter staying melee over being a support
[0:12:21] Thoreya: if they do that tho, they should change the group size to 6 instead of 5.
[0:12:42] Thoreya: not a good look for support taking over dps roles when dps are the primary players in the game
[0:13:17] Molvonos: They're not taking over roles, they're augmenting the whole team.  So you pick: one raw dps or a support that smooths out everyone.
[0:13:25] Molvonos: You can do either/or.
[0:13:29] Molvonos: It's not black and white.
[0:13:30] DarkIntentz: But the dps looks better with a support role sooo it's fine lol
[0:13:44] Thoreya: i disagree completely
[0:13:54] DarkIntentz: Did a run yesterdy with 2 aug and a fury warrior went super smooth honestly if not better lol
[0:13:56] Provision_: Issue with support is that you need a team, will be hard to progress your char without
[0:14:01] Molvonos: I help the tank, I help the healer, I help the 2 dps in M+.
[0:14:03] Thoreya: it is black and white, for high keys u need an aug lol
[0:14:12] Molvonos: You didn't need one before, you don't need one now.
[0:14:15] Molvonos: It just makes it easier.
[0:14:26] Thoreya: and if theyre gonna add more support specs, ur just reducing the dps slots to 2.
[0:14:37] Molvonos: You're acting like some switch got flipped that made high keys impossible without an Aug.
[0:14:39] Thoreya: so just make it 6 players, 3 dps 1 tank 1 support 1 healer and we can move on
[0:14:40] Molvonos: Which didnt happen.
[0:14:41] DarkIntentz: How do you figure you NEED aug? You didn't NEED them before they were even a thing yet now you "need" them? you just DESIRE them not NEED
[0:14:48] Thoreya: dude
[0:14:56] Thoreya: u can do 2 key levels higher with aug than before
[0:15:06] Thoreya: that is the clear definition of needed

[0:15:53] Provision_: @Thoreya so you doing 28's and now you need them or?
[0:16:09] Molvonos: You're also not accounting for the new, higher ilvl of gear and general upward trend of people's progress.  But, i'm stepping out of this convo.

[0:17:04] Thoreya: its not rocket science
[0:17:11] DarkIntentz: Do augs help make keys easier 100% but are they a NEED not at all plus what's a 30 key vs a 28 key othr than personal pride?
[0:17:16] Thoreya: if ur able to do 30s now with aug, and the highest was 28 before, how is that not a problem
[0:17:35] the_ginger_nurse: youre right its not, you dont need a support, you want a support. if you needed them before they would of been in the game period
[0:17:58] the_ginger_nurse: to many variables to consider, people have higher ilvl now so they can push higher
[0:18:02] DarkIntentz: But what does doing a 30 now vs doin a 28 now effect overall? Nothing lol
[0:18:03] Thoreya: lmao
[0:18:09] the_ginger_nurse: doesnt necessarily mean that its because of an aug

[0:18:17] ZeusDNA: @91Niki Morning!
[0:18:38] Provision_: @Thoreya unless you atm doing 28's, i dont see why you making such a big deal out of it LUL
[0:18:44] Carahail: luxthoCoffee
[0:19:13] Thoreya: @Provision_ bc it translates to lower keys if u havent seen lfg

[0:19:44] the_ginger_nurse: ahhh the real issues surfaces
[0:19:50] Molvonos: Hiyas @91Niki

[0:20:06] the_ginger_nurse: which is almost impossible seeing as how high keys require exquisite communication
[0:20:10] Provision_: @Thoreya now we get your problem, you use LFG on 20+ keys LUL
[0:20:53] MoonwalkingAngel: anywhone not gonna plqy season because of patch, i wil play sorc thats the class i enjoyd the most although it turnt into a wet noodle
[0:21:00] Molvonos: https://i.imgur.com/9MpXdU6.jpg  Leaving this here before I go and get some breakfast, coffee and maybe some ambien to snort.
[0:21:22] Thoreya: dumb meme
[0:21:35] mufongo: @MoonwalkingAngel just pretend sorc doesnt exist til they fix resistances man
[0:21:43] the_ginger_nurse: why is it dumb, because it doesnt follow your logic
[0:21:48] Provision_: @MoonwalkingAngel sorc still seem doing fine, ofc for NM 50+ it can be another story but not many get that far anyway
[0:21:50] the_ginger_nurse: which is severly flawed to begin with
[0:21:52] Thoreya: great push is this week, its only gonna get worse after aug is represented 100% of the time
[0:22:16] Thoreya: @the_ginger_nurse so u think aug is completely fine atm in keys? no adjustments necessary?
[0:22:26] Incredible_Sausage: good morning barbarians!
[0:22:35] Provision_: @Thoreya they had set pieces in last race, no one demanded set pieces to do your weekly clears...
[0:22:42] MoonwalkingAngel: ok ty guys
[0:22:55] the_ginger_nurse: the class could be tuned more, but that doesnt translate to that being the SOLE reason that higher keys are being pushed. for started you need to not do high keys in lfg
[0:23:17] ZeusDNA: @MoonwalkingAngel I'm gonna play sorc. I have a spicy build idea I'm going to try
[0:23:24] Thoreya: what is the main reason higher keys are being done now. other than aug being introduced
[0:23:41] billybad1: Has the new season started?
[0:23:55] the_ginger_nurse: ability to upgrade gear, higher gear per person, ability to access higher gear per person.
[0:24:01] the_ginger_nurse: better understanding of mechanics
[0:24:07] Provision_: @billybad1 no, check launcher for timer
[0:24:15] Thoreya: ahh got it
[0:24:18] the_ginger_nurse: i can go on but its irrelevant because its like arguing with a toddler who refuses to see any other side than their own.
[0:24:19] billybad1: thanks'
[0:24:23] herzlustafir: yo that shit is fucking scary bro im need a cross brb
[0:24:29] mufongo: @MoonwalkingAngel they admitted that resistances are broken, and for sorc our main defensive stat scales with our intelligence
[0:24:31] ZeusDNA: Wasn't there also some class changes in 10.1.5 that could have made some classes perform way better in higher keys. Especially with aug buffing?
[0:24:32] billybad1: @povision
[0:24:35] Heero_Effect: Towelie should check out grimdawn in-between things
[0:24:46] mufongo: saying they wont fix it til season 2 is a joke
[0:24:52] kilowx: I've come to hear your thoughts on the patch xD
[0:24:54] Thoreya: @ZeusDNA ya fire and spriest dmg is crazy bc of aug
[0:24:58] Incredible_Sausage: DinoDance
[0:25:03] PotbellyGoat: Can't wait to blast everything as twisting blades
[0:25:09] ZeusDNA: @Thoreya Right, and fire got a rework. So maybe that's part of higher keys being pushed?
[0:25:22] Phantomstrk: everyone so "outraged" about the patch, that they'll still end up playing anyway
[0:25:30] Noshpan: Guten morgen, Towelliee & chat

[0:40:17] xchaoskingsx: Have you tried playing Sorc after the nerfs? My level 100 sorc was getting absolutely shit on by weak mobs lmao, I had no damage and my CD's were never up, it was bad
[0:40:25] th3notoriousJay: !origin
[0:40:45] ZeusDNA: @xchaoskingsx Yeah it was pretty rough. lol
[0:40:51] shortyforthewin: whats that walking barb
[0:40:58] Provision_: @xchaoskingsx use deep freeze? More defense and full reset of CD
[0:41:00] 91Niki: @xchaoskingsx Yeah Sorc got shit on for sure. I am sure they will address that tho
[0:41:13] t_train_va: Barb has 2 in A

[0:41:55] twstedslap: @sarocus 💯
[0:41:55] N3llee: Dont say sorcs are okay they arent
[0:41:57] Heero_Effect: @hillayin so it’s good? Because ass is good
[0:41:58] ZeusDNA: I think sorc with that Super heart gem using the teleport unique armor with the static surge legendary node on paragon tree will be dope
[0:42:05] Mecabeast: It's no longer diablo 4 it's diablo 3.2 kekw
[0:42:09] Phantomstrk: look at end game builds...hate to see it
[0:42:09] Provision_: Issue is, people have not adapted to the changes. People will still find OP builds no matter
[0:42:21] Rudric_Ice: gonna play necro summon build  if its ass i might just quit
[0:42:36] Turco11: dont forget new aspects in season
[0:42:36] Moobot:  Towelliee.com has all of your Towelliee news WoW UI addon information, and merchandise collection. Check it out!
[0:42:42] tonyr23: Nightmare dungeon tierlist has druid on top
[0:42:46] Phantomstrk: poor companion druid
[0:43:06] Secondbreakfasttt: Druid is the must safe choice i'd say with rogue
[0:43:20] Armdel: all fun and games until CC'd into one shot
[0:43:40] PigPenLen: not very diverse
[0:44:01] Heero_Effect: Or just play what you want
[0:44:02] Provision_: @Armdel and that why you have defensives LUL
[0:44:18] 91Niki: I might just level a druid to 50 and then a rogue to 50 and then juggle them. I can't fucking decide LUL
[0:44:26] OlympicPNW: Idk what the fuss is there’s only 5 classes play a new class each season. Play what looks fun
[0:44:39] Strouss: i still like druid pulverize, even after the change i was doing 50's just fine at lvl 88. but they also fixed tornado's too so wolf nado will be good.
[0:44:48] PotbellyGoat: @91Niki I already planned on making a druid after "finishing" rogue
[0:45:01] Provision_: @91Niki did to 25 yesterday to test, druid lvling was not so bad. Surely with the 25% buffs to damage sources
[0:45:08] 91Niki: @PotbellyGoat I got my eternal realm rogue to 100. But I just love playing rogue too much
[0:45:10] ZeusDNA: @91Niki Both sound super fun! I kinda wanted to make a pen shot rogue but going to stick with sorc lol
[0:45:13] Secondbreakfasttt: getting tempest raor is the hardest part and it can be frustrating
[0:45:21] shortyforthewin: go too build guides maybe its there under druid
[0:45:33] 91Niki: @ZeusDNA twisting blade rogue build on wowhead is sooooo much fun!
[0:45:33] twstedslap: @rudric_ice did you make it to 100 already on a char?
[0:45:56] shortyforthewin: yes its shred
[0:46:00] Rudric_Ice: @twstedslap yes
[0:46:02] Shinji_Ex: sorc rip was my first character in D4 it was pain even before 18th patch
[0:46:23] Strouss: shred wasnt reall nerfed but it was "fixed"
[0:46:28] Rudric_Ice: @twstedslap got it on my rouge

[0:48:13] Affiiance: Think they will ever give us a Profession catch up mechanic for alts?
[0:48:19] Provision_: @Crunks_Lever or they dont want to keep nerfing during season like they had with barb. So they did a big strike now
