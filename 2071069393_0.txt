[2:20:19] sepph_: Can someone explain Graycen to me? I watched his stream for the first time yesterday (always just seen him in cringe compilations) and he spent roughly 80-90% of the stream complaining about mages and mana. Is that what all his streams are? Does he not do anything else but complain about other classes all day?
