[0:28:54] jimmystruggs: damn dudeee u owning on that ww
[0:29:23] dezulol: nice to see you getting to play the game! last stream i tuned in you were perma stunned/kited by mage druid dh LUL
[0:29:25] Darkleo28: Hey ven. I just renewed my warrior win I played s1. What's the best way to gear for s3 pvp/ arena
[0:30:16] trottiga: Also do BG blitz,scales to minimal ilvl at least, much less miserable when no gear
[0:30:20] Darkleo28: Sounds good. Thank you
[0:30:41] Joefoshow15: yeah it’s nice for honor
[0:30:45] Spaceberry_McDuck: i love rbgs but hate blitz. i hope it dies on the vine.
[0:30:45] fistweaveurnan: I think its worth to just do 2s or if healer que rss, bg blitz are 30 min ques
[0:30:46] chuckaroundnfindout: You can also convert that token gear into tier
[0:30:54] Xeliumimar: low cr 2s is pretty fast for conq
[0:30:54] chuckaroundnfindout: And blitz u get conq for losing too
[0:31:03] zachgamegodx: ven good job casting! i enjoyed the show
[0:31:05] chuckaroundnfindout: Yes
[0:31:10] chuckaroundnfindout: Like 30
[0:31:11] zachgamegodx: really good job with map picking too
[0:31:11] Xeliumimar: probably like 7 conquest lol
[0:31:13] heymomimonttv: yea like 32 conq or something
[0:31:16] Joefoshow15: not much but yeah
[0:31:40] lasergazer3: Did you try crit SP? Superb!
[0:31:41] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got A First Look At The Mage Hero Talents Coming In 11.0" view it here: youtu.be/-q4ekr2IRjA
[0:31:50] Hobblefoot: I agree. You all did so well.  Holy  shit that game that went to a 1v1 was a complete trip.
[0:32:08] Xeliumimar: Ven you bad boy
[0:32:31] willie_stroker_99: How much was the fine?
[0:32:40] seholmes93: what are usual q times for dps solo shuffle these days?
[0:33:01] Xeliumimar: Should only have to pay once, contact the local court
[0:33:01] fistweaveurnan: In us if you get a ticket for that you just show them proof you paid for a new one and they drop the tickets
[0:33:08] Badasti: see if you are allowed to not pay while its under dispute. But def worth disputing it
[0:33:15] Hobblefoot: Dang traffic cops up there don't mess around.
[0:33:15] Kujo_XX: I don't know about Canada, but typically in the US if you go to court on those and show you've updated it they'll discharge them
[0:33:16] heymomimonttv: i think thats just bad rng
[0:33:22] fireruler96: If you have the time, I would definitely go to court.
[0:33:22] primejusticegaming: bring it to court. show them that you were already cited and payed the fine and updated your registration.
[0:33:23] Cocoapuffs1: Show proof of the original ticket as well as proof you paid both things and you should be okay
[0:33:27] Joefoshow15: I agree
[0:33:47] seymorebuckets: "Call the constable" sounds like a line out of the late 1800s ngl. Canada hitting different.
[0:33:59] jak_gaming: hey can tear up the tcket if he is nice this happened to me
[0:34:02] jak_gaming: he
[0:34:04] jarmotron: yep. you'll still end up paying court costs though
[0:34:09] soddi: but they are technically correct, aren't they? :/ like you could also be charged multiple times for the same false parking
[0:34:09] Cocoapuffs1: Yeah most likely have to go
[0:34:12] Xeliumimar: it's an easy ticket to Argue just contact someone
[0:34:25] Spaceberry_McDuck: i dunno if it's the same in canada but just showing up to court for those sorts of fines in the first place typically will get them reduced/waived if you show you corrected the issue immediately
[0:34:33] Reiumi_: EZ
[0:34:35] jak_gaming: and you have to pay to go to traffic court now in calgary
[0:34:49] jak_gaming: yup
[0:35:05] zachgamegodx: @venruki ok i am not familiar with canadian police, but my brother is a police officer in the USA and he would have known that you'd been issued a ticket already and he'd pull you over to ask you if you were aware of the existing tiocket you had, and if you said no genuinely, he'd not give you another one. (source; he's right here)
[0:35:10] Hobblefoot: Here is Washington state (US) yeah you need to go to court and more often than not you will have it extinguished or reduced.  I hope you get that sort of chill response.
[0:35:46] Reiumi_: monkaW
[0:35:47] trottiga: outplayed
[0:35:51] Reiumi_: EZ
[0:35:54] shivwren: should have used your cloud
[0:35:54] Badasti: did you say he left his number as well?
[0:35:55] bdobbi: how much cheaper was the second ticket? might be because he saw it.
[0:35:56] waelrick: zen flight LUL
[0:36:10] sourbutts: if you have to pay to go to traffic court just to get the fines extinguished that would be why
[0:36:10] Pyraclese: bind zen flight my guy
[0:36:18] Cocoapuffs1: I've literally gotten pulled over 2x within 5min for a similar thing. I don't think they always know
[0:36:34] jak_gaming: the registry should have know about both tickets too
[0:36:54] Zeniticon: ven looks over at ret, *ret dies
[0:37:00] bdobbi: I had a similar situation here in the states and they made me pay the more expensive one.

[0:37:33] Reiumi_: there's no way he doesn't how how to repeat that action
[0:37:33] Badasti: @Cocoapuffs1 these  days they absolutely should, all cop cars have computers that can connect to their records, surely they note it down... though wouldnt be totally surprised if they didnt
[0:37:38] trottiga: That was the same guy right?
[0:37:41] idiot_63: hey andy
[0:37:46] sourbutts: not me im eu
[0:37:54] Sundagar: doing it twice defo means he knows what he's doing xD
[0:37:59] Reiumi_: yep
[0:38:08] itz_ezpz: no doubt pimp love your casting and content!!
[0:38:13] addyz0r: Man the EU games were insane this time. Chibaku fanboy
[0:38:33] willie_stroker_99: Is exploiting actually cheating?
[0:38:36] Badasti: my fav games of this series were stil the crusader games, though that ww monk 1v2 was fucking amazing
[0:38:37] trottiga: Would be a shame if there was video proof of his exploits
[0:38:51] Hobblefoot: I was not.
[0:39:00] Cvarks: ww super underrated too i think
[0:39:12] Badasti: i hate to say it but id rather watch a dh than an outlaw rogue
[0:39:30] soddi: dh are the ultimate counter to spirit link - tripple stun => eye beam when they gather for link is brutal
[0:39:40] zachgamegodx: ww is a terminator but the control of DH along with burst and sustain is rly good in this mana bar meta
[0:39:45] addyz0r: Matching chan's mobility and doing 25% less damage to him. I also think that Limps was a bit above the rest
[0:39:51] Badasti: i been playign 3's with a warrior... you can def feel the MS effect in games
[0:39:53] dmay93: ive been having a ton of fun with ele sham
[0:39:55] Badasti: its a bit more fun for me
[0:39:57] valdekius: what class would you say is best for someone with a slow brain and who likes chill gameplay with keeping track of as little as possible?
[0:40:02] leeka: rukiParty rukiParty rukiParty  good mornin
[0:40:02] zootsnloots: ww isnt "s tier" rn because of how good dh's are change my mind
[0:40:04] Hobblefoot: Outlaw makes more dampening, not less.  :P
[0:40:07] seholmes93: are dps q times still big stupid?
[0:40:09] zachgamegodx: i kinda agree with ven that ww sub rogue is the only tournament viable comp for ww
[0:40:25] leeka: talked about how i used to
[0:40:29] heymomimonttv: should casters get MS?
[0:40:33] Hobblefoot: I wonder if Sub Rogue should have been tried more.  Seems effective a few times situationally.
[0:40:42] arcane_p: totally agree I abandoned mage this season for Druid and rogue this season
[0:41:03] Hobblefoot: I hate to be a hype guy ... But Destro Lock .... Maybe the most fun.
[0:41:24] famous1939: on priest now i run 2 dispel and snipe ring of pad when i can
[0:41:30] Badasti: 100% agree, ring and frost cleave, frost single target is like half of other classes dam
[0:41:30] Zeniticon: have you tried mastery frost mage?
[0:41:30] zachgamegodx: i been talkina bout ring of fire
[0:41:38] zachgamegodx: ye mage isn't insane at all rn
[0:41:40] Grimm303: even people in AWC finals were like running through rof without thinking
[0:42:00] Toonahz: Mornin ven
[0:42:01] zootsnloots: i miss gpyro mage :(
[0:42:03] itz_ezpz: thats so true i just started playing arcane mage it sometimes my top dps is ROF cause people just dont know what it does and run right through it
[0:42:03] albag04: Hi @venruki  Hope you're doing well! I know you're a WoW veteran, so I could really use your expertise here. I'm stuck on deciding which DPS class to focus on for 2s and solo arenas, with a potential foray into 3s. I've been eyeing Survival Hunter and Unholy DK, but I'm wary of jumping onto the patch meta bandwagon. Can you offer some insight into which class might suit my playstyle better, and why?  Thanks a bunch, and as always, loving your stream!
[0:42:11] marvin1995xo: did you watch naruto @venruki ?

I've been eyeing Survival Hunter and Unholy DK, but I'm wary of jumping onto the patch meta bandwagon. Can you offer some insight into which class might suit my playstyle better, and why? Thanks a bunch, and as always, loving your stream!
[0:42:18] lasergazer3: Have you tried crit/mastery SP? Awesome so far
[0:42:20] Sosatko: I mained mage from cataclysm all the way until DF literally like 10 years of mage and I still main it ina ny form of classic wow
[0:42:30] Sosatko: When DF I completely gave up on mage
[0:42:40] bransby09: Is that the same venfuki name changed or a 2nd monk
[0:42:49] Toonahz: pretty happy still lol

[0:42:58] shugguls: DH - its the answer to most questions
[0:43:04] willie_stroker_99: Does haste reduce your global cd?
[0:43:16] albag04: @venruki how come that DH is the best in overall all things and blizzard dont fix it?
[0:43:21] xBenww: what is best warrior comp
[0:43:31] marvin1995xo: some are set to 1sec gcd
[0:43:38] zachgamegodx: all but WW, Feral, Rogue
[0:43:40] Omnadren: @venruki I am starting first time with the gym this week. Would you recommend a 2 or 3 week full body program?
[0:43:44] zootsnloots: plz no more demon hunters, role enh shammy or some shit
[0:43:44] zachgamegodx: all locked to 1s
[0:43:44] Grimm303: outlaw is basically gcd capped w AR
[0:43:46] lasergazer3: only rogue get gcd reduction from haste, right?
[0:43:50] Badasti: @albag04 probably scared that most of the kids who are attracted to the batman class will quit if they nerf it LUL
[0:43:58] Axtin: any ability that costs energy, with some exceptions
[0:44:05] marvin1995xo: @lasergazer3 rogue has set 1 sec gcd
[0:44:15] Sosatko: Mage used to be such an aggressive caster
[0:44:19] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy microwavepowerhigh WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:44:21] Toonahz: i might
[0:44:22] zachgamegodx: outlaw gets their GCD down to 0.8 seconds with Adrenaline Rush active as one of the exceptions
[0:44:23] Sosatko: now it has 0 kill potential without 50% damp
[0:44:31] carldee123: you still in calgary ven? must be coild
[0:44:31] microwavepowerhigh: microwavepowerhigh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:44:35] Toonahz: i feel like if we practiced dh lock rdruid we could win that match up
[0:44:36] zibnub: interesting seeing whaazz on the SP right now
[0:44:41] zootsnloots: i miss when spell schools mattered
[0:44:44] Toonahz: we never practiced it
[0:44:44] gdodmebxu: mage also used to do dmg Kappa
[0:45:08] Toonahz: the "op" arcane mage wasnt the answer
[0:45:12] Badasti: I feel the same about Jelly
[0:45:26] marvin1995xo: its op into some stuff
[0:45:29] Sosatko: Mage does a ton of damage, the issue is the damage doesnt stick
[0:45:29] Awhopkins: who won NA? I didn't get to watch
[0:45:32] Sosatko: Just like aff lock
[0:45:33] zachgamegodx: the "op" mld never was seen
[0:45:33] mr_jimbone: destro is fun right now
[0:45:35] Sosatko: No MS
[0:45:39] sourbutts: why play mage when you can play portal lock
[0:45:41] gdodmebxu: caster meta Pog
[0:45:45] gdodmebxu: it's back Pog
[0:45:47] Reuhn: @Sosatko cosmetic damage
[0:45:48] addyz0r: the one mage that won in na play boomkin Pog fakegodx
[0:45:59] theodeth: What's the cooldown on port? 15 sec?
[0:46:03] Badasti: i swear 90% of the shuffles i play are 3 melee and me on my mage
[0:46:05] gdodmebxu: samiyam is still a mage to me Kappa
[0:46:08] Badasti: and i think thats why frost feels good rn
[0:46:09] theodeth: Lock
[0:46:11] chaps_86: @theodeth 22 seconds for lock
[0:46:15] zootsnloots: honestly while we are all airing grievances out, pet heavy specs should not be allowed in arena there i said it
[0:46:29] Kikrino: Hi Ven how you doin today mate?
[0:46:31] addyz0r: that guy has so much talent it's not even real
[0:46:34] gdodmebxu: he's just taking a break Kappa
[0:46:43] carldee123: is this the random arena thing?
[0:46:45] gdodmebxu: the fire one?
[0:46:47] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[0:46:50] jayyArrington: meep monk nem had best macth lol lol
[0:46:56] Reuhn: Just wait for the hero classes. It's gonna be balanced for sure KEKW
[0:47:07] sourbutts: rip
[0:47:17] poroyou: oh not just me
[0:47:19] shanerrrs: lol
[0:47:22] addyz0r: and he's insanely good
[0:47:23] gdodmebxu: fire mage into that especially
[0:47:32] sourbutts: thats my life on mage
[0:47:40] Badasti: sounds exactly right'
[0:47:53] lasergazer3: but seriously. Mastery SP with all crit talents. Its awesome.
[0:48:08] xilyx2: jahmill is the best mage in the game.. just ask him
[0:48:14] Badasti: and the melee do not give a shit, even if it takes them 5+ minutes of pure tunnel vision to kill me, target mage and press w all game until win
[0:48:27] poroyou: ^
[0:48:34] obviouslytai: monks lookin gewd
[0:48:36] chaps_86: Fingers crossed for tuning since awc is on break
[0:48:41] wackpoetic: I only recently realized that WDP has like a 4x damage modifier in PVP
[0:48:44] Sosatko: @Toonahz Do you find it ironic how every healer complaies Rdruid OP yet shaman can just heal to 70% damp without drinking
[0:48:49] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy wackpoetic WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:48:54] addyz0r: nerf dks for sure.
[0:48:58] marvin1995xo: buff feral survivalbility
[0:48:58] petkicklol: gotta gut fistweaver for starters
[0:49:00] idiot_63: chill streak
[0:49:01] chaps_86: Dh needs a 15% dmg nerf, nerf rogue cdr.
[0:49:01] poroyou: I just came back to pvp, playing mage and rogue in low elo feels so useless, every CC broken, no one can read a setup, everything is zug zug
[0:49:08] wackpoetic: wackpoetic subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 25 month streak! rukiBlankie
[0:49:21] gdodmebxu: if rogue cdr didn't lower defensive cds for outlaw/sub, the game would feel so much better
[0:49:36] sourbutts: frost mage gets really hard to play at higher rating i rerolled for the moment, waiting for some changes
[0:49:44] Toonahz: @Sosatko ya it sucks i have to drink 5x to keep up with sham mana. its no fun.
[0:50:04] Sosatko: @Toonahz I know man I cant stand how every1 cries about druid
[0:50:07] gdodmebxu: @petkicklol i like ret/war/fistweaver Kappa
[0:50:16] gdodmebxu: @Sosatko rdruid is broken
[0:50:28] Sosatko: @gdodmebxu Yeah it won every awc game ur right
[0:50:34] jawst3k: @sosatko is that maybe because you play Druid ?
[0:50:45] gdodmebxu: if you really don't think they're op, i don't know what to tell you
[0:50:57] sourbutts: what are the best uses for stoneform?
[0:51:05] xilyx2: @gdodmebxu i think sham is O/A better tbh
[0:51:11] idiot_63: the only thing that is OP is a positive mental attitude :D
[0:51:18] Axtin: rdruid is really op in 2v2 other than that not really op
[0:51:35] Sosatko: Druid is very good its just not as "OP" as every other non druid healer complains about
[0:51:39] obviouslytai: laaaame
[0:51:50] Sosatko: Its super strong 100%
[0:51:51] garythos: prob he got kicked out of ss
[0:51:53] Sosatko: But a lot of healers are
[0:51:55] Zeniticon: nerdrage
[0:52:01] Zeniticon: or ragequite
[0:52:07] jawst3k: yeah disc priest and Druid are pretty comparable
[0:52:09] gdodmebxu: @Sosatko i think this is fine to say, yeah
[0:52:10] garythos: there is bug in EU, you got kicked midgame for -150 or you cant even join
[0:52:16] shugguls: dosnt lose mmr so he can get the points back
[0:52:21] poroyou: pve
[0:52:22] poroyou: kinda
[0:52:24] mvpala_tv: theres some stuff in ED
[0:52:26] wardelswijk: do skirmish / bgs
[0:52:31] wardelswijk: for flightstones in between qs
[0:52:32] Badasti: i dunno i just did a bunch of quests and got the cap pretty quick
[0:52:33] dawnovun: Goooooood morning Friendruki
[0:52:35] pvalue01: pve / open world stuff
[0:52:36] Zeniticon: @garythos the reload bug ?
[0:52:37] gdodmebxu: the intro quests to the newer zone gives 10-15 per
[0:52:40] addyz0r: the dream place quest line
[0:52:41] mvpala_tv: superbloom, couple quests in the main area there, etc.
[0:52:41] the_buzzerkk: i use my honor to buy the 5k honor chest
[0:52:46] gdodmebxu: and sometimes world quests
[0:52:47] sourbutts: any caster mains find solo shuffle way more stressful this season than last season? EU is just all melee who Hold W
[0:52:59] marvin1995xo: whats this song called
[0:53:05] wackpoetic: do the bg blitz weekly for extra conq
[0:53:05] cogswolds: Having a mechanic as important as precog be an embellishment seems like a design flaw
[0:53:11] Lash_V: theres some quests in emerald dream that give 100 for free I think, if you haven't done it yet
[0:53:17] bransby09: Spriest rage quit in a lobby he would likely go 0-6 in and struggle getting trained every game
[0:53:19] garythos: you just get kicked for no reason
[0:53:40] jawst3k: is lythi a eu pvper ? I missed any introductions they had done
[0:53:42] sourbutts: literally cant play the game without precog
[0:53:43] garythos: Its on EU forum, waiting for fix
[0:53:43] marvin1995xo: sometimes ven has some real gem songs in here
[0:53:54] Sosatko: Nah man druid OP
[0:53:58] dawnovun: @venruki Wanna queue some 2s with my pres evoker? Biggest dam pres you've seen. xD
[0:54:14] jawst3k: disc priest op
[0:54:17] poroyou: is druid usually good in damp meta?
[0:54:25] primejusticegaming: is it worth playing resto sham?
[0:54:28] dawnovun: Succeeding due to automation
[0:54:28] gdodmebxu: outlaw/caster/rsham
[0:54:29] shugguls: we complain about Dh but its still op
[0:54:29] dawnovun: lol
[0:54:34] fistweaveurnan: yeah but not the nerfs people want. Treants was a bad idea that needs to be reverted. Zero counterplay zero skill its bad design
[0:54:39] obviouslytai: team has to play around it yep
[0:54:41] cogswolds: Resto shaman does not feel good in SS
[0:54:48] kyaii: Stand in earthen haha
[0:54:49] bransby09: My druid feels week in shuffle at 1900 mmr =/ soona as it gets to 40% damp things just die shaman feels way stronger
[0:54:49] EliteDamit: @dawnovun no one’s pres does more damage than mine SMOrc
[0:54:51] Sosatko: Treant meta is yikes
[0:54:54] Sosatko: AI healers I agree lol
[0:54:57] itz_ezpz: that is no joke
[0:55:08] apaine27: a team that used earthen
[0:55:08] Spaceberry_McDuck: treants are just better totems
[0:55:14] SonexaM: good afternoon
[0:55:16] gdodmebxu: wish they'd buff their direct healing and remove treants
[0:55:21] obviouslytai: problem with druid imo right now is getting clones. depends on the comp but u dont have time to cast much
[0:55:21] itz_ezpz: i legit picked up resto druid, never played it before, and was 1650 before i knew it without even knowing how to play.
[0:55:30] cogswolds: Crazy how tanky trents are vs totems
[0:55:37] primejusticegaming: i think healers have to many instant healing buttons
[0:55:38] 3mirrors: has streamer reacted to cdew cheating in the finals by distracting the enemy team with his terrible haircut
[0:55:40] poroyou: What do you think of swapping AI treants to them just casting what you cast when you cast
[0:55:44] primejusticegaming: need to bring healers back to casting more often
[0:55:50] primejusticegaming: <- from a healer
[0:55:55] Badasti: which people
[0:56:00] Badasti: noooo
[0:56:01] Jihnn: Jebaited
[0:56:10] PsyqoSupreme: my main has always been resto druid and I agree, I really hate the new treants. I haven't subbed this patch because of it
[0:56:11] chaps_86: lol
[0:56:12] Borngood: ?
[0:56:12] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[0:56:13] shugguls: HAHAHAHA
[0:56:13] chaps_86: wut
[0:56:14] xBenww: what is the best warrior comp
[0:56:14] Boruox: LOL
[0:56:19] Sosatko: No one will admit their spec is good
[0:56:23] obviouslytai: nooooo. dh is s+
[0:56:24] shugguls: are they new DH mains
[0:56:24] Boruox: dont listen to that non sense
[0:56:24] danieljjohnsonn: dh op
[0:56:24] chaps_86: dh could get a 15% dmg nerf and still be good
[0:56:24] heymomimonttv: @3mirrors fucking kekw
[0:56:27] americanmoses18: lol dh is borken rn
[0:56:28] seraph_wow: those dudes r zoggy shit
[0:56:29] SonexaM: I think this past 2 weekends have proven that a falsehood
[0:56:33] Jihnn: 5 minute queue as healer? rukiS
[0:56:35] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy LopTwo WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[0:56:42] willie_stroker_99: Dh is way easier than rogue
[0:56:43] americanmoses18: ppl be delulu
[0:56:43] jawst3k: nerf healers as a whole so we can get away from the damp/mana meta
[0:56:46] poroyou: I wish they died faster for all that damage
[0:56:49] idiot_63: @jawst3k this
[0:56:58] LopTwo: LopTwo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 58 months! morning friends
[0:57:03] gdodmebxu: i think it's because vs good players they sit cc in meta and don't get to oneshot Kappa
[0:57:08] Vulvayer: dh is op but i still think sub rogues should win against dh. but mby thats not the point here
[0:57:09] Peacetreaty4: just rolled DH and played first shuffle game in half greens. 4 wins and top dam every game by a mile, forgot to use most of my abilities lol. only 1.7 tho
[0:57:13] jasphurt: i mean im having fun this season :)
[0:57:14] chaps_86: @jawst3k lol if you think there's a lack of healers now...
[0:57:37] jawst3k: well I heal so I don’t deal with that @chaps_86 lol
[0:57:42] gdodmebxu: @jawst3k healers don't have to be broken gods to be playable
[0:57:47] SonexaM: I need to finish leveling my DH.
[0:57:49] absterge: hello venruki
[0:57:53] gdodmebxu: no one ever dying makes game boring :)
[0:57:57] primejusticegaming: the sterge is here
[0:58:05] idiot_63: people that think buffing healers will increase healer participation are delusional
[0:58:05] poroyou: @absterge grats dude
[0:58:08] arcane_p: how can demon hunter be bad it’s impossible, they have every form of cc in there kit, an immunity with netherwalk and they hella tanky with blue, those people are crazy
[0:58:14] shugguls: @absterge run
[0:58:20] Badasti: look at the damage breakdown in your details from the last time you  played
[0:58:29] Badasti: LUL
[0:58:29] serratedlove: I leveled a dh, only 2 set and 0 embellishments, hit 1800 in 36 rounds
[0:58:30] chaps_86: @jawst3k Im a healer main too, and that's the last thing i want.
[0:58:39] Cvarks: feel like dh is better
[0:58:39] regulater45: Is awc done or is it today too?
[0:58:52] gdodmebxu: i think they're equally strong into different things
[0:58:55] popzirl: sub is hard counter outlaw kinda even
[0:59:01] notoriousztv: depends on whos playing the classes
[0:59:10] Hobblefoot: Yeah we are aware
[0:59:15] absterge: I think DH is only “countered” by sun rogue, not outlaw or assa. DH is crazy right now they’re def tied if not better than Olaw
[0:59:20] absterge: sub**
[0:59:23] bit0x: @venruki do you have link to ur playlist? so many old banger that I forgot names
[0:59:28] jawst3k: @chaps_86 I suspect we’re in different brackets
[0:59:29] popzirl: @absterge as a DH i agree
[0:59:42] heymomimonttv: been playing shadowplay with a friend for the past couple days. we've never once lost to an outlaw rogue. my fear lines up with his go every single time
[0:59:46] chaps_86: @jawst3k mayabe, i'm only 2.2
[0:59:46] gdodmebxu: buff outlaw counters SMOrc
[0:59:52] RedeemedbyJesus: I play both, but we all know rogue is also a lot harder to play at the AWC level than DH.
[0:59:54] jawst3k: @chaps_86 ya lol
[0:59:55] Vulvayer: i just mean in the match up rogue vs dh i think rogue is at an advantage. dh is op against alot of other stuff so its good that some class can take em down
[0:59:55] Borngood: if it was hpal meta rogue would be worse then dh
[1:00:00] absterge: I think DH caster comps are insane, they just do so much damage + the magic dam buff for the caster
[1:00:00] Borngood: no bops to go around
[1:00:01] Badasti: i just think outlaw is mind numbingly boring to watch or play against
[1:00:04] crymorre: dh dies in stuns, it's not op!!! (everybody dies in stuns Kappa )
[1:00:05] pr1me1989: finally venruki twitch again. missed u bro. greetings from Norway

[1:00:19] baljovan2147: sterege u guys hyped for whazz team?
[1:00:21] cdeeze2: im down to que with your ww monk
[1:00:29] Evoca85: I feel useless on casters and healers in pvp, something is definitely wrong with my playstyle
[1:00:30] gdodmebxu: spamming out some good ol fash heals
[1:00:34] Bernablaw: BIG DAMN JUDGE
[1:00:42] notoriousztv: biiiiiiig dam
[1:00:45] notoriousztv: mmmbiiiiig dam
[1:00:50] Hobblefoot: I don't understand how people can be so irrational about the debate about what is 'better' ... The are both situationally exceptional classes and specs.  Spec hate is petulant and makes conversations degrade into childish squabbling.  Takes the fun out of it.
[1:00:50] absterge: @baljovan2147 yes very excited
[1:00:54] Bernablaw: learned with maestroo

[1:01:43] mvpala_tv: @gorefangx rdruid in 99% of gameplay
[1:02:01] Borngood: @gorefangx 1 spec got first place last weekend I believe healer wise
[1:02:06] Borngood: unless im tripping
[1:02:16] jawst3k: nerf hpal
[1:02:21] mvpala_tv: @wowhanslol the only way rsham is better is if youre extremely good at the game with extremely aware teammates
[1:02:40] baljovan2147: only the mies can play hpal
[1:02:46] gorefangx: I'm just returning to the game and I didn't watch awx ;(
[1:02:49] Zeltexs: @venruki I feel like the annoying thing is that it feels like you can do much of anything to stop a DH or Outlaw.
[1:02:51] baljovan2147: nerf the mies
[1:02:54] gorefangx: Awc*
[1:02:57] Zeltexs: can’t
[1:03:20] Borngood: @gorefangx rsham, ppl putting clarifiers on their strength are copium
[1:03:29] RedeemedbyJesus: @Zeltexs I feel like Garen in LoL and DH in WoW should never be an S+ spec
[1:03:51] higanheim: 20 of the 3s games i did last night had 17 demon hunters
[1:03:51] gorefangx: @borngood oh ok ty
[1:04:01] RedeemedbyJesus: @littlethirds it was nuts
[1:04:02] higanheim: whoever the dev is playing the DH needs to hurry up and get glad
[1:04:07] Hobblefoot: I think that is fair to say. Arms warrior is also exceptional but for whatever reason they are being misuesd or just a hair weaker
[1:04:14] zachgamegodx: dh feels more well rounded than outlaw, outlaw does very little dmg into some comps...dhs blast every comp
[1:04:36] jawst3k: if dh could die it wouldn’t be so bad
[1:04:40] gdodmebxu: arms fistweaver is toxic
[1:04:47] gdodmebxu: esp with a ret too
[1:05:05] Badasti: @zachgamegodx dh is also significantly easier to pick up and play well

[1:07:19] notoriousztv: sometimes instead of music i just put the miestro on in the background
[1:07:22] idontknowhein: I swear it's impossible to play holypal without the mies gimmicks
[1:07:28] idontknowhein: it just feels so fluent
[1:07:31] idontknowhein: it helps to play good
[1:08:19] baljovan2147: bro it tilts me he doesn’t track his teammates defensive. so he has to ask every 10 secs u have wall? u have vanish?
[1:08:23] gdodmebxu: i just want to know what unhealable healing is
[1:09:00] wowsuomi: I like this song
[1:09:11] idontknowhein: Retribuki > Toezpal, prove me wrong
[1:09:35] jporter_: Goooooood morning sir. You and gum have inspired me to gear a WW. nice change of pace from ele
[1:09:39] 서약님: Sir ven’s perfect heal
[1:09:50] Peacetreaty4: damn pally healing looks insane. so many buttons
[1:09:50] chaps_86: Born-who?
[1:09:50] Badasti: jesus the nicknames people have in this stream LUL
[1:09:56] notoriousztv: mmmmmbig dam
[1:09:59] Damiusx: what is c-1 ability?
[1:10:35] popzirl: lol wat was that IB
[1:10:42] trottiga: block to prevent hoj? strange
[1:10:49] gdodmebxu: terminator Pog
[1:11:35] popzirl: he died 4 times there
[1:11:50] pvalue01: it's interesting how the game is both damp and burst simultaneously
[1:12:01] MemoPlaysss: I was wondering why no one goes to mage actually
[1:12:02] popzirl: yeah rly fun for healers ><
[1:12:08] sourbutts: with a shaman healing him 100% thats the play
[1:12:10] pvalue01: yeah it basically all comes down to cds
[1:12:36] Damiusx: ive played 4 healers to 1800 this season so far, first one back in years. just started pala, is there a cookie cutter build i can play every game and be fine for the first 100 or so, untill i have a bit of a clue? xD
[1:13:30] wackpoetic: >Why does no one want to heal Solo Shuffle? >Rogue named Hahahahahaha spends literally the entire match preventing you from playing the game
[1:13:39] LoveStruck27: where coffee?
[1:13:46] pvalue01: it's also interesting how ppl glorify MoP but games back then lasted foreverrrr (iirc)
[1:13:48] yungtropikal: @wackpoetic KEKW
[1:14:16] LoveStruck27: MoP lasted too damn much man, i quit during that time
[1:14:19] yungtropikal: @pvalue01 mop pvp was goated tho
[1:14:25] gdodmebxu: mop would be horrible with weakauras
[1:15:03] popzirl: some of the comps rn are so mop
[1:15:17] MemoPlaysss: sorry but this rogue is shit
[1:15:18] goatskull123: i view CC as a way to take a breather while healing and chill :D
[1:15:24] MemoPlaysss: he should stick to mage's target lol
[1:15:36] LoveStruck27: yes it is
[1:15:43] LoveStruck27: verry chill if its a dh or rogue Kappa
[1:15:47] goatskull123: it's their problem lol :D
[1:16:02] popzirl: good thing DH or rogue wont die :)
[1:16:17] chaps_86: fastest ring ever
[1:16:18] LoveStruck27: thats the sad part
[1:16:29] goatskull123: ngl tho, leveld a DH yesterday, never had so much fun in solo shuff before
[1:16:32] Hobblefoot: LOL and here we go.... It is crazy how easily influenced we are here in chat.
[1:16:34] LoveStruck27: idk how to deal with dh, spam cc him in arenas, still doing most damage
[1:16:47] popzirl: just lvl a dh easy
[1:17:04] gdodmebxu: @LoveStruck27 cc on meta/essence break is pretty much all you can do
[1:17:06] Hobblefoot: DH is so fun to play.  It give you the illusion of being good (okay this is for me specifically) until you get a bit higher rated.
[1:17:06] goatskull123: leveling a dh = best decision of 2024
[1:17:20] notoriousztv: topping u
[1:17:22] goatskull123: @Hobblefoot exactly!
[1:17:23] LoveStruck27: but i absolutely dislike its spazy disgusting playstyle, i absolutely despise DH and people thay play them
[1:17:25] XilliumStorm: rukiBuddy
[1:17:50] jimmy_irl: why would you LOS at 10% lol
[1:18:01] popzirl: HEY im main dh im a nice guy irl tho i promise
[1:18:18] Hobblefoot: @LoveStruck27 This line of thinking might require therapy.  You know it is okay to have alts ...... Even a DH!
[1:18:23] famous1939: youre putting on a master class at hpal
[1:18:41] waelrick: LUL
[1:18:42] IIyena: playing devoker in solo in hilarious
[1:18:43] popzirl: look dh died
[1:18:47] LoveStruck27: @Hobblefoot but if i dislike the playstyle of the class itself ?
[1:18:48] Hobblefoot: Yall know what is really fun to play .... Resto Shaman
[1:18:50] Necrolancer47: Healer SS 4Head
[1:18:53] Sardiners: yo ven :)
[1:18:55] Badasti: demon hunters are complicated
[1:18:55] gdodmebxu: @popzirl shouldn't have
[1:18:59] IIyena: hit a 450k eternity surge
[1:19:01] Kujo_XX: WW, Ret, or Surv as a melee alt in current meta?
[1:19:09] popzirl: @gdodmebxu tru
[1:19:10] Damiusx: Is your spec playable every shuffle with no changes? I need a baseline to get started on my hpal til i understand my buttons a bit @venruki xD
[1:19:20] Hobblefoot: @LoveStruck27 Oh yeah you can hate that. But the people. Geez.  They just tryin to have fun.  (Secretly I hate them too. Even myself)
[1:19:23] dakila24: you catch any of ziqos games in rss as arcane earlier?
[1:19:23] Sardiners: its going mighty well, I hope you and jackie are good!
[1:19:24] chaps_86: @Kujo_XX Survival is the most fun spec in the game imo
[1:19:32] goatskull123: @Badasti how are they complicated? You don't even need to know what your talents do to get to 1800
[1:19:37] Hobblefoot: @chaps_86 YES!!!  I keep telling people that.
[1:19:40] Damiusx: can you link plz
[1:19:50] venruki: BEEAomTTpSA9oX6huYLb5nP3rDAAAQAAEAAgAUSSBKlIJlSiIJUSSooJKISSRgkERKoRiAACAUACJJI
[1:19:50] PsyqoSupreme: do you have an opinion on filler AI heal bots for SS to shorten dps queues?
[1:19:59] Damiusx: ty bud
[1:20:02] chaps_86: I dont ever want to play any other dps lol
[1:20:06] Hobblefoot: Survival Hunter is a small tweek away from being the next OP spec in WoW
[1:20:07] Kujo_XX: @chaps_86 Legit my experience too! I have all 3 base geared, just trying to decide which to invest in
[1:20:13] goatskull123: we're already playing with bots
[1:20:13] driftwood_tc: Having a real hard time on caster MW right now Ven peepoSad Any tips?
[1:20:14] Nimrod_cx: @venruki liked your casting yesterday and in general :)
[1:20:15] goatskull123: it's not fun
[1:20:15] Badasti: @goatskull123 sarcasm is lost on this one
[1:20:24] chaps_86: @Hobblefoot yea its a bit squishy against melee
[1:20:30] DegStaerian: Huge OW changes coming tomorrow rukiChamp
[1:20:36] popzirl: all the casters killed it fr
[1:20:37] goatskull123: @Badasti I just used double sarcasm, ha! got you
[1:20:43] famous1939: what if they did a bot heals option dps could opt into for faster q's in shuff?
[1:20:59] shugguls: do u think there will be any changes before next season
[1:21:05] Hobblefoot: @chaps_86 Yeah I try to use every slow, stopper (traps, the net, binding shot) but eventually they catch me. Haha
[1:21:07] Kujo_XX: Giving dps their own heals

[1:21:24] jinzlolz: jinzlolz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:21:24] Damiusx: what pvp talents you running?
[1:21:27] Schmidtrs12: any shot of a 2s solo shuffle?
[1:21:32] gdodmebxu: make rogue cdr mechanics not effect their defensives
[1:21:33] gdodmebxu: Kappa
[1:21:36] sourbutts: i think dh backflip needs longer cd
[1:21:37] Hobblefoot: @chaps_86 I was thinking of trying the pet that slows players.
[1:21:53] shugguls: take some damage off DH , take a bit off Dark pact
[1:21:53] enviscerate: @gdodmebxu give cdr mechanics to assa :^)
[1:22:00] gdodmebxu: @gdodmebxu DansGame
[1:22:01] Necrolancer47: i dont get why they made it 6 to 5 players in OW lol

[1:22:02] IIyena: eh just fix the blur bug so its not 80% omnidirectional dodge and reduce some of the magic damage mitigation
[1:22:08] popzirl: @sourbutts it's 20secs any longer glimpse would be useless imo
[1:22:24] DegStaerian: 5v5 is Way better
[1:22:31] Damiusx: @venruki what pvp talents you running on hpal ?
[1:22:33] gdodmebxu: @sourbutts glimpse would still be insane with a 30s cd
[1:22:33] Hobblefoot: DH does not need a nerf. It is amazing but it is fine. Leave it be boys!
[1:22:48] Sosatko: kekw
[1:22:51] Badasti: eh i personally dont like 5v5, i just think they needed to fix double shield
[1:22:51] obviouslytai: LOL
[1:22:54] DegStaerian: rukiCreep
[1:22:57] fistweaveurnan: hilarious
[1:23:00] sourbutts: LUL LUL LUL
[1:23:03] shugguls: DH main there
[1:23:06] Bernablaw: how to identify a DH player right there
[1:23:11] LoveStruck27: ok, leave dh as it is, buff everything else
[1:23:17] xBenww: buff war plz
[1:23:21] LoveStruck27: that too
[1:23:31] LoveStruck27: id rather see warriors over dh
[1:23:39] serratedlove: idk ive never seen 2 of the same rogue spec in a lobby but I fight double dh at least 2x a day
[1:23:47] lowluds: What would be a good change to DH? Nerf some of the passive damage reduction and perhaps the distance of their leap?
[1:23:48] Synkz_00: Nothing better than a nicely marinated queue
[1:23:51] popzirl: warriors problem is that they dont push their buttons half the time
[1:23:53] IIyena: just make it squisher tbh so it needs to kite which in returns lessens pressure. dont need damper games right now.
[1:23:57] Hobblefoot: @venruki Look you have seen me in your chat enough to know by now I am never a fan of nerfs unless it is absolutely needed because it is crippling the game (Like the Ret situation a few seasons back).
[1:24:07] shugguls: @amaiyumebaka i had triple DH , double fist weaver on my warrior the other day
[1:24:37] Hobblefoot: Dear Lord no...
[1:24:41] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[1:24:44] sourbutts: nah bring dh down a little and i think its fine
[1:24:47] gdodmebxu: only his class can be broken SMOrc
[1:24:48] LoveStruck27: there are classes that should be buffed slightly
[1:24:49] marvin1995xo: i think damage in general is a bit too high
[1:24:53] boundric: If you need a laugh, finally got 1800 on my alt mage. only took 700 games.
[1:24:54] LoveStruck27: frost mage is one of them
[1:24:55] Badasti: if everything gets buffed that is effectively a nerf... you're basically saying accept that one class is a god LUL
[1:24:57] fistweaveurnan: @Hobblefoot DH's are immortal right now,. the game is way too slow nothing dies. So you need to rethink your position
[1:25:16] cogswolds: Show us that sweet jadefire stomp
[1:25:27] eygton: hey venruki
[1:25:27] IIyena: just need to make dh squishier so it has to kite which lessens pressure. problem is they have no consequences for making bad plays.
[1:25:27] cogswolds: Such a nice change
[1:25:32] Neurotoxal: what makes arms warrior better than fury in solos
[1:25:34] Hobblefoot: I think the game is a great place.  I think there are a few classes that need buffs. Mage, Surv, Fury ... But the buffs need to be specific, not just damage increases.  And not grandiose.
[1:25:42] gdodmebxu: @Neurotoxal fury dies
[1:25:44] Bernablaw: @boundric @boundric if u create dh, u get 1.8k with gree gear
[1:25:44] gdodmebxu: way easier
[1:25:51] VitaminDean: Hey Ven! What's the most fun PvP healer for you atm?
[1:25:54] Bernablaw: green*
[1:26:02] Hobblefoot: Resto Shaman
[1:26:02] shugguls: @Neurotoxal ms and a better way to get out of roots, blade storm is massive for utility
[1:26:06] popzirl: any class can get 1.8..
[1:26:14] LoveStruck27: priests fine? what spec?
[1:26:21] fistweaveurnan: @Hobblefoot You are literally the only one who thinks that, 3s matches are lasting 10 minutes nobody thinks its fun
[1:26:37] boundric: @VitaminDean only took 40 games on my BM hunter
[1:26:39] IIyena: yea devoker could use some damage nerfs as well lol
[1:26:43] Neurotoxal: @shugguls ty
[1:26:47] SweatyDaniels: i literally know nothing about anything but do you think The Move could have played FW/Ret/DH into ret/war?
[1:27:01] shugguls: @Neurotoxal also all fury's defensives are impacted by damp
[1:27:08] yum_nachos: love some dram
[1:27:13] soddi: if you only have to hold down laveburst, there is plenty time to spin :D
[1:27:13] Buffnanen: hahaha kk :)
[1:27:13] popzirl: pika says they shoulda just rmd
[1:27:15] Hobblefoot: @fistweaveurnan Fist I am guessing you are a Glad player or of that tier.  I speak only for the lowbies.  The forgotten masses of 1600 players that almost never have 10 minute games.
[1:27:32] Nimrod_cx: @venruki what is more fun for you, DH or WW?
[1:27:33] boundric: @shugguls that is why fury should play deathwish. so it never goes to damp
[1:27:37] LoveStruck27: RMD over RMP?
[1:27:54] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot the game will never be balanced for players that don't use their abilities correctly
[1:27:54] jukeandnuke: distance makes the heart fonder
[1:27:59] Tippolippo: Or stay faithful
[1:27:59] IIyena: love ww
[1:28:01] Tippolippo: KEK
[1:28:01] gdodmebxu: doing so would completely ruin the game
[1:28:01] Laziltv: what about death knight!
[1:28:10] Blitzylive: what about the brewmaster? you gave it no love
[1:28:12] fistweaveurnan: @Hobblefoot Ive had like 8 minute games in skirmishes man the game is too slow, shuffle is semi tolerable because damp starts high.
[1:28:17] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu Pretty sure no one is disagrees with that.
[1:28:18] Nimrod_cx: makes sense :D
[1:28:21] moowoom1: @venruki  what happenned with VENFUKI name :O ?
[1:28:43] squarepusher_: Lontar played prot pala this morning and it was so trash lol
[1:28:47] Laziltv: how many accoutns are you on at once doing pvp?
[1:28:52] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot i don't understand what the point about the 1600 forgotten players is then
[1:28:55] shugguls: this issue isnt so much some classes are better than others, its that the gap between A tier and S tier is alot bigger
[1:28:57] Hobblefoot: @fistweaveurnan Yeah I have not had that experience at all. Maybe a few longer games in 2s with a Resto Druid.
[1:29:11] LoveStruck27: what if you end up queueing both chars in the same match? Kappa
[1:29:18] the_buzzerkk: i could heal you on my FWin 3s
[1:29:38] backmyre1: How is windwalker right now? Haven't played in over a month
[1:29:41] apaine27: You need a 2Her for that WW.  I think it’s superior.

[1:30:07] apaine27: I feel like my dmg was better
[1:30:08] xoHOLLOW: looks cooler
[1:30:14] shugguls: bigger rising sun kicks, smaller strike of the wind lords
[1:30:15] fistweaveurnan: @Hobblefoot Just as much as people dont want to tune around the best players its absolutely worse to tune around bad play. If games dont seem long to you there is some insane misplays happening
[1:30:16] kaotchen: KEKW
[1:30:20] gdodmebxu: BibleThump
[1:30:22] Blitzylive: owiee
[1:30:29] marvin1995xo: ret dh are both a bit tooo strong
[1:30:30] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu I am saying that not all players play at elite levels. I am saying that many 'elite' players don't evaluate the game in a way that includes casual players. The "Get Good" mentality is fine but I am just saying that when I play it is super fun and all classes seem to be good.
[1:30:31] Judgejobrown: Judgejobrown subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! average shuffle experience KEKW
[1:30:33] dyllbarx: wyd tn? u tryna 3s

[1:30:43] Jihnn: Robertsmurda is the shadow priest that went 0-6 in your lobby a few days/weeks ago
[1:30:57] artofevil_: Glasscannon. Only reason I dont play monk, because of rogues
[1:31:17] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot including people that use things incorrectly ruins the game for everyone
[1:31:36] Hobblefoot: @fistweaveurnan I think that is fair. But I am not suggesting that 1600-1800 players are all that bad.  But maybe I am misguided.  Maybe we should just shut up and obey the better players and what they require.
[1:32:03] LoveStruck27: i like the idea of having the option if i chase specific stats, if the staff has the 2 i need and i cba finding a offhand with the same stats
[1:32:04] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got A First Look At The Mage Hero Talents Coming In 11.0" view it here: youtu.be/-q4ekr2IRjA
[1:32:07] boundric: Whirling Dragon Punch is the funnest button to hit. glad it's back
[1:32:11] swishoriginal: chat im at work and got my sound off, about to return to the game after only like 9 ish months. Is Shadow priest at least solid again?
[1:32:15] Badasti: @Hobblefoot i dont think opinions should be restricted by rating, but i do think the game should be balanced around awc
[1:32:21] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu People misusing buttons does not ruin the game for me. If they screw up, it is okay. People are just trying to have fun.  I don't want to shit on them for it.
[1:32:27] LoveStruck27: so a 2h doesnt seem like a bad idea overall, but that is a specific condition
[1:32:30] gdodmebxu: i'm not shitting on them
[1:32:41] gdodmebxu: making the game more forgiving makes it worse though
[1:32:42] popzirl: @swishoriginal they're good but you literally gonna have everyone on you always
[1:32:47] gdodmebxu: and you learn eventually no matter what
[1:32:50] zibnub: @swishoriginal #2 NA team plays shadow priest, yes
[1:32:51] Blitzylive: how many vanishes do rogues get? sheeesh
[1:33:04] shugguls: @Blitzylive 11 million
[1:33:08] swishoriginal: @zibnub wiz is a shadow legend to be fair, but ty lol
[1:33:08] marvin1995xo: haha my question
[1:33:08] Vulvayer: its so anoying to see a sub restealth 10000 times back to back
[1:33:12] swishoriginal: @popzirl tyty
[1:33:29] FlowerJon: :)
[1:33:33] Hobblefoot: @Badasti I think that is fair for the most part. But I think that it also cannot be completely myopic in that way. I think it is very tricky.   I swear I need to stop saying I am enjoying the game as it is. It gets me clobbered. LOL
[1:33:44] Hobblefoot: @Vulvayer Truth
[1:33:51] gdodmebxu: nah it's fine to enjoy it
[1:34:24] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu The good news for good players is that sooner or later they leave the casuals in the dust.
[1:34:25] Badasti: @Hobblefoot ofc it can
[1:34:50] gdodmebxu: @Hobblefoot they aren't complaining about casuals, man. they don't want the game balanced around casuals
[1:34:56] gdodmebxu: because it ruins it at all levells
[1:35:56] Hobblefoot: The bottom line is that I want a game that is universally competitive and fair for all players without being homogenized. I want PVP to grow but also be challenging. I want as much balance that is possible and want the high end game play (AWC) to be exciting and fast paced.
[1:36:20] 인터넷포트: That rogue is dookie
[1:36:31] NurseBenji: Is retail in a fun place to get back into? I miss pvping and I am sick of wotlk
[1:36:45] Shakeboxing: GM Ven, nice calls yesterday
[1:36:46] cixelp: gm, really enjoyed your casting this weeked as usual
[1:36:47] boundric: we believe you can 3 3 it
[1:36:51] popzirl: but the game is balanced at least more than its been in a while....
[1:36:59] soddi: cut the losses
[1:37:04] Badasti: @Hobblefoot bro you cant have it both ways. The game should be balanced around the highest level of way, not around participation awards
[1:37:05] shugguls: @NurseBenji its actually fun tbh but i main arms war so i see it diffrent to casters
[1:37:07] Hobblefoot: @gdodmebxu Be in my lobbies. People complain about casuals so much that people quit the game.  Although that is why Ven's chat is rewarding. People can have fun debates about it without the toxic nonsense.
[1:37:19] Badasti: way... jesus... play*
[1:37:20] 인터넷포트: @NurseBenji Yeah retail is fun just que solo shuffle and make sure not to take words serious as most people just blame others in shuffle but once u understand this its fun
[1:37:24] chaps_86: @NurseBenji retail is incredibly fun right now imo. Of course there are outliers (dh/rogue), but im having fun
[1:37:24] gdodmebxu: complaining about casuals makes no sense
[1:37:29] Laziltv: what do you think about Death knight pvp ?  I cant decide between that and hunter
[1:37:41] shugguls: @Laziltv DH
[1:37:44] gdodmebxu: esp when you're also in the same lobby as them
[1:37:56] Laziltv: @shugguls dont want to do DH lol its too meta
[1:37:56] gdodmebxu: it's more of an ego problem, really
[1:37:58] LoveStruck27: @Laziltv depends on the spec you play, they have extremely opposite playstyles
[1:38:10] Hobblefoot: @Badasti You misunderstand me.  I have never been a participation trophy guy.  We shall agree to disagree.
[1:38:20] RedeemedbyJesus: @Laziltv If you don't want 40+ min queues... healer
[1:38:36] 인터넷포트: @NurseBenji So yes I highly encourage you to play retail and buy the War Within which comes with dragonflight and many other goods
[1:38:52] popzirl: everyone swears they make a DH and be 2.4 in a week lol
[1:39:03] Badasti: @Hobblefoot theres nothing to disagree with, what you are suggesting just cant be born out in reality unless you handicap certain classes or balance around lower levels
[1:39:04] Wootzu: Hi @venruki how are ya today :)
[1:39:11] Shakeboxing: haha n1!
[1:39:13] boundric: wooo! 3n3 come back inc
[1:39:21] Tragictomb: Tragictomb subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:39:22] Jun_bug__: How are holy paladins?
[1:39:43] Wootzu: @venruki  did you have fun in that 6-0 lobby last night? xD or night before
[1:39:44] gritngrind81: good day, everyone!!
[1:39:46] LoveStruck27: @popzirl because DH feels unbeatable from other classes perspectives, i play ret pala and i feel like theres nothing i can do vs teams with dh, just hope to zerg over the other dude before dh melts my teammate
[1:39:47] MemoPlaysss: I am bored of rdruid. Levelling disc right now
[1:39:57] Blitzylive: niceeee
[1:40:04] sourbutts: what about a pvp talent similar to cartharsis for mages, to make up for damage taken while fake casting
[1:40:07] chergaar: Do you play vers/crit in pvp? Or vers/mastery?
[1:40:24] 인터넷포트: vers mastery for ww
[1:40:41] shugguls: HAHAHAHA
[1:40:41] Reiumi_: LOL
[1:40:42] Jihnn: KEKW
[1:40:43] LoveStruck27: LOL
[1:40:43] renghost22: LOL

[1:40:45] tepplol: no way
[1:40:47] Endoraesh: lol
[1:40:47] chaps_86: wtf
[1:40:47] liddelfoot: classic DH
[1:40:48] Endoraesh: zug zug
[1:40:50] agren13: DH brain LUL
[1:40:50] Jun_bug__: wowowoww
[1:40:50] yum_nachos: love the shuff
[1:40:53] Rottenhood: dh brain
[1:40:54] soddi: a kill is a kill 🤷
[1:40:54] DrJonExotic: DH doesnt know he can purge MC LOL
[1:40:55] Shakeboxing: HAHA team bot kills
[1:41:00] driftwood_tc: the DH brain kicked in, enemy health bar = MUST DIE
[1:41:00] ciciniko: !discord
[1:41:01] Nightbot: Join the official Venruki Discord: https://discord.gg/SGNHyz3Mah
[1:41:04] LoveStruck27: DH brain - see low target = we kill it boys
[1:41:04] enviscerate: dh brains are on power saving mode
[1:41:17] five_moke: @venruki I enjoy ur casting of the copy pasta world championship
[1:41:25] IIyena: 2k lobby for you
[1:41:27] chaps_86: if you died there you would have made the highlight reel 100%
[1:41:37] popzirl: lmaooo i eat bops for breakfast as DH idk what that guy was doing
[1:41:58] Hobblefoot: @Badasti I see. So it is not possible to balance a game universally is what you are saying. That makes no sense to me.  If you think I don't agree about AWC being a barometer to judge what classes need tweaks, you are mistaken. I am just saying it can't be the only metric.  Not when you have 2s, 3s, Solo, Rated SOLO BGs (coming) or RBGs.  Dude, I don't want them to dumb down the game, for crying outloud.
[1:42:20] popzirl: if you go by AWC you see the game is balanced
[1:42:28] Wootzu: @venruki did you have fun in that 6-0 lobby last night? xD or night before
[1:42:30] Blitzylive: LETS GO!
[1:42:33] popzirl: we saw p much every class but hunter/dk
[1:42:40] ALLtheEXP: @Hobblefoot Based
[1:42:48] chergaar: Damn ww is pumping
[1:42:50] Wootzu: Meta was pretty much telling me to hang myself lol
[1:42:50] marvin1995xo: kill hpal
[1:42:54] NurseBenji: How is pvp gearing now in retail?
[1:42:57] shugguls: just let the rogue carry
[1:42:58] 인터넷포트: sit healer?
[1:42:58] Bernablaw: fun attempt from dh to kill u
[1:43:03] LoveStruck27: maybe priest mcs ret and dh helps you guys kill him Kappa
[1:43:10] soddi: just trigger their 4 bops and 2 bubbles
[1:43:22] popzirl: this gnna be hard
[1:43:42] Badasti: @Hobblefoot why cant it be the only metric? Tell me how you balance the game around 2's at 1600 mmr and AWC at the same time. You're saying a ton of nothing LUL
[1:43:46] Hobblefoot: @NurseBenji Depends on who you ask. LOL ... I love it. I think it is super fun.
[1:44:09] LoveStruck27: @Badasti that cannot be done, really
[1:44:16] Badasti: @LoveStruck27 thats my point
[1:44:20] popzirl: @NurseBenji you can get full gear in a few days
[1:44:25] popzirl: cos crafting
[1:44:41] LoveStruck27: @Badasti the skill discrepency from those 2 levels is insanely high
[1:44:43] renghost22: The game should not be balanced around only AWC...and fortunately it's not only balanced around that
[1:44:51] Kujo_XX: roflmao
[1:45:00] Kujo_XX: The commentary this lobby is 100
[1:45:08] LoveStruck27: i'm a 2k- 2.2k player, i play vs anyone below 1.8 its like sleeper mode
[1:45:10] 인터넷포트: LMFAO that rogue is gune be pissed
[1:45:11] JackOfAllApocalypses: this is violent
[1:45:17] popzirl: right what did ppl eat for bfast today
[1:45:24] Badasti: @LoveStruck27 exactly, the game should be balanced around the highest level of play, if that means same player will be 1800 on a dh and 1500 on a mage then so be it
[1:45:25] popzirl: so much hate ><
[1:45:40] chaps_86: nice comback
[1:45:43] Blitzylive: YES!!
[1:46:02] Wootzu: @venruki Meta was pretty much telling me to hang myself in that lobby lol
[1:46:09] soddi: thanks for artificially making it exciting for us
[1:46:11] Reuhn: fun to watch at least
[1:46:17] ALLtheEXP: I think they should stop balancing the game and bring back the Retpacolypse
[1:46:19] Reiumi_: HUH
[1:46:21] Wootzu: yes
[1:46:47] Wootzu: on stream not ingame
[1:47:02] gdodmebxu: i think it's best to not watch streams of the lobbies you're in
[1:47:03] Hobblefoot: @Badasti Well you are starting to take a bit more of a confrontational tone, with all due respect, so I think I am done.  I don't want it balanced around 1600 MMR. I am just saying all players should be considered in evaluating the game.  I do think it vital to give the most analysis to the highest level players because they are the ones playing the game most optimally.  I think that makes sense. I just think you have to consider all factors.
[1:47:04] stonymontana_tv: tgat was crazt
[1:47:08] stonymontana_tv: that was crazy
[1:47:17] LoveStruck27: @Badasti yes, but  getting boosted 300 mmr from the class itself means the class is stronger than others, should probably be looked at
[1:47:37] hagridbigdps: As a fresh 1st character ilvl 425+ what would you start doing after clearing emerald questline?
[1:47:51] LoveStruck27: as you stated a mage with 1.5 jumps on dh to 1.8 the skill being on the same level its deffinently a class issue
[1:48:04] chaps_86: @hagridbigdps spam bgs for honor gear
[1:48:05] Hobblefoot: @LoveStruck27 Another fair point worth considering.
[1:48:06] renghost22: @Hobblefoot The game is balanced around a lot of factors fortunately. The reality is that most 1600 players don't fully utilize their class / spec and that's why you can't balance around 1600 (which i know you agree with)
[1:48:14] gdodmebxu: @LoveStruck27 or it means they're better at the other class?
[1:48:30] gdodmebxu: Kappa
[1:48:38] Hobblefoot: @renghost22 You are right. I 100% agree with you.
[1:48:39] hagridbigdps: @chaps_86 then i won't get accepted in keys cuz i have honor gear... NotLikeThis
[1:48:48] nikthevoker: sup @venruki hows it going man
[1:48:55] LoveStruck27: @gdodmebxu that could be a possibility
[1:49:10] renghost22: I mean, I can play resto shaman at 2.4 and I can't even come close to touching DH at 2k yet... so I mean, it's not like playing DH is free.
[1:49:16] Pexxal: @hagridbigdps make your own grp with your key
[1:49:26] LoveStruck27: but when you tell me you're hardstuck on a class at 1.5 and jump to a meta one, and jump 300 mmr i don't think the skill is the problem
[1:49:39] hagridbigdps: Okay cool thanks
[1:49:50] Badasti: @LoveStruck27 point is if at R1 those classes are balanced, but at lower levels one class will achieve better results than another (which is exactly what happens) then thats just how it is
[1:50:03] Badasti: unless you make all classes a copy paste and homogenise the game further it will always be that way
[1:50:04] renghost22: @LoveStruck27 If you play a meta class at the same skill level, your rating will likely be higher, yes. But you still have to play that class at the same level in order to make that progress unless it's massively overtuned.
[1:50:16] shugguls: @LoveStruck27 100% agree, was same with ret patch , demo season one and ret patch
[1:50:21] Jun_bug__: Do you guys not understand what it would take to acually balance the amount of classes with all the extra crap sprinkled on top?
[1:50:24] popzirl: @hagridbigdps pve is diff but can def start low keys w honor gear lol and do some arenas for conq and get 4set too
[1:50:28] gdodmebxu: @LoveStruck27 i mean, yeah, but i don't think what you're saying holds in general. I'm always higher rated on my main classes and it has very little to do with the classes or balance and more to do with experience on said classes
[1:50:29] Hobblefoot: See I am glad everyone is coming around!
[1:50:48] ALLtheEXP: I am glad I was right all along
[1:50:57] Hobblefoot: @ALLtheEXP We are the chosen ones.
[1:51:04] gdodmebxu: there are always fotm classes
[1:51:05] ALLtheEXP: @Hobblefoot Based gods, rly
[1:51:06] LoveStruck27: @Badasti i agree, as i said, i melt people below 2k mmr on mage , priest , pala even dk, its just that rogue/dh are so predominant and opressing in playstyle i just cba dealing with it
[1:51:11] gdodmebxu: and players that only play those Kappa
[1:51:12] Jun_bug__: Everyone says enhance is garbage Bigdam proves with skill you can play one
[1:51:19] Tragictomb: I just want the mage elite set they need to make mage easier 😂
[1:51:29] StromicusRex: who tf is kazenokage
[1:51:31] LoveStruck27: and those 2 classes are curently meta
[1:51:57] popzirl: so is lock and mage and shaman
[1:52:04] popzirl: and monk
[1:52:09] popzirl: game is p balanced
[1:52:14] Hobblefoot: and Resto Druid
[1:52:21] popzirl: more balanced than its been in a while
[1:52:32] Hobblefoot: @popzirl You complete me. LOL
[1:52:35] gdodmebxu: mage is meta because of other meta classes
[1:52:40] gdodmebxu: you take them away and they are absolutely not
[1:52:46] popzirl: still meta
[1:52:49] Jun_bug__: ^
[1:53:02] gdodmebxu: you should log onto a mage
[1:53:03] gdodmebxu: Kappa
[1:53:15] gdodmebxu: compare what you have to do to win with your dh
[1:53:19] popzirl: i play mage a lil
[1:53:25] Jun_bug__: I have got clobbered due to 0 Experience
[1:53:27] Hobblefoot: I used the word Tweak for a reason.  No classes need sweeping changes.  Shit ... I forgot Frost DK.  But that is just because it is not fun to play. Haha
[1:53:58] Jun_bug__: mage is a pretty high skilled needed to play class imo
[1:54:06] popzirl: a good mage controls any lobby its just high skill cap
[1:54:15] gdodmebxu: KEKW
[1:54:23] gdodmebxu: mage depends on lobby
[1:54:24] Reiumi_: I don't play it

[1:55:47] fistweaveurnan: Respect for saying it how it is
[1:55:48] LoveStruck27: i looked at it, i'd rather go play HC classic
[1:55:52] popzirl: i agree =/ and i loved p1 but i think the wait for p2 killed it
[1:55:54] Cocoapuffs1: you dont wanna relvl for the 7th time in the same game?
[1:56:00] Badasti: good, good. Retail is where you are needed. I wish there was a mr burns emote
[1:56:02] ayosteviey: I saw someone hit 40 on the first day of phase 2 and his stream time was lik 20 hours in. Yikes
[1:56:02] LoveStruck27: if i was to choose between Sod and HC
[1:56:04] StromicusRex: i logged in on friday, did one solo stockades run, then logged off and haven't been on since. which is not good cuz i'm the main tank of our raid

[1:57:56] haendicap: nvm im dumb
[1:57:58] blkylol: Maturing is realizing DF is a great expansion
[1:58:00] boundric: the LFR color is the best version of that mog. which sucks

[1:58:38] wowsuomi: Its just a saying
[1:58:45] DrewPBallz18: Im having so much fun smoking people on sub in 1800 mmr and lower in twos, do you think when i get higher sub is gonna be shut down a lot more and unplayable in a way?
[1:58:55] Hobblefoot: @venruki cares about his loyal followers not the fly-by-night kids that want to see him play a specific game.  He is a devoted streamer that loves his chat like family and has the courage to play a game he loves and now kowtow to cognitive dissidence.
[1:58:58] OttoFrank1945: That was a pretty fast Q no?
[1:59:05] smokechiefx: You play the dodge buff into this yeah? 100%
[1:59:22] blkylol: @blkylol Yea, its up there for sure
[1:59:29] LoveStruck27: @DrewPBallz18 not as in shut down, people will know when and how to fight you, so you wont be facerolling over them
[1:59:42] waelrick: LUL

[2:00:16] Synkz_00: Nothing disappoints me more than kowtowing to cognitive dissidence
[2:00:36] smokechiefx: what is the addon that puts the big buff or debuff near their character portrat?
[2:00:42] SirBeaverTeeth: need to see some of that prenatural soothing mist casts
[2:00:51] LoveStruck27: @DrewPBallz18 sub will still be good, just harder fights overall, cooldowns will be spent accordingly, so when you dance you'll see them peel you off, cc you, or avoid you if possible, so feels like you will be "weaker"
[2:01:09] Aro725: is whirling dragon punch buffed in pvp? cause it hits like a wet noodle in pve
[2:01:13] atorob: void elf on someone this game lol
[2:01:19] itsHomicydal: venruki best music NA
[2:01:20] Hobblefoot: @Synkz_00 You think it was easy typing that with a straight face???  Nope.  :P  I am not sure what it even means!
[2:01:24] bquiason: coming back to wow after a long time whats cognitive dissidence?
[2:01:25] Reiumi_: KEKW
[2:01:27] Aro725: HOLY thats awesome
[2:01:28] isseswagger: since when?
[2:01:35] lasergazer3: isnt it weird that DH can get their weapon back (from Disarm and such) when doing Vengeful Retreat??
[2:01:50] zachgamegodx: that button will never feel good to press with the current ww dmg kit
[2:01:55] LoveStruck27: @DrewPBallz18 so good set ups matter more in higher rating, so you will be relying on your teammate to combo with you
[2:02:02] whittyxo: i tab in to u blasting old BMTH and playing ww? wtf is this mop era? holy nostalgia
[2:02:12] zachgamegodx: i know it does alot of dmg, but the reduced cooldown on all the abilities make it so hard to fit in without munching procs

[2:04:10] isseswagger: XD
[2:04:11] Badasti: clobbering everyone in the lobby
[2:04:15] LoveStruck27: HOW?
[2:04:17] Blitzylive: LOL
[2:04:18] Ronn_Deezy: Kappa
[2:04:20] LoveStruck27: sure Kappa
[2:04:23] Badasti: LUL
[2:04:26] Hobblefoot: @pharmztko I just call him Elli ... Sadly it led to him filing a restraining order against me.
[2:04:32] isseswagger: blizzcon #2
[2:04:33] gelatokush: im hard stuck at 1600 in ss on my healer an im 2.4xp so it make sense
[2:04:36] LoveStruck27: rank 1 healer over rank 1 dps
[2:04:36] whittyxo: r1 healer vs 2k healer is a massive gap between r1 dps vs 2k dps xD
[2:04:53] LoveStruck27: so healers are better than the dps players? thats what you saying?
[2:05:03] T00zs: r1 healer is harder in shuffle imo
[2:05:30] LoveStruck27: i know, i play healer, i hate shuffle
[2:05:36] shugguls: thing is if a healer goes 6/0 all the dps go 3 and get no pioints
[2:05:49] whittyxo: @LoveStruck27 my condolences, on behalf of all zug dps i apologize for lining u all game
[2:06:19] LoveStruck27: @whittyxo no no, wait, you seen an arcane mage fucking explore the entire arena, thats far more pain than zug zug
[2:06:28] whittyxo: @LoveStruck27 LMFAOO
[2:06:31] poroyou: stat prio on WW?
[2:06:38] whittyxo: @poroyou mast > vers > crit
[2:06:46] stealthwalker99: smurfing as dps vs smurfing as healer matters a lot less. For dps 3 people are affected and you can still lose. Healer smurf just 6-0's and 1 person affected
[2:06:50] shugguls: @poroyou mast / vers
[2:06:55] Axtin: ya thats how i feel on ww
[2:06:58] Hobblefoot: I just realized why I like all the crap you guys hate.  It is BECAUSE I am terrible at it, so I don't really have a horse in the race so to speak.   Hell, my Resto Shaman is like 1200 MMR and I have a blast.
[2:07:17] gelatokush: healing ss is a mindset i dont have, its an extra skill required to be a good healer in ss.
[2:07:19] LoveStruck27: @whittyxo i take zug zug over a mage that just goes explorer mode with blink in/out back in somwhere in narnia, back behind pillar
[2:07:42] whittyxo: @LoveStruck27 is that the same mage that lines and fights across the map all game has to block then blames u for it
[2:07:56] LoveStruck27: yup
[2:08:03] LoveStruck27: that is best pain
[2:08:06] Axtin: its like all ww has is output
[2:08:24] Axtin: some cc here and there
[2:08:29] peterbien: mage now, please
[2:08:38] whittyxo: imo ww could use work but feels like its in the best spot its been in a while
[2:09:05] Reuhn: did anyone see an enhance this season?
[2:09:29] LoveStruck27: decent mobility good damage, maybe slight buff on survivability? but it feels good when you have them up, so idk if ww should be changed too much
[2:09:49] whittyxo: revert karma nerfs and lower cd on leg sweep and i think it'd be a bit better
[2:09:55] whittyxo: or at least lower sweep cd
[2:10:12] LoveStruck27: @Reuhn verry few, rare above 2k, id say i saw 2 in over 500 games
[2:10:16] whittyxo: 60 sec on our only real cc is absurd
[2:10:24] LoveStruck27: maybe more below
[2:10:32] heymomimonttv: @Reuhn a couple yea. saul and bigdam never gonna stop enh. but i've seen normal enh players at lower mmr yea. not many tho
[2:10:36] gelatokush: enh is not very good
[2:10:47] DrewPBallz18: is sub unplayable after 2k in twos? or should i just suck it up and play outlaw
[2:10:47] lasergazer3: Do we know what the new season bonusses are gonna be?
[2:10:50] LoveStruck27: but i do play on EU, and lets be honest, EU will perma FOTM
[2:10:50] Badasti: Ven, do you have a macro or smth to target static token? or click it manually?
[2:10:58] lasergazer3: set bonus' i mean
[2:11:06] wyldeshock: on the way to put my dog down help
[2:11:18] whspe: bigdam
[2:11:18] atorob: Bigdam
[2:11:20] whittyxo: @lasergazer3 theyre just reusing old ones from previous DF seasons, there was a huge poll
[2:11:24] LoveStruck27: i feel they are extremely rare at least on EU
[2:11:24] dakila24: i'm stuck in the bigdam loop on my mage rn it's hell
[2:11:26] IIyena: ive seen several enh
[2:11:27] chaps_86: @lasergazer3 good point, did they post the winners of the tier set voting?
[2:11:30] VitaminDean: What's a good way to learn PvP healing as a new player? Just bite the pillow and go Solo Shuffle?
[2:11:32] IIyena: all the same guy with different chars
[2:11:37] heymomimonttv: @wyldeshock keep your head up and know you gave them a great life. thinking of you
[2:11:38] thisisthotcaller: i genuinely dont understand how bigdam stays alive - enhance feels so squishy
[2:11:43] whittyxo: tier set bonuses were posted on wowhead, yes
[2:11:47] insuranceguy: Did you play Monk since MoP or did you pick ut up later?
[2:11:49] LoveStruck27: @VitaminDean what class?
[2:11:57] VitaminDean: @LoveStruck27 Holy pally
[2:11:59] LoveStruck27: @VitaminDean what kind of playstyle you like?
[2:12:00] Rodneysaurus_: Hey Ven, it's been a while since I tuned in. Why the new monk?
[2:12:05] whittyxo: mf VENFUKI
[2:12:19] Necrolancer47: u playing cata mage?
[2:12:26] khairianwow: @venruki you got any tips for pvp? i really want to get into it.
[2:12:27] troniixlol: wth is wrong with mage??
[2:12:36] isseswagger: when did wdp get buffed?
[2:12:43] MemoPlaysss: they should remove mobility and burst damage and buff tankyness
[2:13:02] atorob: they need to cut back the 50 million blinks and buff their shields
[2:13:10] Tippolippo: I think frost mage is super fun. I main dh, and rdruid. The pump when you set up right is insane
[2:13:12] LoveStruck27: mage feels terrible, every time i play it i get perma tunneled, but i play frost...
[2:13:13] mvpala_tv: i agree. i mained fire since wod and the play style has gotten to the point where you have to be an absolute r1 to even play it - also play w a rogue
[2:13:13] heymomimonttv: mage kinda just feels like a cc bot atm
[2:13:25] Badasti: I agree every time i push in for cc i get punished heavily, most of the time I feel like I just have to sit back and do my mythic parse
[2:13:32] LoveStruck27: brutal
[2:13:48] Darkleo28: I feel like mage is in a really weird spot where if they get a damage buff they'll be too strong.
[2:13:52] lehmannation2: dat fan
[2:13:54] Blitzylive: didn't someone play frost in AWC?
[2:14:09] Darkleo28: But they don't really need a damage nerd either
[2:14:09] IIyena: meeps team did yeah
[2:14:19] Reuhn: I don't even know what to kick on frost mage. ray of frost?
[2:14:24] zachgamegodx: as joke or capitulation pick only
[2:14:25] LoveStruck27: its burtal in 3v3, they perma on you or just focus on stopping anything you wanna do, all you can hope for is brainfreeze procs
[2:14:28] Magottx: YEA pmake played it.. lmao
[2:14:30] Darkleo28: Maybe fire needs more damage
[2:14:30] lasergazer3: SP and Affli is where its at for me, when it comes to casters
[2:14:32] whittyxo: yo that CML clutch game tho
[2:14:48] whittyxo: the amount of adrenaline gum was playing off of for the rest of that series must have been insane LOL
[2:14:50] LoveStruck27: not really
[2:14:50] Badasti: @Reuhn kicking any frost spell is good if you are close to a kill - they cant block if you kick frost
[2:14:59] mvpala_tv: yeah mage feels too far gone
[2:15:00] illEvan11_11: ever since the armor/stam patch changes, mage has felt pretty weak and its hard to fully kill someone
[2:15:07] isseswagger: is blade edge still in shuffle?
[2:15:10] Blitzylive: arcane did so well though in AWC
[2:15:11] Vigi9413: do you think Blizz will fix dks? lol
[2:15:18] Wootzu: @venruki nice looking mog
[2:15:18] chaps_86: @isseswagger no
[2:15:20] Hark0n: just M+ trash PVE
[2:15:36] dakila24: when are we getting outlaw?
[2:15:43] Darkleo28: So maybe make them a little tangier? They're in such a awkward spot I feel like rofl
[2:15:48] LoveStruck27: just try going for an oldschool comp like RMP and zug zug  all in 1 min or lose
[2:15:48] Darkleo28: Tankier*
[2:15:55] soddi: have you ever tried hunter?
[2:15:55] Blitzylive: why did Frog switch team make up when facing The Move? they beat them with mage and suddenly changed comp for their 2nd round
[2:15:57] LoveStruck27: thats the only way you can have fun as mage in 3v3
[2:15:59] Jun_bug__: 1844 on my hpal atm so close to 2k lol
[2:16:05] LoveStruck27: thats what i  do rn, and its somewhat fun to play
[2:16:08] LoveStruck27: but lose a lot
[2:16:15] Mozaiczny: Warlock is like turret for me. I need something more mobile, dev or mage?
[2:16:17] chaps_86: @soddi ive been telling him to play survival for a while =P
[2:16:20] gelatokush: i made a void elf sp 2 days ago i like it

[2:19:39] LoveStruck27: damn, using LoS tactics, unthinkable Kappa
[2:19:40] IIyena: buff uptime
[2:19:46] Badasti: my favourite when im healing is when i grip someone to a pillar and they run straight back out and die immediately
[2:19:48] danger_daft: @vortex071232 not keeping up the correct buffs, not pressing things at the correct time
[2:19:50] Jun_bug__: Crits or non procs
[2:19:51] vortex071232: i need to press role the bones more?
[2:19:56] LoveStruck27: complains aboout no caster loby , meets 3 in 1 game LUL

[2:22:35] vortex071232: it feels really low
[2:23:01] Jun_bug__: did you have shark buff?
[2:23:35] vortex071232: no but is it not supposed to crit for more than 85k top with 7 crits total?
[2:24:19] Jun_bug__: not sure tbh havnt really played mine
[2:24:28] Jun_bug__: ggs all g2g
[2:24:29] vortex071232: it just feels weird seeing his dps 300k and mine 100k
[2:24:52] pulsch: Hey Ven. I really thought the AWC matches this weekend were some of the best I have seen ever. So entertaining! What did you think?
[2:24:58] Hark0n: ret had no CDS

[2:36:00] scubaclay: I saw thirsty seconds to mars (this song) wildy good singer :)

[2:37:59] LoveStruck27: asking for general playstyle
[2:38:14] knucklesthedruid: @LoveStruck27 yes... you want people to play aggro as prevoke
[2:38:24] exxpaa: boomy position is horrrrrible

[2:39:06] dailyshuffle: yoo ven, i made a new daily shuffle episode feat. a new weird pvp bug, ppl losing -150 points out of nowhere...
[2:39:08] 13phx: @venruki last week on your stream you watched Bicmex's team get destroyed by a mw/arms/ret team called Fist Hard Or Go Home... i cannot find any record of that team anywhere now... is there a reason for that?
[2:39:08] dipicat: ive been spam fighting fws today and last night
[2:39:14] dipicat: didnt realize that many people watched awc

[2:39:38] dipicat: @petkicklol real
[2:39:40] peterbien: Ven, bring me to Canada
[2:39:43] peterbien: kkkkk
[2:39:43] shugguls: @dailyshuffle is it up?
[2:39:50] Darkleo28: Are queue times any better or as abysmal as ever?
[2:40:18] foxyllama: how do u like ur new caster?
[2:40:19] dailyshuffle: @shugguls yea i uploaded it some minutes ago
[2:40:46] Ractz: YOOO
[2:40:46] shugguls: @dailyshuffle nice i look forward to these
[2:40:47] LoveStruck27: avoiding my question, sadge
[2:40:52] poroyou: lol everyone going against MW - "Is this a fistweaver" ?
[2:41:36] Judgejobrown: "moystweaver" LUL
[2:42:06] Hyper009: @LoveStruck27 i mean he was just talking about that for an extended period of time before the last match
[2:42:37] zachgamegodx: unless there's a ret and/or warrior in the lobby u can beat a fw with silence ontop of a stun pretty easy
[2:42:44] LoveStruck27: @Hyper009 on what they could change for mage? not really, i was here LOL
[2:43:03] LoveStruck27: i know the current problems that they have in playstyle, he spoke about that, and i totally agree
[2:43:05] gdodmebxu: Pog
[2:43:14] infam0us0303: was that kb a 400k sun kick?!
[2:43:25] infam0us0303: ahh
[2:43:32] foxyllama: does anyone know what the engineering missives are called?
[2:43:42] gdodmebxu: buff dmg remove ring of fire
[2:43:48] ATHLTE: @foxyllama meticulous
[2:43:55] foxyllama: @ATHLTE ty
[2:44:00] ATHLTE: @foxyllama that might be mastery tho
[2:44:02] mvpala_tv: agree
[2:44:13] zachgamegodx: games just slow paced atm
[2:44:13] mvpala_tv: less micro cc more meaningful damage
[2:44:16] driftwood_tc: I miss the days when feral was about pressure and dot, and not just big burst squishy shit
[2:44:24] zachgamegodx: most specs have that issue besides demon hunter and ww
[2:44:27] codey_____: hey ven, what is the most fun pvp class in your opinion?
[2:44:33] danger_daft: only "finish" mages have is Scorch "Execute"
[2:44:56] gdodmebxu: arcane barrage executes too
[2:45:03] What_ln_Tarnation: :(
[2:45:06] danger_daft: with searing torch, of course not a real execute but still
[2:45:07] LoveStruck27: like bring back deep freeze and a burst potential with non casts so at least you have some pressure would be nice
[2:45:14] gdodmebxu: i don't like having to rely on ring of fire pad to do dmg
[2:45:18] What_ln_Tarnation: ive been seeing tons of ass rogs in SS lately, they good now or what
[2:45:33] ferahgok: @driftwood_tc On the contrary, I love the big bites and burst. And I don't mind the squishiness either - it's just that we used to have self heals to counteract the damage a bit and now we don't.

[3:15:26] maybethistimepls: youre 10000% correct
[3:15:38] AstralScare: yeah specially if you are playing a fistweaver vs one :D KEKW
[3:15:44] 인터넷포트: Cyclone should be insant cast and have a 40 second cooldown. Remove spammable CC it ruins the game in my opinion
[3:15:47] Nikademous: Who wonnered?
[3:15:49] K3tchup_33: its usually the only thing they can kick
[3:15:52] Badasti: clone should be dispellable though

[3:16:48] karijes4: Venruki thanks for the kind words you had towards my team Lava Lava these cups.

[3:17:11] karijes4: Much love!
[3:17:25] 인터넷포트: @heymomimonttv Not it doesnt' thats literally better for the other teams because u cant get cloned 3 times into a dr stun with 90% dampening

[3:18:08] bitcoinonlyfans: DH did the same thing every game
[3:18:09] goesidd: u need to rewind further
[3:18:09] driftwood_tc: look at his turning
[3:18:11] wackpoetic: he would mount up and wait at spawn in starting room, then run out as soon as gates open
[3:18:13] baxter5569: but it wasnt actual trill.
[3:18:16] KrimzinGames: after gates open he runs the same path
[3:18:26] dpg6969: he doesnt use the spell where he can see the rogue and druid
[3:18:30] heymomimonttv: @인터넷포트 CD on clone sounds good, insta cast undispellable cc does not sound good. i agree, clone is way too oppressive but i dont think making it an instant is the answer
[3:18:30] popzirl: nah trills dh is trilldh
[3:18:37] orcrimmar: why was their healer banned?
[3:18:43] Airitreya: who got banned?

[3:34:27] dakila24: lol why does mage feel like even if i outplay the enemy team by a huge factor i still can't kill anything ugh

[3:37:09] Hobblefoot: Okay DUMB question.  Don't you have to be standing in the ring of fire for it to do damage?
[3:37:18] VanrakeTV: @venruki I quit start of S2 when the MMR was scuffed. Did they ever fix it?
[3:37:24] kusoneko: Kaze means "Wind", no means "of", Kage means "Shadow", so it means like Wind of Shadow or Shadow's Wind
[3:37:40] Spaceberry_McDuck: watching sam made me wonder if he presses cyclone more than any other button. all those fake casts, lol
[3:37:43] Hobblefoot: Well shit.  I have been screwing that up royally.

[3:45:41] Hobblefoot: @venruki I am not sure who the new caster was with you guys but really complimented you, Supa and Ziqo. Would be a good perm addition.
[3:45:42] thisisthotcaller: to be fair, i thought ziqo and liyth (spelling?) were also killing it
[3:45:43] squarepusher_: Big props to Lythi also

[3:47:43] Hobblefoot: *the
[3:47:46] Ackisen: we need feral defensive buffs if anything
[3:47:47] Blitzylive: mana is just cosmetic
[3:47:49] Falcanus: ill accept a mana nerf if they nerf druids trees
[3:47:53] Toonahz: THE TUNA IS THRISTY
[3:47:56] lifeproof: they need  to nerf druid trents this brain death boring trent spec
[3:48:01] Hobblefoot: @Ackisen Agreed.  Not a lot but  geez they fall over.
[3:48:15] kusoneko: how many times did he get canned
[3:48:17] wreklol: @IIyena agreed. it's just a nerf rdru at this point. and honestly just nerf their mana. make the skill cap drink related. it's not hard but it could be the limiting factor
[3:48:17] Kujo_XX: 'bluefin tuna'

[3:48:42] checkemcharles: i heard it and i cringed and got cancer
[3:48:42] Toonahz: had to send it
[3:48:46] Ackisen: @Hobblefoot yeah its insane, 2200 mmr and i cant survive anything, literally dying through bearform SI and barkskin alot of games
[3:48:51] ThePdfreak: im gonna be honest its not that funny to me
[3:48:57] ObbTheKnob: not pretending, was genuinly a good joke
[3:49:04] IIyena: buff feral

[3:49:39] Locturnal_TV: lets get aug back in the meta
[3:49:42] Kujo_XX: I actually preferred your calmer commentary vs the auctioneer style of others just dripping with bad situational jokes.
[3:49:44] imitatewater: its insane how everyone says rdruid is insane when rsham is also insane
[3:49:44] Smexxin: whats the venruki wishlist for changes

[3:51:18] jayyArrington: enhance def bufff
[3:51:18] Hark0n: enhancement 󠀀
[3:51:18] fellan92: HOLY PALA
[3:51:19] IIyena: feral the most imo outside of frost dk
[3:51:23] SweatyDaniels: hunter needs a whole ass rework
[3:51:29] wackpoetic: Biggest Nerf and Buff in one: Nerf Cyclone and Buff Feral (giga-buff to compensate)
[3:51:30] heymomimonttv: ele/enh dont need buffs/nerfs- they need a full ass rework
[3:51:38] fredscoop: FACTS
[3:51:39] nexottv: mouch class need rework not buffs
[3:51:40] IIyena: fair
[3:51:42] Falcanus: agree
[3:51:43] Brotali1ty: enhance shaman!!!
[3:51:43] Badasti: I think feral needs a rework

[3:51:47] yesterday_potato: sure agree
[3:51:47] drfeltgood: TRUE
[3:51:47] WhereMaldo: agreed
[3:51:47] blueblrrrd: fair
[3:51:48] kromg: agreed, elly and enhance need a rework so bad
[3:51:49] PuffnTuff: True
[3:51:49] 333silas333: agree
[3:51:50] Darkleo28: I don't think hunter needs damage buffs more survivability tbh.
[3:51:53] ferahgok: Fine by me, but if you nerf cyclone they need something
[3:52:02] Ackisen: problem with nerfing cyclone for feral, is the fact ur entire 4pc and only viable honor talent revolves around landing cyclones
[3:52:04] prayful_x: yeah thats true
[3:52:15] drfeltgood: enhance
[3:52:16] prayful_x: cyclone is insane
[3:52:16] lundbergmackan: enhance sham
[3:52:19] Brotali1ty: enhance sham needs something
[3:52:22] jayyArrington: enhance survivalbility
[3:52:23] heymomimonttv: ven - how do you feel about ele/enh rework? not buff/nerf, entire rework
[3:52:25] clymr: Genuine question, how would you fix cyclone?
[3:52:26] SlyMooseMan: Even if they just reduced it by a second for every DR
[3:52:28] wackpoetic: Ye, Cyclone -> 5 Seconds, and make Feral tanky in bear Form. They're already looking at tankiness of a bunch of specs with the armor changes; why not change Feral Bear?
[3:52:30] FateIRL: tbh ferals need to cyclone in cat form
[3:52:31] Haretic: we dont
[3:52:35] stealthwalker99: enh needs glass cannon talent like a fire mage
[3:52:39] Badasti: rework feral, give mage MS effect, make clone dispellable, lower melee mobility and make casters cast more
[3:52:39] braindeadjoseki: frost dk
[3:52:42] Badasti: remove precog
[3:52:45] soddi: maybe polymorph shouldn't break on aoe dmg, which would bring it back up again to the ranks of cyclone
[3:52:46] Lamatastisch: not a dmg buff but maybe DK in general needs something for physical dmg reduce. I want to see mes in AWC Sadge
[3:52:46] Ackisen: no one liks being forced into a gimmy honor talent to be viable
[3:52:52] Falcanus: to be fair though, the game is the most balanced its been, can you recall another awc where there was so much comp diversity
[3:52:56] Darkleo28: Maybe fury warrior could use more surv and utility? Not sure if they need more damage either
[3:53:02] Texdizzle: all addons and weak auras removed
[3:53:02] sixthycent: sterge! when you goin live dude omg
[3:53:06] nikthevoker: devoker needs range
[3:53:07] ram13ll: Demo lock needs a burst window!
[3:53:11] FelQueen: Blizzard should give Feral an instant Cyclone cast proc after 5 combo and it will be balanced, I swear TakeNRG
[3:53:14] FateIRL: you have to play glass cannon to do normal damage now. glass cannon sucks
[3:53:15] heymomimonttv: CD on some rogue cc's, like kidney/cheap
[3:53:24] IIyena: make dh squishier
[3:53:33] cyborg1141: Prot Pali pvp buff
[3:53:52] SirBeaverTeeth: wouldn't it just help to increase fire mage damage at this point?
[3:53:53] srslysnek: a few small tweaks go a long way, but a few classes just need their playstyle completely changed in some way (feral, fdk, etc)
[3:53:53] kusoneko: hpal needs a bit of love tbh
[3:53:56] LunacySP: make astral shift og shamanistic rage for enhance
[3:54:10] bruce_t_wayne: are we sure dh is balanced? because it sure doesn‘t feel like it is
[3:54:11] bigpumperrz: demonhunter needs buff :P
[3:54:14] blueblrrrd: buff the npcs giving audio before the gates open
[3:54:14] tritonxlol: hpal is very good rn
[3:54:16] lingonsaft: Aug needs love
[3:54:23] chaps_86: @bruce_t_wayne not even close
[3:54:24] Darkleo28: Health might be fine but shaman ans druids kinda outperform atm
[3:54:29] stealthwalker99: fw deleted
[3:54:30] IIyena: just make dh more squishy tbh. make them kite more which in return reduces pressure
[3:54:30] Darkleo28: Hpala*
[3:54:34] KhAoTiCFeeLeY: Assas rogue needs buffs
[3:54:36] Mckriminal: anyone here that thinks outlaw is a little too annoying :p ?
[3:54:38] chaps_86: I said it earlier, but dh will still be s tier with a 15% dmg nerf
[3:54:44] sixthycent: think hpalas could use a tad boost or bring back
[3:54:44] Cocoapuffs1: hpal shouldnt revolve around critting so much
[3:54:46] ram13ll: DEMO lock needs a burst window ! :D
[3:54:48] sixthycent: 30% on sacrifice
[3:54:51] tritonxlol: fw sucks in a random lobby for the most part. only good with retwar
[3:54:54] drfeltgood: @cyborg1141 u disgust me
[3:54:54] Cocoapuffs1: if you dont crit on hpal you just lose
[3:54:56] blueblrrrd: demo lock needs a shield nerf
[3:54:57] tmh1995: and only being viable with a ret is already a big nerf to a spec
[3:54:58] leeka: i do!
[3:55:02] srslysnek: buff mw mana?
[3:55:03] bruce_t_wayne: @chaps_86 ok thats good to know

[3:55:16] Vizour: hows affliction atm?
[3:55:18] pookzys: were any hunters played in either week yet?
[3:55:19] absterge: fistweave r is so sick I love it I love fighting a healer that gets out of all CC from their team and runs me down just kicking my face I.
[3:55:27] leeka: @absterge lololol
[3:55:29] Reiumi_: true POOGERS
[3:55:31] chaps_86: @pookzys bicmex of course..
[3:55:35] Reiumi_: KEKW
[3:55:49] pookzys: was he in top 8?
[3:55:52] pookzys: didnt see any
[3:55:52] ThePdfreak: you are part of the problem
[3:55:54] tritonxlol: @absterge u still sad about the other night when we ran over wiz and u died without bark
[3:55:54] absterge: I have 1. I don’t play it ever
[3:55:57] blueblrrrd: because he has too lol
[3:55:57] absterge: ur frying me
[3:55:58] vanlonja: Demo needs a tank treatment for arena. No one wants to see 20 fucking minions dancing around blocking the screen.
[3:56:10] pookzys: meant hunters, not absterge lol
[3:56:11] absterge: LOL
[3:56:12] vmills: @absterge check the tapes
[3:56:17] reazer125: were there any hunters in awc?
[3:56:26] sixthycent: easy ven he aint streamed in 2 days, like killing me sir
[3:56:30] stealthwalker99: In shuffle fw hard counters some classes because of the aoe heal. Or if it's all melee with very little cc the other healer gets 6-0 almost every time
[3:56:31] chaps_86: no, bicmex didnt make top 8
[3:56:34] drfeltgood: take prot paladin out for healer spot in SS
[3:56:35] stealthwalker99: it's just an abomination
[3:56:48] vmills: buff them all
[3:56:51] Mckriminal: @venruki  why did dk get nerfed before dh?
[3:56:53] blueblrrrd: yea remove tank as an option in solo shuffle
[3:56:58] krisdahaka: it's them, who did it the first place tho
[3:57:06] tritonxlol: bring back lowiebowie @absterge
[3:57:06] krisdahaka: 50 spells on every class
[3:57:09] Cocoapuffs1: just gut it like they did hpal melee wings
[3:57:10] Falcanus: u have to at least say ret nerfs to keep up your image as the villain of the ret community
[3:57:10] krisdahaka: how can u balance it?
[3:57:17] sourbutts: definitely not balancing for 2s
[3:57:18] Zenlyn: i think for shuffle coz of popularity
[3:57:19] heymomimonttv: hmmm ven, maybe start ur list based on what you saw in awc this weekend. what did you see this weekend that definitely needs buffed/nerfed?
[3:57:24] novokaine47: Seflishly hope they balance solo shuffle
[3:57:31] Cocoapuffs1: fist shouldnt be viable in pvp
[3:57:34] drfeltgood: buff the pvp dev tam
[3:57:34] sourbutts: have specific buffs/nerfs for 2s/3s/solo
[3:57:38] Spawrro: for gods sake just balance it!
[3:57:38] Reiumi_: pepeD
[3:57:44] Voriq: rogue
[3:57:46] Mckriminal: dh
[3:57:47] IIyena: destro dh outlaw
[3:57:47] fredscoop: outlaw
[3:57:48] smitesucks: dh tattoos nerf, and fix blur outlaw cdr reduced,  do something about arcane mage dispel spam
[3:57:49] Reiumi_: pepoG
[3:57:50] Haretic: lol
[3:57:54] heymomimonttv: arcane lol
[3:57:57] kusoneko: sub
[3:58:00] AstralScare: ELE
[3:58:01] Falcanus: arcane
[3:58:02] Mckriminal: dragon dps
[3:58:03] jayyArrington: windwalker
[3:58:06] vmills: I think everyone would be happy if they just balance around what every individual person likes to play lolol
[3:58:09] IIyena: no more sp buffs pls. playstyle is mega aids tho
[3:58:14] Zenlyn: u could argue holy priest cos its so represented rn but i think for ladder play its less so? but ofc im biased
[3:58:15] fatulina: deva need some change too, is so quishi
[3:58:16] Falcanus: fisters
[3:58:18] heymomimonttv: DH, outlaw, fw
[3:58:18] fatulina: squishi
[3:58:19] Kujo_XX: Comprehensive balance is elusive, but they have the data to address outliers and it's the outliers that are the most detrimental.   It's their delays in reeling the outliers in that is problematic.  Iterate, monitor. Rinse, repeat.
[3:58:19] AstralScare: ele shaman
[3:58:22] guesswhofoo: had to open on the web browser to mitigate ad break
[3:58:22] wackpoetic: Boomkin (because Cyclone)
[3:58:23] nikthevoker: evoker needs rework
[3:58:24] guesswhofoo: we back
[3:58:25] Voriq: Give SPriest orbs back
[3:58:28] veltrinor: rogue as a class is toxic
[3:58:32] bruce_t_wayne: can you specify toxic?
[3:58:39] heymomimonttv: dh, outlaw, fw, cyclone - all toxic lol
[3:58:53] vmills: buff hpriest!!
[3:58:55] chaps_86: take as little dmg as possible
[3:59:14] vmills: scrap cyclone all together!!
[3:59:16] fatulina: buff sp ?
[3:59:28] petkicklol: fw is the same thing just hard counters certain specs
[3:59:33] LoveStruck27: kleptomania Kappa
[3:59:34] petkicklol: 100% falls under that category
[3:59:34] IIyena: just give sp damnation back
[3:59:50] kusoneko: buff afflic or nah?
[3:59:55] heymomimonttv: DH def toxic and needs changes
[3:59:56] yesterday_potato: did they say they were making changes?
[4:00:01] stealthwalker99: fw doesn’t need changes it needs the aug treatment
[4:00:09] LoveStruck27: note it down on calendar
[4:00:25] Mozaiczny: Guys, Ele or Mage for PvP? I am melee main., wanna go caster
[4:00:27] srslysnek: @IIyena please and thank you
[4:00:31] jamesip87: DH 6-0

[4:00:34] Rofyx: warrior 0-6 prediction fr fr
[4:00:36] LoveStruck27: dear diary, got 1 caster today Kappa
[4:00:39] petkicklol: @stealthwalker99 accurate
[4:00:52] Darkleo28: The only true way to balance everything if make everything the same with no variety. But when variety is involved its very difficult to balance everything
[4:00:56] Rafheeki: warriors need a buff
[4:01:03] vmills: destro is crazy right now but I would never say nerf a class like destro
[4:01:03] ram13ll: I cant believe I reached 1800 on my demo having to play against ppl like you
[4:01:10] chaps_86: oof
[4:01:10] fatulina: lol
[4:01:10] Voriq: LOL WTF

[4:02:06] petkicklol: what mmr is this lob
[4:02:12] kusoneko: what a son of a gun
[4:02:51] heymomimonttv: one time i saw yellowcard perform and i was the only person in the crowd. technically it was soundcheck tho LMAO
[4:02:52] Moobot: YouTube channel: youtube.com/venruki * Subscribe for new content!
[4:03:35] AstralScare: u dont
[4:03:55] fatulina: 0-6 lock angle
[4:04:14] Saitistreamy: 2k isnt low
[4:04:23] ferahgok: shots fired
[4:04:30] ram13ll: why are you against LOCKS hehe? :D
[4:04:31] Kujo_XX: 'low' as I struggle to break 1600
[4:04:51] Saitistreamy: 2.1 is top 6% in Soloshuffle
[4:05:40] rvdsupremas: hee ven u were talking bout class list
[4:05:44] rvdsupremas: new video on youtube soon?
[4:05:54] gaulois62: 2.1 should not be 6% lol
[4:05:57] rvdsupremas: always watch your videos
[4:06:03] chaps_86: @Saitistreamy really?
[4:06:06] Kujo_XX: Outliers, focus on the outliers
[4:06:15] Saitistreamy: @chaps_86 yup according to drustvar rating distribution for SS
[4:06:17] wEiRdO_dUdE: snupyFERAL snupyFERAL snupyFERAL
[4:06:17] capoalexo: I've seen DH in every solo shuffle
[4:06:33] Saitistreamy: @chaps_86 so most likely its actually smaller then 6%
[4:06:48] chaps_86: Interesting
[4:07:02] volbyz: @Saitistreamy drustvar also only can count the ladder above 1k CR- its 6% of all players >1k cr to be considered "rated". not 6% of the playerbase
[4:07:28] Pyraclese: what healer do you think has the highest number of "good lobbies"?
[4:07:35] chaps_86: rdruid
[4:07:38] chaps_86: for sure
[4:07:44] chaps_86: mana isnt an issue in shuffle
[4:07:45] Saitistreamy: @volbyz correct so it is potentially 3% or if you think whole player base, more like 0.3%
[4:07:45] stealthwalker99: Take a look at all the stats on drustvar
[4:07:46] chaps_86: for rrdruid
[4:08:01] Sheepyou: @Pyraclese druid
[4:08:10] drfeltgood: @venruki do you still have your original monk?
[4:08:31] volbyz: @Saitistreamy which to be entirely fair, is roughly what duelist has been in the years past. Duelist cutoff for titles was top 3% of the battlegroup.
[4:08:40] heymomimonttv: @volbyz do you have the % for 1800?
[4:08:49] zachgamegodx: i thought the point of this monk was to q both for more qs
[4:08:56] drfeltgood: the only way to climb in SS is to be good enough to carry the entire 6 games. IMO
[4:09:07] heymomimonttv: @drfeltgood feels like that sometimes tbh
[4:10:11] Punkfx: Been a few months since I've played. Are Q times still really high for SS?
[4:10:23] chaps_86: @Punkfx not for healers =D
[4:10:43] chaps_86: @Punkfx my survival ques last night were 15 minutes @ 2100 cr
[4:10:55] Kujo_XX: @Punkfx Can be, I had an instant and a 30 minuter last night. I'd say average is 12-15 mins.
[4:10:57] guesswhofoo: random comps , no comms, random teammates dring ccs, queue wait times 30 mins. you can spend 1.5 hrs and get 3 lobbies of 3-3 and gain 0 cr. it’s the perfect blizzard design for engagement and wasting your time.
[4:11:00] Punkfx: Good to know - ty!
[4:11:03] Lugges48: im so clueless on monk. do you try to do 3 kiefer gos a min on everyone or just train one guy mostly? or do you build with alphatiger first and than do a fat go with the haste?
[4:11:05] soddi: the mobility kit of ww is so much fun xD
[4:11:11] AstralScare: have u ever played hunter ven
[4:11:23] drfeltgood: @punkfx depends on what spec u play, least played = lower Q times
[4:11:37] soddi: reconnect in .1s, holy mother of nasa pc oO
[4:11:38] driftwood_tc: touch of death on scroll wheel so good btw
[4:11:41] Dancedizzler: ven i wanna do some mm ww healer at high rating ... its gotta be big dam
[4:12:07] Sheepyou: just bind touch of dead to every  spell LUL
[4:12:31] soddi: the wl is scared out of his mind
[4:12:39] Garthd: Gz on the big raiting!
[4:12:44] drfeltgood: @sheepyou does that work???
[4:13:00] heymomimonttv: have you ever play survival hunter tho?
[4:13:02] Sheepyou: @drfeltgood should work maybe ven know more

[4:14:17] Slunkss: what’s up buddddyyyy
[4:14:24] heymomimonttv: i geared my warrior solely in solos to see how long it would take, less than a work week. still alot of time in queues tho and 2s is still def fastest
[4:14:48] imRyanxo: @heymomimonttv ty
[4:15:06] heymomimonttv: pretty handsome awkward :D banger song
[4:15:06] Nickystr1x: @drfeltgood unless im mistaken you cant macro 2 on-gcd spells together
[4:15:59] Sheepyou: @Nickystr1x dunno but ToD is anyways greyed out so u cant use it until opponent is <10%
[4:16:15] Sheepyou: so u cant even use it /press it
[4:16:39] chaps_86: I kind of miss the BFA touch of death.

[4:18:05] chaps_86: i wish the buffed atonement healing on disc'
[4:18:09] Slunkss: FW is actually the most unrepresented rn, no?
[4:18:17] vegetibilis: veng needs buffs but you can get 2200 with it rn in any bracket honestly 2v2 is  tough since its all tank dps all the way
[4:18:18] dailyshuffle: enhance maybe?
[4:18:23] WardenDOTA: aff needs changes Sadge

[4:20:20] WardenDOTA: i would consider hpal toxic if they are good tho. just so many immunities and externals they are way different from other healers
[4:20:26] Peacetreaty4: mind blast hits for about the same as a tick of penance
[4:20:30] PunishedLrnz: disc becomes a healbot
[4:20:32] PunishedLrnz: yeah
[4:20:35] chaps_86: you can spec into dmg for disc, but you lose so much healing
[4:20:37] marvin1995xo: why is feral toxic ?
[4:20:39] AstralScare: yeah because atonment heals for 0
[4:20:39] baxter5569: should put hunter on the list for needs help. not dmg, but survivability or sustain.
[4:20:41] chaps_86: unviable for 3s
[4:20:54] AstralScare: @baxter5569 true
[4:20:57] LoveStruck27: @chaps_86 even if you go damage as disc you do less than a holy priest
[4:20:58] shugguls: fury needs help
[4:20:59] Haretic: cyclone spam is boring
[4:21:04] WardenDOTA: !Holzkern
[4:21:06] Nightbot: Need a gift for your loved ones for Valentine's Day? Check out Holzkern and make sure to use my code VENRUKI15 for 15% off! http://www.holzkern.com/venruki
[4:21:16] chaps_86: @LoveStruck27 nah, full send disc in 2s outdamages rogues
[4:21:22] chaps_86: watch Hemmis play disc
[4:21:29] doclovejr: i see no hunters on this list
[4:21:34] chaps_86: thats my point
[4:21:37] ryanblue98: Buff tanks Kappa
[4:21:37] LoveStruck27: @chaps_86 we're talking overall or just 2v2s?
[4:21:38] Peacetreaty4: went from rmp being a glad push comp for us into priest ooming every game with new damp meta. they lose the drink war every time it feels like
[4:21:39] Darkleo28: What do you think makes cyclone less toxic? Make it dispellable? Or reduce the duration by 1 sec?
[4:21:42] Cocoapuffs1: Bm should be in needing changes. Hunters need more defensively
[4:21:46] kusoneko: instantly puts down mages for "needs help" LUL
[4:21:49] ATHLTE: what about caster mw
[4:21:50] B0ost3d: bliz needs to care about more than just 3s
[4:21:50] marvin1995xo: hunter are the most toxic specs
[4:21:51] mayonaes: what about DEMO?
[4:21:51] VanrakeTV: Ele?
[4:21:52] 2pikula: would you rather play ele or spriest in arena in general
[4:21:56] WardenDOTA: bm hunter is toxic, survival needs help, mm is toxic and needs help
[4:22:02] Judgejobrown: ele == toxic
[4:22:07] pozzzgg: unholy dk?
[4:22:08] fredscoop: theyre strong af unspellable frost trap is crazy
[4:22:09] jontepman: but Holy does more dmg because it doesn’t heal so it’s more rewarding
[4:22:13] LoveStruck27: @2pikula ele seems easier than spriest tbh
[4:22:15] Darthrando: bowl serves 10
[4:22:16] mayonaes: Demo is toxic and Aff needs help
[4:22:17] chaps_86: @LoveStruck27 my point was full dmg spec is unviable in 3s / shuffle.
[4:22:18] heymomimonttv: ele and enh both need entire reworks
[4:22:30] baxter5569: hunters can probably take a dps nerf if they get some survival or sustain. :( just seeing a DK heal all their health back 3 times doesnt matter how much u can kite them. you will die
[4:22:31] IronlakPat: dh defensives too good
[4:22:31] Borngood: also freedom and bop not removing debuffs was a huge undocumented change
[4:22:34] tinkertowns: enh needs love
[4:22:37] Machine1312: holy pala needs help surely?
[4:22:42] sixthycent: think sp could use a mind blast buff
[4:22:44] mahz: You guys every make like toasted bread for your soups?
[4:22:45] shugguls: ele definitely toxic , caster that doesn’t cast
[4:22:48] LoveStruck27: @chaps_86 i play full dps disc in solo, its bad, i play holy and i do more damage and heals are much better...
[4:22:48] sixthycent: and
[4:22:49] Borngood: slows
[4:22:49] theronpaul: like hamstring
[4:22:49] ferahgok: @WardenDOTA Oh man, I abhor BM hunters jumping around, pressing 2 buttons, not landing traps, and just winning on pressure
[4:22:51] IIyena: fix dh blur bug and reduce magic mitigation
[4:22:52] goozei: at what rating does this changes needed? or just overall?
[4:22:54] reedthesham: what about my enhancement shamans :(
[4:23:03] reedthesham: also, good afternoon
[4:23:04] reedthesham: <3
[4:23:05] theronpaul: hamstring goes through freed now just doesnt slow till freed is over
[4:23:09] fredscoop: hunter can also feign UA no dmg
[4:23:11] Borngood: if freedom gets purged they instantly get reslowed
[4:23:12] chaps_86: @LoveStruck27 yep, unviable in 3s/shuff
[4:23:13] Borngood: it's bullshit
[4:23:13] ryanblue98: MW needs help
[4:23:16] sourbutts: make frost bomb undispellable, frost mage fixed hahah
[4:23:22] WardenDOTA: there's a talent that makes it remove debuffs right
[4:23:24] Pexxal: !song
[4:23:25] Nightbot: Enable the AHA Music Identifier to find out the song! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aha-music-music-identifie/dpacanjfikmhoddligfbehkpomnbgblf?hl=en
[4:23:25] zachgamegodx: 10.2
[4:23:27] Drakkur: MM is pretty bad an needs significant changes to make it work. Surv could use more survivability
[4:23:40] zachgamegodx: doesnt clear hammy either
[4:23:41] Moobot: rukiCool rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy realshadynasty WELCOME TO THE BUDDY CLUB! rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiBuddy rukiCool
[4:23:43] FelQueen: The mobility of the monk, rogue, DH and mage should be nerfed so that the warrior can do any damage PixelBob
[4:23:47] sourbutts: or let casters run while casting would fix it
[4:23:56] hamsti: MM is so 1 shotty
[4:24:07] Drakkur: I agree it needs a full rework to shift its damage from physical to magic
[4:24:13] zachgamegodx: 1 shoty is fine, too many dampeners rn @hamsti
[4:24:27] WardenDOTA: MrDestructoid
[4:24:38] Blitzylive: isnt Jamie the botter?
[4:24:39] theronpaul: ^ one shotty meta best meta
[4:24:43] theronpaul: us hpals will reign
[4:25:01] baxter5569: should have a pvp talent for MM hunter that lets you cast Aimed shot on the move but you deal 25% less dmg with it
[4:25:09] Reiumi_: im starting to play pres. it was awkward at first but I think I got it.
[4:25:19] ryanblue98: caster monks no damage
[4:25:21] Telarius1: does melee wings still exist
[4:25:22] ThePdfreak: big dam judge for 2k
[4:25:23] Telarius1: for hpal
[4:25:32] sixthycent: hpals neeed a 2-3 perc healing or increase sac bakc to 30% dam reduction
[4:25:34] hamsti: ya but you don't really play it @Telarius1
[4:25:38] sixthycent: make judgement hit harder
[4:25:38] Reiumi_: nah
[4:25:48] wEiRdO_dUdE: If resto shaman can launch 120K lava bursts, hpal should be able to do some kind of damage, true
[4:25:53] hamsti: It also doesn't really make you do "good damage" KEKW
[4:25:53] BludlockFS: they nerfed melee wings really hard in like s1
[4:25:53] Telarius1: has anyone invsted in it enough to know if its good or not
[4:25:54] sixthycent: saw what 1 hpal in all of awc
[4:26:04] WardenDOTA: 75k
[4:26:04] hamsti: 100k
[4:26:05] Borngood: should be the hardest hitting ability in ur kit
[4:26:06] dmay93: 125k
[4:26:07] Garthd: 120K
[4:26:08] Borngood: does nothing
[4:26:09] sadccookie: 40k
[4:26:10] skyestormz: 80k
[4:26:11] Telarius1: not 100k lol
[4:26:12] Blitzylive: 150k
[4:26:13] Cocoapuffs1: Fistweave needs same treatment melee wings got
[4:26:13] sixthycent: maybe 60-80k if it crits
[4:26:14] heymomimonttv: i thought judge 1 shotted? according to the mies
[4:26:14] theronpaul: 250k for sure
[4:26:15] IIyena: 80k
[4:26:16] sixthycent: it cost mana
[4:26:16] Sheepyou: 50-80k
[4:26:16] kusoneko: 100k, just like lavaburst
[4:26:17] B0ost3d: % health lol
[4:26:18] Reiumi_: 75k
[4:26:18] restosoup28: 89-90k
[4:26:20] nameyourform: it should hit= Big dam judge
[4:26:20] Darkleo28: Half of lava burst
[4:26:22] Telarius1: Rshams have to cast 90 lava bursts.
[4:26:22] Voriq: 80k
[4:26:22] reedthesham: 75k max
[4:26:25] ThePdfreak: 50k non crit
[4:26:26] restosoup28: like a lava burst
[4:26:26] Telarius1: For 90k
[4:26:28] dmay93: lava burst hits for that much!
[4:26:28] Blitzylive: 80k reg 150k crit
[4:26:28] Borngood: lava burst procs do what, 140k?
[4:26:29] restosoup28: on rsham
[4:26:29] AstralScare: u never press it
[4:26:33] Telarius1: Why would judgement, instant cast, ranged, do more lol
[4:26:33] hamsti: Lavaburst can be an instant proc and you can spam it
[4:26:35] Phreshbrew: when cast by the mies, judgement should instantly kill
[4:26:36] reedthesham: @Borngood 120ish and above yah
[4:26:37] dmay93: and lava burst has no cooldown
[4:26:37] fredscoop: theres only 4 dmg abilities though... should be that high... has a cooldown as welll
[4:26:37] Darkleo28: I'm thinking 60 to 70k
[4:26:38] hamsti: i don't see how 100k is that crazy
[4:26:39] GLYFEnation: 60k judge
[4:26:46] BludlockFS: just make it percentage based 6% of max hp
[4:26:54] Telarius1: And judgement low cd
[4:27:00] dmay93: how much does RSK hit for
[4:27:02] Darkleo28: It's instant whereas lava burst is casted
[4:27:04] guesswhofoo: divine toll would solo people
[4:27:08] kusoneko: judge used to do damage, and that was fun. now it doesnt do damage, and thats not fun.
[4:27:08] guesswhofoo: how
[4:27:08] Borngood: all I know a number above 20k is a no brainer but im bias I guess
[4:27:12] driftwood_tc: doesnt DH death sweep (3hits) do a total of 280k in awc?
[4:27:16] Telarius1: it should be like 60-70k
[4:27:19] Telarius1: non crit
[4:27:38] hamsti: how much should holy shock hit for?
[4:27:46] vmills: but what about when you use divine toll?
[4:27:51] vmills: that would be a lot
[4:27:52] phanabananana: idk i kinda like it how it is, perfect enough for crusader to think he can kill people but he cant
[4:27:53] ThePdfreak: would be like a 130 k crit
[4:27:54] hamsti: divine toll does holy shocks @vmills
[4:27:59] hamsti: not judgments for holy
[4:28:00] ThePdfreak: seems a bit on the high side
[4:28:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: DH's death sweep is a ton of damage yeah, it can be their #2
[4:28:06] vmills: oh that’s right
[4:28:07] Reiumi_: LOL
[4:28:07] Spawrro: rip big damn judge Sadge
[4:28:14] BludlockFS: big dam judge.. 40k loool
[4:28:20] Telarius1: we would miss out on crusader yelling big dam and doing 37k judgement
[4:28:22] zachgamegodx: 70-80k denounce crits tho..
[4:28:23] Blitzylive: can we see some gnome warrior play Ven?
[4:28:25] kusoneko: "UNHEALABLE DAM" 25k judge
[4:28:26] hamsti: We need to bring back deathlobsta style of hpal
[4:28:29] hamsti: OMEGALUL
[4:28:40] Sheepyou: Denounce should be baseline
[4:28:55] Telarius1: denounce isnt simple dam toh, its pretty OP
[4:28:57] Reiumi_: I miss good karma every time I spec into WW Sadge
[4:29:08] BludlockFS: They should hire Elite as a consultant to design Hpal for next xpac
[4:29:12] Reiumi_: true
[4:29:17] Telarius1: the HP buff, indirectly buffed karma too
[4:29:19] snackstick1989: Cant decide to level hunter or monk. What do you say?
[4:29:35] madaIone: omg you look exactly like josh segarra from arrow haha followed to say that helo xd lancan1Zpzpzp zemieHi
[4:29:35] Darkleo28: @borngood I think anywhere from 55k to 80k is fair. For a instant it might even be too high
[4:29:35] PunishedLrnz: the rework of holy paladin was best ever, i think paladin is so fun to play now
[4:29:49] Cocoapuffs1: They need to move from relying on criting so much
[4:29:51] Borngood: it's not a pvp problem thank god, it's a total game problem for hpal so high chance it's already being looked at
[4:29:52] ThePdfreak: from watching it seems a bit clunky
[4:29:52] itsHomicydal: nah bro he looks like Kenny Florian
[4:29:53] chaps_86: @snackstick1989 ww is better overall ; survival is the most fun spec in the game =D
[4:29:54] Holyryze: problem is if the ybuff hpal dmg they become raid god healers again
[4:30:00] Holyryze: so they will always sacrifice pvp for pve
[4:30:13] hamsti: that m+ hpal doesn't even play hpal anymore... true @Borngood
[4:30:15] MakuuuTV: yooo
[4:30:17] madaIone: bro you are him
[4:30:17] itsHomicydal: look up kenny florian LOL
[4:30:18] heymomimonttv: 8/10 look alike tbh
[4:30:19] Telarius1: other than hair, not really similar
[4:30:19] krisdahaka: wow

[4:30:25] Darkleo28: That's pretty close lol
[4:30:26] mahz: Cousins maybe
[4:30:26] vmills: lololol
[4:30:28] ItsKishu: U but old
[4:30:28] likeewlock: older version of you
[4:30:28] Badasti: just the hair and head shape, thats it
[4:30:28] krisdahaka: it's insane
[4:30:31] legiontheworgen: first time someones said you look like someone and its actually accurate
[4:30:32] bollskis: u kinda look like my boss ven. can i haff a raise pls

[4:30:37] bransby09: You also look younger
[4:30:38] BigGainz: his nostrils flare up more
[4:30:40] Luigicamp: mouth is completely off though
[4:30:42] madaIone: @legiontheworgen zemieWiggle
[4:30:44] krisdahaka: this looks like an AI image of you KEKW

[4:30:56] Badasti: the supatease stare
[4:30:57] srslysnek: felt that in my soul
[4:31:02] NPBeharry: lmao
[4:31:04] Luigicamp: yeah no, maybe a long lost cousin, but that's it
[4:31:05] Reiumi_: twins
[4:31:07] Wrathbb1: u ned to squint not furrow your brow
[4:31:07] Borngood: hmm
[4:31:07] heymomimonttv: lmfao thats the supa stare on god
[4:31:08] Reythewrecker: great stuff

[4:31:23] Reiumi_: NOPERS
[4:31:23] bruce_t_wayne: two handsome men tho
[4:31:26] reedthesham: profile is nope
[4:31:26] FelQueen: Eyes are different
[4:31:26] stealthwalker99: I think enh needs some help after the last balance changes nothing really dies except you. The spec identity is a melee glass cannon so buffing its damage is probably best
[4:31:26] BigGainz: TWINSIES
[4:31:27] Kymagez: lol
[4:31:28] beastnephew3: lmao
[4:31:29] Luigicamp: he has an Italian nose, you don't

[4:31:45] laureldbz: nose different
[4:31:46] Reiumi_: nah your side looks better imo
[4:31:53] Kymagez: tiny ears
[4:32:04] ButtaTWD: hola
[4:32:33] zachgamegodx: nobody bring up taht 1v2
[4:32:42] ButtaTWD: I needed green lizard in my coms yesterday to kill through karma sadge
[4:32:42] beastnephew3: whered the name kazenokage come from
[4:33:27] WardenDOTA: i always kill my teammates through karma
[4:33:28] Moobot: Latest video "We Just Got A First Look At The Mage Hero Talents Coming In 11.0" view it here: youtu.be/-q4ekr2IRjA
[4:33:28] Badasti: then people would be like 'why didnt bro just heal'
[4:33:45] Badasti: oh brother
[4:33:52] Telarius1: THE Kazekage is 1 of the 4 Hokage of Naruto
[4:33:52] vmills: supatease strat sounded good but I have no idea how the heck anyone would have thought of that in the moment lol
[4:33:57] Kymagez: or dark fart
[4:34:00] nameyourform: raiku is a true hero, he tweets everyday at the devs to fix MMR lol
[4:34:18] Telarius1: He jsut thinkts its inflating too slowly
[4:34:25] likeewlock: I mean u startet with a fresh toon in solo on 1,6 mmr
[4:34:26] smoothytoothy: hes too high rated LUL
[4:34:34] Machine1312: Ven you always do an awesome job at casting but have you ever thought about competing?
[4:34:52] jontepman: that’s high, a new toon should start at 1500
[4:34:57] nameyourform: 40 min que, i win 4 out of the 6 rounds and lose mmr
[4:34:59] BludlockFS: Ven won blizzcon
[4:35:02] jontepman: so it’s already inflated then
[4:35:06] Telarius1: ven has never competed
[4:35:16] ButtaTWD: I also should’ve waited to fear when he karma instead of before but hindsight always 20/20… that’s why I respect players like you and the other tournament goats who can make better split second decisions
[4:35:17] Scargon231: if ven is old, then im ancient....
[4:35:18] DiscoSlim: why did you retire?
[4:35:19] BludlockFS: 3 Amigos, Ven Snutz & Cdew.. before that u had Kollectiv i think.

[4:35:49] zachgamegodx: @ButtaTWD a well known DK told me that wasn't in ur favor tbh
[4:35:52] zachgamegodx: even tho its a 2v1
[4:35:54] Blitzylive: ven is known for the "down goes Venruki" video for no ice block use death

[4:38:03] flattstv: He queued unholy ln on meep's stream
[4:38:03] shroomkinz: what was the “riot” in the awc twitch chat about PvP people are talking about?
[4:38:06] zachgamegodx: is there any world where meep plays clouded focus over uplifted spirits so he doesnt oom so fast
[4:38:10] BludlockFS: Team Liquid is just unstoppable.. i dont know if anyone else strategizes on their level for competition.
[4:38:12] zachgamegodx: idk clouded focus for caster mw is so good
[4:38:24] ButtaTWD: I had 2 months earlier this season where I’d message almost everyday to play unholy hahah he definitely isn’t just frost but it is hard to peel him off it
[4:38:46] JBugaboo: trill just understands pve rotation so good he outdps's every other rogue
[4:38:47] chaps_86: @BludlockFS liquid was fortunate to not see the move last weekend =D
[4:38:55] Holyryze: the fall of echo (fall used loosely) has been super interesting
[4:39:24] imitatewater: echo with mehhx was something else
[4:39:29] imitatewater: @venruki
[4:39:29] Holyryze: his terenas who says it but thats why is said loosely
[4:39:31] bollskis: if u aint first u last
[4:39:32] peccancyx: I like echo a lot but I was happy to see someone else win for a change.
[4:39:35] Scargon231: i think it was arthas's dad that said that
[4:39:35] flattstv: I wish kawaii would come back
[4:39:39] JBugaboo: did mehh quit?
[4:39:46] BludlockFS: Echo needs Mehh & they prob dominate.
[4:39:51] zachgamegodx: it's not a priest or evoker meta, meh's 3rd best healer is a paladin
[4:39:56] nameyourform: just imagine if liquid lost cdew. they would have to adjust just like exho
[4:39:57] nameyourform: echo
[4:39:59] rvdsupremas: if they took the gamble and went warlock in the last game. prob a win
[4:39:59] Blitzylive: no king rules forever? Lich King.....hello?
[4:40:01] Badasti: this meta is also a bit different with DH and melee cleave stonks being up
[4:40:07] dromare: i think people also forget how oppressive RMP used to be before the trinket and health changes and echo just used to play RMP
[4:40:12] BludlockFS: Interesting. I do like Lontar alot though.
[4:40:13] madaIone: gn guys lancan1Zpzpzp zemieHi
[4:40:18] imitatewater: mehhx is goated af
[4:40:27] stealthwalker99: If they nerf Cyclone I think liquid would be a lot less intimidating
[4:40:32] skyestormz: healers always get blamed lol
[4:40:33] rvdsupremas: if they took the gamble and went warlock in the last game. prob a win
[4:40:35] smoothytoothy: right echo still actually picked lontar, its not like he was just randomly assigned to the team
[4:40:36] JBugaboo: yo ruki, that 2v3 to 1v2 match was insane what'd u think
[4:40:49] Kymagez: they need crusader
[4:40:50] Kujo_XX: What is the addon that scrolls the skills used icons across screen?
[4:40:53] xBenww: cyclone can atleast break on dam
[4:40:59] nameyourform: Sam deff is the best fake caster NA lol
[4:41:00] prayful_x: what do you think about sod? lol
[4:41:15] prayful_x: thats how i feel
[4:41:18] Wrathbb1: cyclone is basically the ret of healers. Even if its balanced it feels unbalanced to play into when its balanced
[4:41:20] prayful_x: lol
[4:41:24] rvdsupremas: moonkin not that hard to get fakes :P
[4:41:25] WardenDOTA: its easy to fake cast when ur casting a must-kick spell
[4:41:29] bollskis: i agree sod is straight doo doo
[4:41:30] rvdsupremas: agree
[4:41:43] nameyourform: if he doesnt fake all those cast. Liquid loses 100%
[4:41:52] peccancyx: How'd you feel about those insane spirit link kill times?
[4:41:57] baxter5569: i wish cyclone was dispellable
[4:42:03] baxter5569: would fix most issues with it
[4:42:09] ferahgok: @nameyourform Yea it's so annoying how dependent boomy and feral is on cyclone now
[4:42:10] rvdsupremas: @baxter5569 maybe in the future
[4:42:17] vegetibilis: infernal strike should single target 100k each slam eh do you concur? the spec needs to gyat people off the map harder but the cc chain is gross
[4:42:23] zachgamegodx: alot of ppl are plotting to prep a backpocket ret warr fw for free wins on move
[4:42:46] nameyourform: yeah poor feral. legit have to leave cat form to clone, JUST to get the frenzy to do dmg
[4:43:20] Badasti: probably an unpopular take but i dont jusy think cyclone should be dispellable, but i dont think druids should have spammable cc either
[4:43:22] WardenDOTA: jaime says otherwise
[4:43:27] tmh1995: the fact that u play precog as feral is dumb too
[4:43:31] Wrathbb1: @WardenDOTA jaime says a lot
[4:43:33] Wrathbb1: has since mop
[4:43:36] nameyourform: "jamie has entered the chat"
[4:43:38] nameyourform: lol
[4:43:42] pvalue01: should clone have a CD?
[4:43:42] Badasti: id rather see cyclone function more like hex
[4:44:02] baxter5569: there is a reason he is called "clonecity" because he just cyclones ppl, dots entire team and then waits for the go. the class is literally just a cyclone spam class
[4:44:18] satirically1: just make cyclone dispellable
[4:44:25] socbrotes: feral pred swiftness should cast instant clone again

[4:44:43] weevinx: he was juking himself at one point though. if you juke cast to much aren’t you just wasting global after a certain point though lol.
[4:44:48] BludlockFS: Give every healer a Cyclone dispel but make it casted.
[4:44:58] rvdsupremas: every class should get cyclone
[4:45:00] Wrathbb1: @chaps_86 not if it makes you immune to damage and healing but can be dispelled
[4:45:01] rvdsupremas: haha
[4:45:02] Blitzylive: make cyclone dispellable imo

[4:45:36] WardenDOTA: these shuf q times have been so heinous lately
[4:45:41] BludlockFS: it shouldnt just be a quick dispel though.. make it casted dispel & i like that. Just make a new class of dispel that dispels everything but casted.
[4:45:44] socbrotes: sterge isn't in a group
[4:46:02] Nickystr1x: queue up dps, queue never pops, swap to a healer, queue pops but my blood pressure goes up, log off
[4:46:07] BludlockFS: but i dont like cyclone having a cd, thats bad imo.
[4:46:08] imitatewater: @venruki why do you think danny played casted mw these last series?
[4:46:16] JBugaboo: @Nickystr1x i feel that
[4:46:19] stealthwalker99: Cyclone is on the same dr as fear, it should be a stationary fear and would be a lot less toxic. Although it would change rbg meta a lot
[4:46:34] lilcoooooom: @imitatewater to show hes the better mw
[4:46:47] heymomimonttv: cyclone is flatout oppressive atm
[4:46:57] BludlockFS: but cyclone is cool because its such a skill play.. you can do so much stuff with great clones.
[4:47:01] Badasti: and poly is more shit than all of them
[4:47:08] jayyArrington: cyclone the longest ain iy
[4:47:11] jayyArrington: it*
[4:47:20] Garthd: oh shit, first lege axe in the bank boys!
[4:47:20] zachgamegodx: ya like in the void game
[4:47:24] pvalue01: when they nerfed CC durations, didnt they leave clone untouched? that was weird
[4:47:26] zachgamegodx: the game was just over bc of a lucky cyclone timing
[4:47:28] vegetibilis: right now veng has the double fear tripple silabce double chains illidans grasp nova impison trample combo
[4:47:29] zachgamegodx: ona heal
[4:47:29] heymomimonttv: @Garthd dang, grats
[4:47:43] zachgamegodx: over in 20 seconds
[4:48:06] Wrathbb1: prideful damn s15 rihgt?
[4:48:22] Garthd: @Garthd  FeelsOkayMan
[4:48:32] ferahgok: @pvalue01 They normalized the casted cc to 6 seconds. So boomy was unchanged. However season1 had gear that reduced cc duration. So cyclone was effectively 5.1s that season until the cc changes. So it didn't get "buffed" directly at least

[4:52:12] Vendelbooo: can someone just tell me instead of me having to download this one
[4:52:33] socbrotes: @venruki the wowhead link shows cyclone has the Unaffected by school immunity flag. Do you think removing that flag would be a reasonable suggestion? Kick druid on clone, they can't heal...
[4:52:45] rvdsupremas: venfuki = healer?
[4:52:53] crooked_paw: hard times - paramore
[4:52:59] crooked_paw: (song)
[4:53:06] Vendelbooo: thank you man
[4:53:14] loopermann: they have hots, no need for heal :))
[4:53:17] SirBeaverTeeth: @socbrotes cyclone is nature so yeah, they can't heal when kicked xd
[4:55:08] WardenDOTA: @socbrotes i think that flag just means targets that are immune to nature damage can still be cloned or something? it definitely still gets locked out
[4:55:12] weevinx: how do you show combo points above nameplates?

[4:57:25] socbrotes: @WardenDOTA ah ok, makes sense.
[4:57:29] ram13ll: Hey Ven.. do you think the punishments for leaving game should be harsher? so many times a bad healer leaves after 3 losses in a row and if you were unlucky to be in the team you lose so many points
[4:57:52] JBugaboo: ^^^^^
[4:57:53] serp7: serp7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:58:14] JBugaboo: if someonme leaves you should all just leave with 0
[4:58:19] IIyena: i think each sequential leave should compound into harsher punishment
[4:58:48] ryanblue98: if someone leaves you should get back to head of que as dps if reque
[4:58:56] Kymagez: yeah everyone else get 0 points and leaver get - *
[4:59:03] Kymagez: would be simple
[4:59:04] stealthwalker99: Given enough games statistically you will be on the reverse end at some point so it actually has no impact long-term. Short term impact though yes
[4:59:13] rvdsupremas: how u target totems u want to kill? mouse click?
[4:59:18] robfrmamzn: NotLikeThis
[4:59:19] socbrotes: what about adding overwatch block feature to shuffle?
[4:59:25] ram13ll: I agree with that..but unfortunately thats not the case now..
[4:59:30] dakila24: do you thinking leaving not affecting mmr is a bug or intended?
[4:59:33] vmills: @jbugaboo I somewhat agree with that but after waiting 30 min going 4-0 and someone leaving feels bad. I think if you go positive you get positive but if you were going to go negative you get 0 would be ideal
[4:59:34] socbrotes: so you can block leavers
[4:59:39] JBugaboo: wow devs have shown that they dont care about pvp so rip
[4:59:52] robfrmamzn: leaving does lower mmr and cr i thought
[5:00:14] dakila24: didn't even think of that, makes sense tbh
[5:00:52] NewDee: guys whats more fun to play lock or sp?
[5:01:07] IIyena: lock
[5:01:19] JBugaboo: @vmills i agree
[5:01:53] limit77: InuyoFace
[5:02:06] robfrmamzn: oh leaving lowers CR and not MMR thats crazy
[5:02:15] rvdsupremas: how do you target totems ven? mouse click?
[5:02:18] Dimistarr: ggs ven
[5:02:23] xn0tagain: gg

[5:03:37] JBugaboo: yeah and the last time pvp was mentioned was season 1
[5:03:51] xdtai: @JBugaboo thats because you went against people way lower than your mmr
[5:03:58] xdtai: mmr in this game works like every other games mmr
[5:04:01] fistweaveurnan: Hasnt it been ab 2 months since a forum post saying theyd look into mmr
[5:04:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: ion said at Blizzcon that PvP is an essential part of the game and they're going to keep working on it
[5:04:10] xdtai: if you go against worst players relative to you. you will gain less. better players, gain more.

[5:04:36] Spawrro: they looked into it, they decided its fine

[5:04:41] rvdsupremas: i also believe there is a hidden mmr. when i pushed 2100. i get win streak of 8 50/50 fair chance. and then i get same comps and i get TOTALLY outskilled by 20x
[5:04:41] Philand0: hope season 4 brings cr to battleground blitz
