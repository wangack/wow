[0:56:27] sadstruggle: towCopium towCopium
[0:56:35] francescothepainter: far along
[0:56:48] Odinslayer: but i think we will test talent trees and dracthyr at start right? as they said
[0:56:49] onlygoesham: !ALPHA
[0:56:49] Moobot: @onlygoesham PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[0:56:51] Rudric_Ice: asmon will break the game and a Dev will show up on Asmon's stream LUL
[0:56:53] Gooseberries: This is a SLv2 they're behind and trying to push something out not ready
[0:57:16] Kinghorn: good morning tghHi
[0:57:16] jkitchin75: @Gooseberries towStop towIt
[0:57:28] klocky: Reckon there will be anymore talents out today?
[0:57:31] Dinermoe: i highly doubt that
[0:57:35] tornbraclet: that is one thing i am looking forward to is the crafting changes
[0:57:36] Zivs: yeah NW was
[0:57:40] Thoreya: it was available definitely early
[0:57:42] Thoreya: not sure hwen
[0:57:48] Spaede: I bet you first day of alpha will be testing pets shit, like that sweet article talked about
[0:57:48] Crowargus: i actually really interested in the ui method have banned elvui in df n  max reckons hes switching to blizz ui
[0:57:49] Rudric_Ice: maybe new uldaman dungeon will be available ?
[0:57:55] Dinermoe: i mean bastion was the first zone to test, no?
[0:57:58] jmalmin: Dont use copium :) Just saying what blizzard themselves have said.  Just hitting  dummies with my class would be all I need for the first alpha build.
[0:57:59] Dinermoe: it was the leveling dungeon
[0:58:01] lithium364: they didnt even make an dungeon video like they always do during the presentations
[0:58:01] szble: the zones are linear this expansion right
[0:58:20] feherlofia123: @szble nope
[0:58:31] Zivs: they are
[0:58:32] manmower: im still watching that badass cinematic on repeat
[0:58:33] Necrom93: Did you recently boost the character? If so, I don't think they can do world bosses for a bit.
[0:58:37] Zivs: you can't go in any order
[0:58:48] feherlofia123: @zivs u can choose
[0:58:52] Spaede: Lol

[0:58:58] lord_euphi: it should be more content available then in the first SL alpha, regarding the dev stage we are probably in this late
[0:58:59] Vorrain: do you think all classes will be ready to go day one of the alpha if we havent seen all talent trees yet?
[0:58:59] Gooseberries: @jkitchin75 Stop being realistic? We're like abuse victims at this point. I was cautiously optimistic last xpac now I'm numb and not even remotely interested.
[0:59:00] cabalish: @Zivs but only for the first time ?
[0:59:03] lithium364: pet battle people malding out
[0:59:09] Zivs: yeah, on alts you can choose
[0:59:13] Crowargus: ive never leveled a pet to max level lol
[0:59:13] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[0:59:16] manmower: pet battle rating
[0:59:19] cabalish: nice
[0:59:21] jmalmin: Pokemon is a big thing even in wow
[0:59:26] Kronvig78: Pet battle is still in the game?  lol
[0:59:33] tricky_86: You don't realize the amount of people that play pet battles. There are more than PvPers lol.
[0:59:34] Thoreya: maybe well get solo que testing for first alpha build
[0:59:35] szble: pet battles lol
[0:59:45] Spaede: For reals though, I’m guessing evoked starter zone, to big of a hype train opportunity to not showcase the new class
[0:59:59] feherlofia123: id love for them to have the fate option for leveling alts, its so fast for tanks n healers
[1:00:01] Rudric_Ice: new uldaman dungeon might be available but who knows...
[1:00:11] ToadyMcToadFace: Pet battles are lit tho
[1:00:23] jkitchin75: @Gooseberries so why you here
[1:00:25] Artiiz: when are we getting the new twitch prime wow head transmog
[1:00:31] manmower: is that the pet dungeon?
[1:00:37] Dkgungo: wait theres a new uldaman dungeon?
[1:00:46] feherlofia123: @dkgungo yep
[1:01:12] manmower: those stone people probably live there

[1:02:09] DecayedmiNt: We're going to go to Uldaman and hear "EYY, Miss me, Champion?"
[1:02:21] Zivs: @Kainiee yea
[1:02:27] Sielu11628: On the Dragonflight website, it says “new wings of Uldaman” under the new dungeons section
[1:02:30] Gooseberries: @jkitchin75 Same reason anyone watches streamers. I like the person. And stop getting it twisted just  because someone isn't super hyped over what little drip fed news were getting doesn't mean we wont play. Sticking your head in the sand doesn't help anything.
[1:02:35] Austei: "worse xpac ever!"
[1:02:39] Odinslayer: 5 months total testing is the lowest alpha/beta testing ever of all wow expansions, i dont think it will happen
[1:02:42] Juniorc954: !uptime
[1:02:54] pavepawns: Towelliee how much have you played the alpha?
[1:02:56] manmower: are they redoing mechanics of old dungeons for when they enter m+ rotation?
[1:02:58] jmalmin: Wasnt there Alpha/Beta that was 4 months?
[1:03:19] Odinslayer: @jmalmin which expansion?
[1:03:26] Zivs: LUL Legion throwbacks

[1:03:39] jmalmin: I do not remember I think it was a early one.
[1:03:40] Sarocus: That meme is tradition
[1:03:42] Crowargus: i saw a comment of someone looking at talents n they said it looks rushed wanted to ask how can you tell lol like sriously
[1:03:44] Scoodles91: even the version is 7.0.1
[1:03:45] pavepawns: guys its dragonflight of azshara Kappa
[1:03:50] Collected1: that's what we call a "dad joke" here
[1:04:01] Zivs: Ion even mentioned this leak when they announced the name of the dungeon lol
[1:04:10] king_julian_96: blizzard announced most likely that alpha will be on the 14th next thursday if true then well done toweliee you guessed the date of df alpha correct
[1:04:11] s_t_o_r_m__: guild wars already have dragonflight Kappa
[1:04:20] Kinghorn: aquatic dragons PrideSaba

[1:05:03] Odinslayer: nope no way you knew at all nope Kappa
[1:05:05] Crowargus: i agree lucid this guy was literally talking out his ass lol
[1:05:31] manmower: broken clock is right twice a day
[1:05:34] pavepawns: i personally  called the 12th to be alpha
[1:05:36] iloveyalunn: MMO_Crazies
[1:05:55] mayimbe1973: broken clock is still right twice a day
[1:05:59] Phalian01: toweliee knows because he signed a nda for it
[1:06:00] jkitchin75: it means even a broken clock is right 2 times a day
[1:06:02] Collected1: it's a viewer here 100%

[1:06:27] Tabaron: No
[1:06:30] Crowargus: haha
[1:06:35] Dagomarus: Im familiar with Blizzard Kappa
[1:06:39] akia03: well you can now see that the ure dps classes trees look meh esp hunter one looks meh
[1:06:46] RolexKT: Wouldn't surprise me
[1:06:48] xXSiebzehnXx: Good morning! towHAMUP
[1:06:50] Birder_L: microsoft 2020Suspicious
[1:06:54] Dystilled: Its a pretty common thing in sports, theres sources within every team that give info to the media, no way to stop it unless you know who is leaking stuff
[1:06:56] Kinghorn: nobody out pizzas the hut
[1:06:59] MrGM: I think someone down the line is gonna get fucked
[1:07:04] wowking35: @Gooseberries when is pre path
[1:07:22] Dystilled: Thats also a pretty common tactic, yea
[1:07:23] Thoreya: seems like blizz leaks everything themselves lol
[1:07:26] Kinghorn: blizzard has never leaked, not once
[1:07:31] lithium364: its zorbrix second job isnt it
[1:07:33] Kinghorn: cobaltSmug
[1:07:40] Kinghorn: did they let him on another tour???
[1:07:40] pavepawns: pyromancer is still alive?
[1:07:42] Kinghorn: smh
[1:07:44] king_julian_96: anyway what's your thoughts on the rouge and hunter talent tree towelliee

[1:07:56] Korupcija_: he quit wow, he is FF loremaster now
[1:07:59] NieIas: im gonna laugh when he comes back for DF
[1:08:02] dracullus: maybe pyromancer had prophetic meltdown
[1:08:03] Thoreya: yea
[1:08:04] swervity82: CDR
[1:08:05] Thoreya: calcs too
[1:08:07] cobwebhotdog: !ALPHA
[1:08:07] Moobot: @cobwebhotdog PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[1:08:09] szble: cdr
[1:08:09] Zivs: Assassin and Outlaw has 2 different utilities
[1:08:10] cabalish: yep talent calc too
[1:08:15] Chrizzor13: its giga nice
[1:08:22] jmalmin: I thought pyro was done with wow
[1:08:25] Chrizzor13: but a nightmare for logs
[1:08:29] Collected1: it's the "how dare you make changes" ..... "this expansion has no changes" crowd
[1:08:29] manmower: once you see rogue abilities spread out in the talent tree, really visualizes how much utility crammed into one class
[1:08:32] mewkittymon: Wow head has it
[1:08:33] swervity82: enough to where you might want two rogues in your raid grp
[1:08:37] tricky_86: One has the pally 3% DR and the other has some raid CDR like priest.
[1:08:42] Thoreya: dope
[1:08:42] Korupcija_: too little too late!
[1:08:45] Thoreya: only took 6 months
[1:08:46] Odinslayer: yea finally
[1:08:49] Nowaayjose: i miss the days when The Jailer looked liked the Ice King from adventure time
[1:08:54] akia03: rogue is like here is all your baseline stuff with 10 different lego and azerite powers thrown in
[1:08:58] Zivs: Outlaw has a different one
[1:09:05] Thoreya: outlaw has a party buff as well
[1:09:08] lucid_wow: man rogue actually has some of the best talent trees its nuts
[1:09:11] iloveyalunn: Outlaw
[1:09:14] Rudric_Ice: people will only take outlaw rogues in DF
[1:09:18] Sarocus: Yeah, outlaw was th one people went nuts over
[1:09:23] Dystilled: Just another way to get damage reduc
[1:09:23] Angxlic: i think max said it can spike to 7%
[1:09:25] PvtHudson093: Outlaw has one
[1:09:28] KAHVITEK: Devotion Aura for rogues
[1:09:29] swervity82: yes
[1:09:33] Kinghorn: the boss does 3% less
[1:09:35] manmower: everyone does
[1:09:35] lucid_wow: yeah thats exactly how it works
[1:09:36] Kinghorn: so yes
[1:09:36] infinityarty: yhea
[1:09:36] BreakerG1: sounds like it
[1:09:37] tricky_86: Yeah its devo aura
[1:09:39] Dystilled: The boss overall will do 3% less from all sources
[1:09:39] lucid_wow: single target devo aura
[1:09:45] szble: assassination can use 4 poisons too
[1:09:53] Tordrek_: why would the wrong give a shit about tanks
[1:09:55] Dadghar: about time rogues have raid buff
[1:09:57] Tordrek_: rogue*
[1:10:01] Thoreya: outlaw rogue
[1:10:01] akia03: the hunter misdirect damage reduc would be op if it wasnt just for pet
[1:10:03] Thoreya: cdr for party
[1:10:20] Neruan: sub has 50% speed in shroud its basicly roar so also raidbuff
[1:10:27] lucid_wow: i think other dps basically already had similar, rogue was maybe (unless im forgetting something) the only class (not spec) in the game that didnt have any real raid utility
[1:10:32] Tordrek_: so much better
[1:10:34] Dkgungo: time to stack rogues lol
[1:10:34] Herzenliegen: @akia03 The new Hunter tree is crap
[1:10:35] AlmightyGarldof: so sub rogues are BIS for raids then
[1:10:36] Korupcija_: they need to stop
[1:10:37] wowking35: that is op
[1:10:38] Rudric_Ice: towStop towIt
[1:10:39] vaereee: its about 30 seconds per minute of CDR
[1:10:40] Zivs: I think someone said it's like 20 seconds per minute that is reduced
[1:10:43] tricky_86: Same thing as Priest
[1:10:48] jornj08: they can add this but yet classes like shadow priest cant even get their normal utility
[1:10:50] akia03: @Herzenliegen yep it is
[1:10:50] manmower: i think the raid buffs is an April Fool
[1:10:50] Thoreya: jpc saying its like 20 sec
[1:10:56] squiffyk: towCopium
[1:10:57] Rudric_Ice: towCopium
[1:11:02] vaereee: jpc said 30 u guys are on crack
[1:11:06] Dystilled: It does say "A major" not "all major". wonder how it decides what skill to reduce
[1:11:08] jkitchin75: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towLove towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium
[1:11:08] Elff11: Basicly outlaw's nice has been made in a raid buff @Towelliee LUL
[1:11:13] xXSiebzehnXx: towCopium
[1:11:16] lucid_wow: @Neruan not even close to as good as the assa poison or the outlaw cdr tho since shroud is like a 6 min cd
[1:11:19] sadstruggle: towCopium towCopium
[1:11:22] Molvonos: laughs in warlock
[1:11:24] Zivs: it's like fae for priests
[1:11:24] PvtHudson093: i wish towCopium
[1:11:30] vaereee: @Dystilled do u remember vision of perfection? that one
[1:11:34] Thoreya: ya outlaw is gonna be sick for m+

[1:11:42] emarol_dk: towCopium
[1:11:45] lucid_wow: @Dystilled probably just the spec's main big cd, combust, meta, blades, etc, basically whatever was on vision of perfection probably
[1:11:48] Neruan: @Neruan so thats why luiquid and echo say its almost mandatory i see
[1:11:52] infinityarty: god i hope not
[1:11:55] Angxlic: its only party wide

[1:12:01] Elff11: It does, cause it's party only
[1:12:05] Kinghorn: party of 5 outlaw rogues PogChamp
[1:12:07] xXSiebzehnXx: I doubt it’ll stack, but it’ll shift the CD windows
[1:12:18] vaereee: youll probably never get an extra 3 min cd, but youll get extra 2 mins on a 6 min+ fight
[1:12:23] Elff11: Just liek windfury, just bring 3 LUL
[1:12:24] Broongoon: could be done with 6 to 7
[1:12:34] Rudric_Ice: does sub have any raid buffs ?
[1:12:46] manmower: maybe warriors are getting Sunder Armor back
[1:12:47] tricky_86: It works exactly like the Priest ability and we don't stack them so we'll be OK
[1:12:51] Rob3phones: you can shiv it to boost it
[1:12:55] vaereee: @Rudric_Ice shroud movement speed buff
[1:12:57] vaereee: so yes
[1:13:09] Angxlic: sub has a roar pretty much, shroud of concelment grants 50% move speed for the duration
[1:13:14] lucid_wow: @Rudric_Ice basically roar in shroud but probably isnt insanely good
[1:13:17] xXSiebzehnXx: So shivs during dmg windows
[1:13:20] PvtHudson093: Someone said Sub has 50% movement inside the big steath
[1:13:21] lithium364: year ofthe spear
[1:13:25] manmower: rogues finally getting utility
[1:13:42] Rob3phones: yep
[1:13:44] pavepawns: i wanna see shammy tree
[1:13:45] Dkgungo: it would be nice to see some different classes get some love. always seeing mages and boomies is boring
[1:13:46] Elff11: yup
[1:13:49] iloveyalunn: Yes
[1:13:52] manmower: it's true, they had to many abilities to fit it on the tree
[1:14:01] king_julian_96: yeah and mm hunters don't get multi shot
[1:14:05] king_julian_96: for whatever reason
[1:14:11] Jokervenom1978: Im looking at my BM hunter tree and its rather exciting.
[1:14:14] akia03: or rapod fire

[1:14:18] Odinslayer: towCopium
[1:14:19] Thoreya: mage please
[1:14:19] WoWRoach: Makes sense though, I mean everyone calls most interrupts kicks.  So Rogue should have it.
[1:14:24] tricky_86: My guess is if you have it in all specs now its in the spellbook but if some specs do not have it now its a talent.
[1:14:32] cappei: Can't wait to see the Demon Hunter talent twig
[1:14:34] Thoreya: survival hunter looks pretty good too
[1:14:35] PvtHudson093: they have 7 talent tree's to release by Thursday
[1:14:40] Thoreya: bm hunter is gonna have like 10 buttons
[1:15:05] Odinslayer: i want to see ret paladin one ffs
[1:15:07] akia03: @Thoreya you just get % damage per 3 points spent and kinda meh otherwise
[1:15:09] brokenjester: is Nalak the last MoP world boss mount you need @Towelliee ?
[1:15:23] king_julian_96: if they realese one more before alpha then that would be 6 which would be half the classes
[1:15:24] manmower: the classes without class leads might take longer
[1:15:24] PvtHudson093: I hope Paladin is one of those that does release this week
[1:15:25] Nachozdood: wonder if stampede will ever be a good spell for hunters if not lets just go ahead and ditch that blizz
[1:15:29] brokenjester: noiyce
[1:15:34] laughing_octopus: man i wish they would remove holy power for pallies
[1:15:40] mayimbe1973: pikaboo was looking at rouge talents on stream last night he was excited about it
[1:15:46] AlmightyGarldof: But if Alpha comes out, then technically we will see them all, Copium
[1:15:53] AP__Simps: @Towelliee did you ever get the abyss worm mount then?
[1:16:01] Epixil: when does talent calculator come for rogue?
[1:16:08] akia03: dance on all rogues specs seems wierd
[1:16:20] vaereee: @Epixil it came about 5 minutes after the talents were posted lol
[1:16:32] Epixil: oh hahah sorry vaereee
[1:16:38] king_julian_96: hopefully they do pally next

[1:42:47] FranciscoTheMage: i remember the SL one i think they skipped the mousepad didnt they?
[1:42:48] WeinerMcCheese: yeah I only care about launch
[1:42:50] MrGM: you always get people who beg and cry for alpha/beta and play for like 10 mins
[1:42:50] Korupcija_: ye, all 12 of them
[1:43:09] reggiepowa: they should just test the talents, quests will be fine either way

[1:43:33] dcaptain1: I just want to see if we getting a rpg or more instance speed run esports
[1:43:39] reaprwolf: I just want to mess around with crafting
[1:43:41] DannyBoyWho: @Towelliee i just want beta to see if im gonna play my Lock or Mage thats it lol
[1:43:48] king_julian_96: but if blizzard are serious and actually goign to realese df this year then we probs have a 5 motnh testing period tops this time
[1:43:54] MrGharr: they should just public test the mechanics and systems not the actual story content
[1:43:58] Nachozdood: used to hate beta/alpha time cause i was a shaman and it felt like nobody was testing shamans for the longest time
[1:44:11] Wcvechten: talking about testing, Rextroy got a new video out according to wowhead

[1:44:16] Darkage93: DF !ALPHA
[1:44:23] raye_gaming22: we usulay geting inv on the raid testing week all of my guild
[1:44:23] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[1:44:26] facerolljack: I really just want to test endgame content and classes so I dont mind not getting Beta until there are max lvl realms
[1:44:39] Boosti661: most average players might not notice bugs
[1:44:40] WoWRoach: I don't play high level, but I'm an altoholic and play a lot.  I've gotten invited to 2 alphas.
[1:44:42] jasonbriggs: ive put 15 years into the game lol
[1:44:47] zMalloc: the unwashed masses
[1:44:48] paperzino: do you ever wish you could just play your paladin instead of rerolling for raid
[1:44:52] Miastrix: Hopefully this time they'll make sure to invite players that do a lot of crafting early on, as they can give a lot more feedback on the crafting system than some r1 pvper that has never crafted an item in their life
[1:44:53] lithium364: they sure as hell need feedback about casual content this beta
[1:45:07] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee have they decided if they are gonna break the API for RaiderIO and all that other stuff in Dragonblight?
[1:45:13] Draz3nx: do you think a battle pass similar to immortal would work for wow?
[1:45:19] Miklagart: there are a lot of players that never touch ptr and then expect to get an alpha or beta invite from blizzard
[1:45:30] BaldBroGaming: Its also free advertisement to invite content creators
[1:45:56] king_julian_96: won't we only have a 5 month testing period this time if blizzard are going to realese dragonflight this year
[1:46:00] reaprwolf: i never touch ptr and get invites for the last 2 xpacks soooo
[1:46:14] laughing_octopus: he played with pieces too
[1:46:28] laughing_octopus: ya
[1:46:32] reaprwolf: interested in testing crafting
[1:46:45] Kinghorn: for a day until he ninja's a molten core LUL
[1:46:45] Odinslayer: i mean i dont want to get alpha cause am pretty sure i will play it for 1 hour and never get into it again, rather have people who are in 24/7 get it
[1:46:47] akia03: hopefully they invite cassual players to test that part of df not just raiders/m+ and pvpers
[1:46:47] Cafe0le: didnt he play with pieces in nathria
[1:46:51] PrimalBF: I've had beta since Mists and never played any of them. Don't wanna spoil myself.
[1:47:03] laughing_octopus: ya they have a big discord im in it
[1:47:06] dcaptain1: hope new professions make playing viable to get gold over wow tokens
[1:47:10] paperzino: yeah theres some gold making streamers too
[1:47:37] AlmightyGarldof: wowhead's also pretty good at highlighting economic wow people, so they can check there too
[1:47:40] szble: you mean renown LUL
[1:47:46] Odinslayer: a time gated battle pass?
[1:47:52] Nachozdood: Gold for a battle pass wouldnt be to shitty imo
[1:47:54] WoWRoach: I don't play any other games, what exactly is a battle pass?
[1:47:57] Poriand: @gus_buzz just run 2 gathering professions . Easy
[1:48:05] cptrogers123: i dont like renown in sl
[1:48:09] physalis4: I’d pay for a battle pass if they removed the subscription
[1:48:12] king_julian_96: i think we probably have a short alpha period this time if blizzard intend to get dragonflight out htis yhear isay blizz will do a 2 motnh alpha and a 3 motnh beta
[1:48:18] szble: yeah the art team could carry that easy
[1:48:19] dcaptain1: @Poriand Easier to just have a job irl
[1:48:24] paperzino: are you going for shadowmourne in wrath classic @Towelliee
[1:48:29] manmower: needs player housing for collectors
[1:48:45] mayonaes: Perhaps when the new development members get ramped up we will see that quantity of content releasing
[1:48:48] cptrogers123: Then literally everyone would do it haha
[1:48:49] SethLan: reward, token. sounds good
[1:48:50] Schamanskii: Copium
[1:48:52] tronbadgames: token? more like a pet theyve tried to sell for the past few years
[1:48:53] Spectralmath: !alpha

[1:48:54] Mattias_Kz: What taste is your vape?
[1:48:57] szble: naw see this would make too much sense its not gonna happen
[1:48:58] sargent789: @Towelliee  if they need to do that then dont charge sub every month. just buy the expac to play!
[1:48:58] dcaptain1: that does not sound good to me
[1:49:00] Ribastur0075: more than raid/mythic plus/raids. stuff like goldsaucer also
[1:49:04] nephuhlim: thats how fornite worked i think, you buy the pass once and you get enough points to pay for your next one
[1:49:04] manmower: wow token at the end
[1:49:07] SethLan: MAKE people work for it
[1:49:25] Jokervenom1978: mmmmm cannoli
[1:49:30] Nachozdood: @Towelliee how would you feel if they charged gold to unlock the battle pass?
[1:49:32] Sollice: good morning friends
[1:49:35] SethLan: you need 10 finish raids to get 1 token
[1:49:54] Poriand: @sollice morning
[1:50:08] cabalish: @Sollice towHAMUP
[1:50:10] cynicalrapture: !ALPHA
[1:50:10] Neruan: clearly aspect points we need new AP Kappa
[1:50:10] Moobot: @Rapture94 PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[1:50:13] Cabone1: I prefer zeus juice for vaping, flavours are so smooth
[1:50:14] szble: prestige icons or some shit
[1:50:22] reaprwolf: that is how COD works. You buy 1st one then u play to get enough points for next one free and so on
[1:50:26] Nachozdood: like the WoD world spells?
[1:50:26] manmower: challenging world content was one of their design goals though
[1:50:34] king_julian_96: i think we probably have a short alpha period this time if blizzard intend to get dragonflight out this year i say blizz will do a 2 month alpha and a 3 month beta and then realese dragonflight mid december before chirstmas
[1:51:00] WoWRoach: I always forget to use those cypher abilities.
[1:51:04] Jokervenom1978: Not gonna lie. I would do a battlepass if it wasnt too expensive.
[1:51:18] Cabone1: probs popular opinion, world content sucks
[1:51:33] Miastrix: Oondasta flashbacks
[1:51:37] SethLan: there should be a token Reward system
[1:51:38] manmower: i think they're getting lots of inspiration from GW2

[1:52:26] JynxedLynx: I've always like the dynamic events in GW2
[1:52:28] manmower: the way GW2 events pop up would be cool in WoW
[1:52:42] manmower: multi-stage events
[1:52:42] marlamin: didn't they try that for the maw tho
[1:52:49] fatherfrag: I want Twilight Dev

[1:52:56] Cloudslinger: Wow has stuff like that in the maw
[1:52:58] sifer007: man i cant wait for the dragon shit
[1:53:06] daneifred: Its also reminiscent of the Warhammer Age Of Reckoning events

[1:53:55] Cloudslinger: Invasions were kinda like that too
[1:54:22] manmower: they should have smaller meta events constantly
[1:54:24] CanadianCataclysm: Like how Lost Ark had there world bosses
[1:54:31] SethLan: or ORG should have portals to different zones. where you go in the open and fight some world boss
[1:54:35] Ghoultv93: true!
[1:54:50] silodin: Okay, THD. whatever you say.
[1:54:51] CanadianCataclysm: Lost Ark bosses where if they go out of the circle it resets.. or like the Pirate ships

[1:55:55] Dystilled: World PVP doesn't exist. Only ganking
[1:55:56] paperzino: honestly i think they just need to make raiding more accessible thats my biggest issue
[1:55:56] Cloudslinger: I think a good set would be raising all current world content and world bosses whne a new season comes out
[1:56:00] SethLan: or they could have wpvp zones,. where you fight  something like in WoD
[1:56:08] Poriand: World pvp is so fun when new expansion comes out

[2:03:27] QuigsTV: @Sollice but ive been playing since vanilla
[2:03:30] manmower: grind dragonriding
[2:03:39] theviperleet: well with world pvp off the table its gonna be kinda weird to have nothing to do in the open world
[2:03:39] raye_gaming22: cant be worse than bfa and SL
[2:03:43] Odinslayer: younger crowd is me when i was 12 playing tbc... my son only plays fortnite and valorant its killing me
[2:03:43] Pr1m0x21: im 22 about to experience wrath for the first time man
[2:03:45] rekiosuTV: barebones core wow with no systems
[2:03:45] Bogzeh: how about some good systems instead of no systems at all
[2:03:47] manmower: gonna be like Pimp my Ride
[2:03:52] ShadoodHD: well apparently blizzard likes having a clusterfuck of systems
[2:03:53] onslaughtak: aslong as the main city is satifying to run in circles around
[2:03:53] goriath87: I wonder if crafting will require too much grind or not
[2:03:54] Sollice: Sollice gifted a Tier 1 sub to Thdlock! They have given 47 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:04:00] Prymordias: I am 26 and I think people my age are the young wave of players haha.
[2:04:03] Bennodkk: do you guys think the current drop chance and stuff with dungeons stay the same in dragonflight cause as it is rn you can run an entire day with dungeons and not get a single piece of loot it's so bad
[2:04:07] smygel: @towelliee im not like a regular viewer of yours. but whenenver im sick.. i 100% always watch you
[2:04:10] fat_european0: As long as they give us patches quickly and some decent casual content it should be fine
[2:04:11] nvnto: no, torghast / warfront / island dev time this time.
[2:04:14] Connectus: Can't judge a book by its cover. The game doesn't need an AP grind to work, in fact it was rather dull
[2:04:21] manmower: i hope they go bonkers on the dragon customization
[2:04:25] cptrogers123: Same lol
[2:04:26] onslaughtak: KEKW
[2:04:27] Sollice: @smygel That's because he is like the chicken soup of your streaming soul

[2:04:51] GFiTV: @Towelliee you think we getting alpha after mdi weekend? :)

[2:05:00] Moobot: @kokochris PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[2:05:01] cptrogers123: You are like S-tier background noice on twitch KEKW
[2:05:01] Connectus: WoD was horrible true
[2:05:02] Jarlan23: if playing alts isnt a pain in my ass then ill like the game
[2:05:04] Odinslayer: @soopaGreg typical wow player
[2:05:09] Connectus: They do
[2:05:09] Wcvechten: wdym, we had great Apexis Farms /s
[2:05:13] manmower: gonna have renown tracks to grind
[2:05:17] trenothy: we camped poundfist in draenor
[2:05:18] soopaGreg: @soopaGreg yeap
[2:05:18] onslaughtak: alt friendly from the start would be great
[2:05:22] goriath87: Draenor had no mplus
[2:05:22] Rudric_Ice: Bellular said the people who want AP back are dumb
[2:05:24] Bennodkk: hey you had ship missions in draenor
[2:05:25] onslaughtak: not 10.2.5
[2:05:25] Nolimitzor: @Towelliee  On BMAH is : X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME - Sargeras (US)  ... for 700k bidding atm.
[2:05:26] preheats_lawyer: @Towelliee Shadowlands was kinda the same with very little to do
[2:05:28] raye_gaming22: wod was giga chill for us raider i take that over SL and BFA on any day
[2:05:30] MOLAR305: if 10.0.5 fails, watch corruption come back
[2:05:32] tricky_86: The problem with Dranor was there was a year between updates, they don't do that, it will be fine.
[2:05:34] Cafe0le: not if you did pvp
[2:05:38] baaronthemonk: that's a good point, that's why i liked legion so much
[2:05:38] Bogzeh: wod with m+ might not be a complete disaster
[2:05:44] WoWRoach: Getting 50 level 3 garrisons was too much content for me.
[2:05:46] Connectus: @Rudric_Ice AP is horribly boring though. But there definitely needs to be content, AP isn't the right content
[2:05:59] cabalish: 2 mill in eu
[2:06:20] Jarlan23: they could add an account wide system to grind that isnt tied to player power
[2:06:21] Nevindaz: towOof
[2:06:22] Jarlan23: id be fine with that
[2:06:23] Poriand: Hopefully people like evoker. I think that will be big deal
[2:06:24] Sollice: I assume @Towelliee addressed the fucking tragedy that is the maintenance mode that is HoTS?
[2:06:24] Nolimitzor: @Towelliee yea around 5M on Ah ... but thats just a Bid so could get higher ... but many ppl dont use BMAH so its good to buy this days and resell
[2:06:30] raye_gaming22: all iwant is to raid with more than 2 cahrs and not ahve to grind 5hr a day for it
[2:06:39] manmower: a grind that just makes you better at world content could be good
[2:06:45] Poriand: @sollice so sad about it.
[2:06:48] Connectus: BfA was horrible too with the AP grind
[2:06:52] darkspyrokarma: They will need a timeless/mechagon like zone
[2:06:57] l_Phoenix_l: i think it would be great if blizz starts to recycle old content/zones, the world would get more use. not more new contetn currently
[2:07:07] Toudis: !ALPHA
[2:07:08] Moobot: @Toudis PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[2:07:17] Thdlock: i think hots was in maitnence for a bit they just steadily released their content over last year
[2:07:18] lithium364: does starcraft 2 still has "servers" for online play?
[2:07:19] Connectus: Legion felt rewarding to me, but after that it just got boring and dull. Felt like I did it for nothing
[2:07:21] manmower: heroes of the storm 2
[2:07:22] Thdlock: what they had left
[2:07:23] Sollice: Yeah I know. I really thought they would give it another look with MS. HoTS with so many more stable of characters they could pull in now. Halo, Doom, Minecraft etc
[2:07:24] SethLan: OR not.
[2:07:24] Nachozdood: Master chief and doomguy added to Hots
[2:07:27] NieIas: towCopium

[2:09:30] Nachozdood: they gonna add Doomguy and master chief 100%
[2:09:35] Sollice: HoTS is great for me because I am just a simpleton and HoTS is easy
[2:09:41] jarilrpg: they just had that deal with riot to have LoL on game pass, but they do not own it
[2:09:51] Brodih_: you should unlock the basic emotes on the channel, Sadge, Madge, PauseChamp, etc
[2:09:57] zMalloc: @manmower Smite is owned by Hi-Rez

[2:10:33] cptrogers123: Yea, why dont you have the basic emotes like sadge, madge, pog etc? @Towelliee
[2:10:37] tricky_86: We have not had a hero in two years for Hots so its not going to be any different.
[2:10:37] manmower: maybe rename it to Heroes of Microsoft
[2:10:58] Rudric_Ice: so that means Startcraft will be back ?

[2:17:59] PrillaGorilla: Because we have had back to back swamp ass expansions.
[2:18:06] Zivs: login screen in alpha towCopium
[2:18:10] Yofappafappa: honestly all i want to see is how the healer dragon plays
[2:18:20] redraidah: @Towelliee some ppl dont like the dracthyr dragon form. what do you think of combat being possible in human form and just swappng to dragon for certain abilities like meta style
[2:18:34] Kinghorn: captiv8 lie is a strong word, but yes
[2:18:38] Korupcija_: UI testing

[2:20:12] ToadyMcToadFace: Less systems = less testing no?
[2:20:17] cptrogers123: I dont like it
[2:20:17] AlphasaurusRexx: i cannot tell if youre hyped about this alpha test lol. you see a little sus about it
[2:20:19] szble: well they ignored all the bfa feedback so

[2:20:27] Zivs: im switching to it for sure
[2:20:28] manmower: maybe they have more robust internal testing now
[2:20:32] king_julian_96: toweiliee until i see bliz put out a post and say they are pushing the realese date back to 2023 i won't believe it is not realesing this year
[2:20:33] bowsers1: Do you think we will be able to move Buffs ?
[2:20:33] Rudric_Ice: i hate the HP bars
[2:20:34] robotninja20: i think theyre going for FFXIV feel to the UI
[2:20:34] Gutroan: I really hope theyll add player name plates
[2:20:36] Zivs: probably runs like butter compared to elvui
[2:20:36] Shinnzx: !alpha
[2:20:36] Moobot: @Shinnzx PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[2:20:38] Secondbreakfasttt: less addons like it
[2:20:38] tricky_86: They didn't need more time for BFA or Shadowlands, we new the issues early they just didn't agree.
[2:20:39] Bogzeh: pretty good
[2:20:42] redraidah: @Towelliee thing is the new class, ui, and talent trees are going to make this expansion feel like a real revolution like how legion was
[2:20:44] L4nds1ide: they should remove addons and weakauras
[2:20:45] Ety_TV: I hope blizz ban all addons exept the UI addons (if someone dont like the blizz UI to change it). But WA addon should go.
[2:20:45] Rocman: it depends on where they are at, just because they target test doesn't mean they don't have more advanced builds and content completed
[2:20:46] onslaughtak: elvui for me
[2:20:48] Behemian: can we change the shape of the UI elements?
[2:20:50] theviperleet: i mean they removed 100 systems out of the  game and implemented a new(old) system which are the talents, nothing really top mess up
[2:20:52] cptrogers123: most ppl are sticking to their ui i think
[2:20:56] szble: ff14 ui KEKW
[2:21:02] manmower: is a Torghast system making a comeback?
[2:21:04] redraidah: like when i left in panda and came back in legion i had NO idea all the combat animation updates they did and stuff and it really dazzled me when i came back
[2:21:07] Cafe0le: pretty sure some screens from the reveal showed a more elvui version
[2:21:10] Harch: they had an addon for that
[2:21:11] Kinghorn: did I just see someone say they didnt need more time for shadowlands?
[2:21:11] popfizz26: popfizz26 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:21:15] cptrogers123: Then there is Method that wont be playing with elvui KEKW
[2:21:26] Ralvay: they could do this like 10 years ago.. we dowload that moveanything kind addons billion times
[2:21:30] Yagr6: they talked about out the box they want to make buffs and debuffs easier to see for nw players... im curious!
[2:21:35] Herzenliegen: @kinghorn you did LUL
[2:21:36] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[2:21:39] redraidah: @Towelliee what do you think of no active damage meters but maybe a scoreboard at the end of the fight to  show who did most overall
[2:21:48] redraidah: but like not live during combat
[2:22:00] TheRiwen: I have only used default since vanilla. Has try others but it is not me
[2:22:01] Rudric_Ice: i use dominoes its the best UI addon
[2:22:05] redraidah: ok ok
[2:22:07] cptrogers123: Fuck that, we need damage meter
[2:22:18] redraidah: yeah im not against damage meter
[2:22:19] kazdin87: what ever happened to its ready when its ready, we have waited this long i would rather wait and it be a great game
[2:22:20] tricky_86: We really don't
[2:22:35] Piebringer619: imagine playing without damage meter in 2022 KEKW
[2:22:36] Goggetta: most people who complain about damage meters are usually the dps who end up below the tanks
[2:22:41] manmower: lich king movie?
[2:22:41] king_julian_96: do you think it's possible we get to october towelliee and blizz say sorry we can't realese dragonflight by the  end of the year so we going to push it back to january 2023
[2:22:44] Yagr6: wrath movie?
[2:22:46] Herzenliegen: @kazdin87 agreed
[2:22:47] captiv8: All they have to do is work on balancing the new talent system which is something that’s going to happen the whole xpac probably. Other than that…..quest bugs and raid bosses?  Sounds like 5 months should be plenty to me.
[2:22:47] Rytten: if wow alpha isnt in 9/10 shape we will be in a bad spot
[2:22:53] redraidah: @Towelliee whats your ideal dream mmo look like
[2:22:55] Nachozdood: they need to do animated movie the live action was so bad
[2:23:01] tricky_86: Its Thrall Durnhold Keep movie

[2:23:51] redraidah: idk i think they shouldnt be able to advertise releasing on or before dec 31. false advertising. they have to change the language to projected for 22 or something
[2:23:56] MrClaudeSeaburn: why would alpha be 9/10 wtf
[2:23:57] marlamin: the more incomplete > the more juicy the datamining

[2:27:32] Kinghorn: I think there is no shot it comes out in 2022 but also think it wont drop later than feb king_julian_96
[2:27:33] redraidah: do you think enough ppl really give af about an rts for blizz to make a huge risk making it? sales already will be projected lower due to reforged being a failure. just feel like they make more money doing anything else

[2:56:56] fligisx: sheeet im in the wrong field
[2:57:04] Odinslayer: you pay for a big package though
[2:57:04] lookitsmorgan: a package
[2:57:08] TrixStar36: That’s the point none of us really know I’m not sure if it’s something that you can discuss but it would shed some light on people who have no idea how much things are gonna cost
[2:57:15] lookitsmorgan: lookit46Danny
[2:57:19] fligisx: oh i get it.  i was thinking small lol
[2:57:21] wyman1990vc: dang dude it's that expensive
[2:57:21] Gecko4nine: i believe it.
[2:57:26] FranciscoTheMage: pay artists what they are worth!!!
[2:57:30] love_eggplant: I'm surprised you only pay 5 grand
[2:57:35] love_eggplant: designers are very expensive
[2:57:42] nvnto: some chatter is gonna say he can do it for half Kappa
[2:57:43] Frank4LuLz: spend that money at the casino instead
[2:57:45] Jotchua: I tip my landlord
[2:57:50] YardRage: people gotta eat
[2:57:55] captiv8: It’s a tax write off. Doesn’t matter how much they cost.
[2:58:03] Frank4LuLz: eat
[2:58:16] Nolimitzor: Same everytime i go in store buying grocery i tip them 20%
[2:58:18] studdmuffinnzz: I was robbed once, tipped them before they left.

[2:58:24] Frank4LuLz: i pay my landlord, so i have a place to starve
[2:58:27] Squats3: @captiv8 it being a tax write off doesnt mean its free
[2:58:28] tronbadgames: wtf? tax write off doesnt just mean its free lol
[2:58:29] swervity82: thats not how tax write-offs work
[2:58:37] RhomenTV: You dont wanna pay 5gs for a bad animation... guy has to have the talent to earn the 5k
[2:58:37] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee do you take bids or you know who you want doing it all the time

[2:59:04] Nerendis: 12g sounds reasonable honestly. I've worked with artists all my life. Shit is hard work and expensive
[2:59:04] RjAlcatraz: Well I’m glad to see battlenet is letting some people in I can’t login
[2:59:06] Squats3: business expense write-offs just mean you take that amount off of how much you made that year. which doesnt mean its free.
[2:59:09] roofeeo: animation is spensive
[2:59:12] MetalManGG: there are motion designers making $400 a day, depending on the project

[3:47:43] happybooger: @Towelliee https://goelvision.com/vision-solutions/smile-laser-eye-surgery/
[3:48:00] FranciscoTheMage: if lasik wears off. why get it
[3:48:05] Shadowlemur01: they cut a flap of your eye up, so they can laser your cornea
[3:48:06] manmower: just google lasiks speedrun video
[3:48:09] Dystilled: @stabzmcgeee they run a razor over your eye and peel it back
[3:48:20] stabzmcgeee: OH FUCK THAT
[3:48:22] Shadowlemur01: I had PRK done, where they scrub the surface of your eye instead of cutting a flap
[3:48:28] BJofBorg: I just fainted....
[3:48:40] GiraffeHydra_: @Dystilled Huh, my doc used a hammer to pound it into shape. Think I got ripped off
[3:49:09] silodin: `Free steroids? Pog

[3:49:31] Sarocus: Eye roids!
[3:49:32] bigoldmeatpie: not with that attitude, you can't
[3:49:33] manmower: yea but i bet you could get some of that eye bulge
[3:49:33] Shadowlemur01: Lasik, if you get an accident or take a blow to your head, they flap has a chance of popping up if it didnt heal well. So the military likes to do PRK
[3:49:39] GiraffeHydra_: Roid Rage, eye edition. Do you even flex these jelly balls boiiii?
[3:49:43] SensationalBanana: Just the idea of having someone point a scalpel at my eye... *shiver*
[3:49:43] chukudu: can you shoot lasers from your eyes like Homelander ? LUL
[3:49:46] HaxzorJimDuggan: towCopium

[3:51:20] Kamalii63: Not for me I would freak out
[3:51:30] kimmo_gaming: I like chocolate milk
[3:51:36] Shadowlemur01: My eyes were so bad, I couldn't see the biggest letter on the chart without glasses. So PRK was a no brainer for me

[3:54:26] DeanoTV: with more dungeons
[3:54:27] smygel: what a hack way to go to the island
[3:54:39] captiv8: I feel like the new profession system will be a decent grind by itself.
[3:54:54] Nico_vdM: I needed 5 mailboxes for my mail grinder :)
[3:54:55] Zivs: we will have patch every 3 months in Dragonflight towCopium
[3:54:58] The_Dane_Train: Filler content should be MEANINGFUL old works gameplay. After not playing for a while I came back and the world feels smaller than ever.
[3:54:59] TheItalianStallion321: @Sielu11628 yeah im not against you brotha, i think its insane people are saying theres no content. yeah, nothing has been released lol
[3:55:15] The_Dane_Train: Filler content should be MEANINGFUL old world gameplay. After not playing for a while I came back and the world feels smaller than ever.
[3:55:31] Dystilled: I know Dragonflight is going to come out just after I finish my degree. Dangerous
[3:55:44] TheItalianStallion321: they need to make world quests relevant again....6 months after the expansion is released. or something new i hope
[3:55:58] Fallen_Gabriella: @The_Dane_Train I'm sort of overwhelmed having to go back through all the expansions, hunting for low mount drops, because I quit during BfA. Sort of terrified to come back.
[3:56:34] MetalManGG: 6 figures? in this economy? KEKW
[3:56:37] manmower: job

[3:56:51] superpudd: is the Flux to alts thing live?
[3:56:51] Shadowlemur01: I quit doing them during 9.0
[3:56:54] TheItalianStallion321: agreed Towelliee
[3:57:04] manmower: if they earn you money that's fun too
[3:57:13] DrakeDuude: I hear a tim allen grunt... "more power"
[3:57:15] Claritycraft: I heckin' love doing the same wq for the 500th time to get a slither of player power BatChest
[3:57:16] NieIas: same
[3:57:22] Masqerader: i only ever did wq for that trinket
[3:57:22] Voqq: @superpudd yes
[3:57:28] DeeterDo: same WQs were so irrelevant in SL its like they didnt exist
[3:57:31] Rudric_Ice: i got a job offer as a QA analyst in ubisoft in france im still thinking if i should take it or not
[3:57:46] milton25: put cosmic flux and that soul shit in WQ's and people will do them
[3:57:46] Sielu11628: I’m really excited to see what the “separate outdoor content team” has in store.
[3:57:51] Nico_vdM: Champion severl open azerite wooooons lay exposed nearby
[3:57:54] Dystilled: @Rudric_Ice having to live with the french though :(
[3:58:25] Fallen_Gabriella: I'm a filthy casual who just quests, hunts for mounts from rare spawns, and wants pretty hunter pets. Like a scrub.
[3:58:26] Masqerader: I barely ever did the 3 wq for the aiding  the covenants or w/e
[3:58:27] Nevindaz: towF
[3:58:35] superpudd: @Voqq thanks bro
[3:58:36] PvtHudson093: by the end of the expac the WQ rewards never catch up in ilvl
[3:58:47] RjAlcatraz: @rudric_ice I would that job sounds fun
[3:58:50] Akermay: In that case then, based on what we know, how could world quests link to power in DF?
[3:58:55] Zivs: check when you finished your 5000 and 10000 world quest achivements @Towelliee probably in legion or early bfa
[3:58:59] nvnto: yeah but we cant say participation is high because of enjoyment, when they are tied to power. most people hated doing them and only did them for power.
[3:59:04] lithium364: whoever thought the maw was well designed for content must have been insane
[3:59:11] captiv8: Especially legion. You had a chance at a legendary for doing world quests.
[3:59:12] Rudric_Ice: @Dystilled  are french people like angry all the time or something
[3:59:15] Masqerader: I loved how seeing a weapon cache for an alt in bfa
[3:59:15] TheGiant99: Shit im on my new lock doing the class order hall stuff in legion to get the mount
[3:59:21] Shadowlemur01: especially when my cov armor looked like garbage
[3:59:26] Mecabeast: wq maxes at 213 now which is a joke compared to zm gear
[3:59:41] Sielu11628: Something I liked that they said was that each of the leveling zones would have endgame/max level areas in them that we can’t explore until later (endgame)
[3:59:44] dngrslythicc: not only do the WQs not reward anything good but the quests are boring and also WM in the zones is boring unlike BFA
[3:59:46] lithium364: i miss getting heroic gear from emissarys in bfa
[3:59:47] manmower: they still have that by timegating gear progress
[3:59:55] Nevindaz: it would be cook if they let you to choose any second legendary..
[4:00:01] Nevindaz: cool
[4:00:03] Cafe0le: i dont want to have to grind anything or do filler content just play arenas on different characters
[4:00:05] Shadowlemur01: yee
[4:00:05] Nevindaz: like in legion
[4:00:06] DeeterDo: sure did
[4:00:07] BlewGamingGroup: yup
[4:00:07] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:00:15] milton25: some of it was BIS too when it upgraded
[4:00:17] Masqerader: They have that power all they have to do is let me farm archaeology in any zone I want lol
[4:00:21] TheSabin: WQ for profession stuff maybe? now with the new system
[4:00:22] Snabido: Titanforged Arcanocrystal, hell ye brudda KKona
[4:00:22] Mr_conqueror: true

[4:02:32] NieIas: wodner how tuning for s4 is
[4:02:35] keeindordel: will u be at Blizzcon 2023 @Towelliee nephsyLove

[4:02:53] Radiopools: for real? no legendaries??
[4:02:57] Nevindaz: never say no..
[4:02:59] keeindordel: YET
[4:03:01] happybooger: they could add in a raid buff that increases your power week after week after week....
[4:03:03] keeindordel: the keyword is YET
[4:03:05] obbi87: @Towelliee tbh the best option for the most, a raid should last max 4-7 days for the top raiders. it would even be hard for the 99% others :P
[4:03:08] keeindordel: theres always gonna be a legendary
[4:03:09] Shadowlemur01: im going to be back west by then, was thinking about trying to go. Never been to a blizzcon before
[4:03:17] keeindordel: theres never been an expansion where there hasnt been a legendary
[4:03:20] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee what about the CATALYST will that return???
[4:03:36] FranciscoTheMage: or was CATALYST a stopgap for the Sepulcher
[4:03:47] Aidler: not doing any raiding… tiergear was useless for me
[4:03:50] happybooger: add the determination buff to mythic
[4:04:01] procyon_mfc: hitchHey
[4:04:48] Shadowlemur01: Maybe they need an ultimate style level of raid? or swap mythic with that
[4:04:52] Cafe0le: how are they going to make the catalyst through prof and not turn it into another gold sink like legendaries
[4:05:37] obbi87: Go back to LFR - N - HC, just remove mythic. more would be happy, the top raiders would cry, but lets try it out
[4:06:07] Thdlock: i told guilds to buy a mythic jailer lockout from a top guild and killl it if ur on anduin
[4:06:07] keeindordel: isnt heroic suppsoed to be easier than mythic??
[4:06:09] Nevindaz: I cant wait to see the drachtyr talent trees

[4:06:14] Thdlock: KEKW

[4:06:54] keeindordel: mythic+ killed cuting edge raiding for me @Towelliee PepeWhy
[4:07:04] manmower: this is one of the toughest raids they've made
[4:07:19] keeindordel: kept getting burnout  having to do an aspect of the game i never enjoyed doing
[4:07:38] Snabido: SMOrc Give us a patchwerk end boss Kappa
[4:08:04] Ralvay: I think bosses are not hard. people are too lazy.
[4:08:10] Masqerader: np
[4:08:15] captiv8: so say they made it easy.  you kill it faster.  then you just have to wait even longer for content right?
[4:08:19] Masqerader: damn dh should up outta nowehere
[4:08:20] Silverwards: the amount of splits last RWF was ridiculous

[4:11:30] Scraggersmeh: It's sad that Jailor is now significantly easier than every other boss before him.
[4:11:39] PvtHudson093: unless they do more nerfs than it will be the lowest CE boss ever
[4:11:39] Thdlock: its hilarious how many there is
[4:11:42] Thdlock: after recent nerfs
[4:11:46] procyon_mfc: Thats a great emote animation

[4:12:05] nvnto: Real question is: How many guilds did the Jailer kill. Kappa Kappa
[4:12:07] happybooger: i think Un'nat is going to hold the title for the lowest amount of CE kills
[4:12:13] PvtHudson093: Nzoth was over 2000
[4:12:17] keeindordel: what was difficult Jailer pre-nerf or Kil'jaeden mythic? @Towelliee

[4:12:22] tsktsk: But the issue isn’t that jailer was difficult but was hilandrous and beyond that blocked a lot of guilds
[4:12:22] Zivs: Damn only 334 for Crucible of Storms
[4:12:23] Ralvay: I mean there were too many guys in my guild does same mistakes over and over again. Than we had to stop raiding at some points because finding replace is harder than anything.  that's why I said people are lazy.
[4:12:36] bigoldmeatpie: how many killed ToS kil jaeden?
[4:12:58] ArcaneMaki: I guess player base attempting bosses reduced a bit as well.
[4:13:06] manmower: Anduin seemed like an end of raid boss
[4:13:07] The_Wicked_Wombat: its why I stopped raiding as I got old, dont have the time to wipe for weeks
[4:13:12] cahoots82: Anduin was the final boss of a scrapped tier
[4:13:12] NieIas: Manduin is the end boss
[4:13:17] keeindordel: my guild also died due to recruitment issues and Mythic Painsmith prog
[4:13:24] abracka_: anduin the gatekeeper
[4:13:29] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee anduin got mega nerfed. that number will change this week
[4:13:35] Buckwink: crucible was a vacation tier KEKW
[4:13:36] KingSlayerYotam: Sepuclar is just 2 final boss raids and it seems a lot of guild stopped at anduin
[4:13:37] Zivs: D:
[4:13:42] MistaHat: 832 for KJ in case people were still wondering
[4:14:08] Broomba: @towelliee do u buy a sunreaver beacon?

[4:15:29] Critz_1: what do u think about the new raid affixes in next tier? any information? would it be like necrotic or something?
[4:15:29] keeindordel: make every boss like mythic painsmith every single 1
[4:15:29] PvtHudson093: Maybe they should let CE/AOTC continue throughout S4
[4:15:42] Zavier420: Did anyone get the title from watching the MDI yet?
[4:15:46] TheItalianStallion321: call me crazy but i would LOVE to see the 1st boss not a pushover
[4:15:55] keeindordel: @Zavier420 lul a title
[4:15:56] Scraggersmeh: CE/AOTC continuing throughout S4 would devalue the hell out of actual CE/AOTC
[4:16:20] PvtHudson093: S3 has been shorter S1/2
[4:16:23] Critz_1: what do u think about the new raid affixes in next tier? any information? would it be like necrotic or something?
[4:16:29] Mattsta: I thought the title was from AWC not MDI
[4:16:35] robokop365: @Scraggersmeh it already devalied  with all these nerfs KEKW
[4:16:37] keeindordel: @Abutaleb1994 no1 knows what it is yet

[4:16:46] keeindordel: @Abutaleb1994 all we know is its called Fated

[4:18:48] keeindordel: @PvtHudson093 NAH BRING BACK 14 BOSSES
[4:18:55] Mattsta: I'd bet mage tower gets easier in prepatch with the new talent trees tho

[4:19:05] Scraggersmeh: Give us a goliath 20 boss raid tbh.
[4:19:06] TheCliffyShow: The real question is, when they gonna allow us to get the mage tower artifact appearances again? I want my Fencer's Reach.
[4:19:15] CianoHD3: domination socket shoulders
[4:19:15] toobaked1987: Towelliee we can send cosmic flux to alts now? What the heckarino, its about time!
[4:19:15] bigoldmeatpie: 8 or 9 bosses with a 2 or 3 boss smaller raid. better variation
[4:19:16] CianoHD3: wow
[4:19:18] keeindordel: @Towelliee  what if they go back to the 10-man 25-man style raiding or what if they made mythic raiding like flex raiding?
[4:19:39] arturiuss44: arturiuss44 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months, currently on a 57 month streak! 
[4:19:41] CVB111: wait what? thats sick PagMan
[4:19:43] toobaked1987: My main has over 70k
[4:19:43] TheItalianStallion321: you can send 1250 for 1500 KEKW
[4:19:49] Scraggersmeh: @keeindordel They'll never make mythic flex.
[4:20:00] Raaeni: finally a way to spend my 85k
[4:20:08] keeindordel: @keeindordel which is y i say they should go back to the 10-man 25-man style raids
[4:20:21] keeindordel: wouldnt mind being a 10-man mythic raider ;p
[4:20:26] cikisannn: !ALPHA

[4:20:42] captivate7: captivate7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[4:20:47] TheItalianStallion321: Max said yesterday...a 10 man mythic raid would be so difficult to put a comp together
[4:20:52] Buckwink: meh I actually like the way it is now
[4:21:12] Mattsta: I could see them going down to like 15man to make it easier for heroic guilds to dip into mythic...but def not less than 15 or flex
[4:21:15] bigoldmeatpie: it would just be 10 raid buff classes. no flexibility at all
[4:21:23] Scraggersmeh: Look how bad HC/Normal tuning can be currently with flex. You want that in mythic too?
[4:21:34] George2001k: I am all for flex LFR though
[4:21:36] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[4:21:42] dngrslythicc: they could just do special rewards for 10m and tune down a little
[4:21:44] TheCliffyShow: Sounds like an experimental Season 4 thing.
[4:21:44] Masqerader: locking in lust
[4:21:49] happybooger: i wish that they would get rid of raid buffs
[4:21:56] keeindordel: just either get rid of raid buffs or make every class/spec have a raid buff
[4:22:03] Its_Smoggy: is WoW worth getting into at this stage
[4:22:08] Zivs: I think the only solution is to bring back 40 man
[4:22:11] keeindordel: its not like we havent raided without raid buffs before Kappa (legion)
[4:22:11] Zivs: towCopium
[4:22:12] RayenDark: Druid is also now required for their buff
[4:22:13] Its_Smoggy: Used to play back when Cata first came out
[4:22:14] demonicyoshi: yea but with 20 u sometimes have to get people that get carried by the rest of the group
[4:22:16] TompsonX: Just like Classic Pog
[4:22:20] Mr_Pennywise_: HELLO ALL
[4:22:26] Scraggersmeh: @demonicyoshi No you don't.
[4:22:30] Scraggersmeh: Just replace them with actual good players.
[4:22:34] tsktsk: They could… maybe… get rid of class buffs/debuffs… but idk
[4:22:39] Scraggersmeh: You never need to carry terrible players.
[4:22:40] manmower: they could do mythic like heroic with flexible raid sizes, only reason they can't is because competition to finish first
[4:22:44] MistaHat: just need to make it ten man. Everyone complains about raiding is the same thing. Raid is hard to recruit and keep people, the amount of people is a lot. Then when you bring up lowering the amount people say you dont. Just get rid of raid buffs and the problem isnt there
[4:22:46] Armdel: umm actually blizzard already said the expansion is called dragonflight 🤓
[4:22:50] Masqerader: its like those people who ask for mythic + dungeon finder.. its like no i don't wanna be put in a grp without lust or bres lol
[4:22:51] bigoldmeatpie: whoever actually did make that though is really talented. it looks awesome
[4:22:51] demonicyoshi: @Scraggersmeh hard to when u no one is looking for guilds
[4:22:59] KillzwitchTV: well theres not only guild that maximise group theirs people who like to do mythic but dont care about comp and just do what they do i would love to have 10 man mythic and play with friends not all people cares about all that
[4:23:02] Broomba: i liked it thinking it was Dragon Flight and saw it was version 7 and realized you were trolling
[4:23:25] abra_dh: instead of trying to lower the amount of people in raid, maybe make more incentive to stay with guilds to raid
[4:23:33] PvtHudson093: KEKW
[4:23:33] Scraggersmeh: @demonicyoshi LOADS of people are looking for guilds my dude. Just take a simple gander at WoWprogress. OR, your recruitment officer should be doing their job and approaching players in other guilds. Because fuck this "Poaching is bad" mentality. Your guild's health is paramount. Who cares about other guild?
[4:23:40] happybooger: KEKW
[4:23:43] Alienfromger: lol
[4:23:45] Austei: LOL
[4:23:50] NieIas: it was a legion meme
[4:23:56] Snabido: Copyright and version should
[4:23:57] bigoldmeatpie: version 7.0.1 alpha
[4:24:00] Snabido: *should've gi ven it away
[4:24:01] Armdel: i remember when it was making the rounds
[4:24:04] MrGattz: towCopium
[4:24:13] Austei: even the logo is off in top left
[4:24:27] clambynature: @Towelliee Don't worry, I have refills!
[4:24:28] Broomba: people are literally loosing their mind
[4:24:28] PvtHudson093: You had me for a second till I really looked at it
[4:24:41] st3ts0n98: I finished all 6 of my tanks mage towers yesterday, now i can look cool while playing my 6 favorite specs
[4:24:48] raye_gaming22: looking for guilds with be a shitshow in s4
[4:24:54] Shadowlemur01: cross faction guilds when
[4:24:57] demonicyoshi: @Scraggersmeh u salty bro lol u one of those players that thinks they good than get carried lmao
[4:25:01] Buckwink: thats because there arent enough ally players
[4:25:06] Anneris1: we need cross faction guilds and account wide everything
[4:25:07] MoJoShMaN: for the horde!
[4:25:17] tsktsk: Cross faction guilds will solve it, I hope
[4:25:19] Orthobullet: My guild would actually do mythic if there was 10man
[4:25:19] manmower: i think once hall of fame finishes for a raid, they should let flexible mythic raid sizes kick in
[4:25:22] Scraggersmeh: @demonicyoshi ??? Bro, I'm top dps for my guild but keep coping. The fact is your recruitment officer isn't doing their job.
[4:25:24] KillzwitchTV: not  only alliance man .. when u want to raid with friend and ur like a frenc canadian guild and stuff its kina painful to keep 20 people all the time with 10 will be so freakin ez
[4:25:37] Buckwink: Area 52 and Illidan about to be on 2 hour log in queues KEKW
[4:25:45] Scraggersmeh: @KillzwitchTV Of course you're having issues when you intentionally limit yourself to a minority of a minority.
[4:25:45] Broomba: cross fraction guilds now, tomorrow cross fraction housing KEKW
[4:25:47] keeindordel: I was on horde and we had recruitment issues @Towelliee  LMFAO
[4:25:53] demonicyoshi: remove factions compeletly?
[4:25:57] raye_gaming22: my server alone has 20+ 11/11 guilds
[4:25:59] alex8ait: @Towelliee  cross faction and cross realm
[4:26:12] Masqerader: @KillzwitchTV no it will be terrible because there will be a strict meta for that content.
[4:26:14] NathanHiilll: Hi
[4:27:07] keeindordel: BUT WE DID
[4:27:10] keeindordel: for 2 tiers
[4:27:12] demonicyoshi: we do
[4:27:14] keeindordel: CN and SOD
[4:27:17] Scraggersmeh: The only ones who have problems are those with recruitment officers who aren't doing their job properly. @Towelliee
[4:27:19] happybooger: sure do
[4:27:33] raye_gaming22: bad guild do have problems maybe
[4:27:45] KillzwitchTV: @KillzwitchTV yeah but me if i wanna raid with friend whats the problem why blizz will limit people for that? honestly atm i dont even care about raidin i can get all my stuff from m+ but whatever man im happy in my minority just wich blizzard will do something for people who want to do mythic content without having to deal with recrutin all the time.
[4:27:51] nvnto: think it's maintaining a healthy 20 man roster for many guilds thats a problem.
[4:27:55] Scraggersmeh: If your recruitment officer isn't approaching every person on WoWprogress' looking for guild list that fit your bill, and approaching people in guilds around your progress level to get guys to come over, they aren't doing their job.

[4:34:23] TheItalianStallion321: i dont know i still loved the artifact weapon
[4:34:26] SensationalBanana: towCopium Awesome emote
[4:34:41] raye_gaming22: i mean the trees we have now cant get any worse some of our specs dont even use more than 1 layout for years aoe and st wise
[4:34:49] PvtHudson093: everyone did say the Cov abilities should have been a talent row
[4:34:54] NieIas: first time since WoD ( 8 years ) that we get new talents
[4:35:10] leebo1777: I think it’s more you lose it at the end of each expansion
[4:35:13] FranciscoTheMage: BREAK weak Aura
[4:35:14] user11214: WAYTOODANK
[4:35:16] bowsers1: I bet people will miss Borrowed powers in DF
[4:35:17] Shrapnel_Sponge: WA won't be much of a shit show, everyone will just use the same builds anyway LUL
[4:35:17] manmower: how are the sim programs gonna handle these?
[4:35:18] Masqerader: Preach and his fucking dice analogy in BFA is just gonna go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[4:35:20] TheCliffyShow: WoW fans are weird.
[4:35:21] quarantine_mike: DragonFlight is going to be a HUGE Flop
[4:35:22] Broomba: DF might break weak auras
[4:35:25] stoop_kid69: it will be nice to have abilities without the endless multipliers from cov and conduits
[4:35:30] Havocados: weakauras Pog
[4:35:37] Scraggersmeh: Wait till you have 30 WA just to track your passives
[4:35:40] zgag: Wowhead has an article mentioning July 14th for Alpha
[4:35:42] Buckwink: OHHHHHHHHHHHHH

[4:35:45] NieIas: KEKW
[4:35:48] zgag: Rumor
[4:35:48] Aquadriel: gottem
[4:35:49] LehBiscuit: LUL
[4:35:55] Robodope: i dont think weakauras tracking buffs is the problem but rather specifically the war between weakauras and boss mechanics
[4:35:56] CushyPop: Lol
[4:36:06] Broomba: towRekt
[4:36:26] Masqerader: ppl saying DF is a flop are the same kids who think classic is amazing but its a complete pushover
[4:36:34] Beutow: !ALPHA
[4:36:34] Moobot: @Beutow PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.

[4:37:00] silodin: get it away
[4:37:22] dec_u: assa only gets garrote by default
[4:37:23] Lamentz: asssassination does
[4:37:23] jumperul: only assa
[4:37:25] dec_u: outlaw gets blind
[4:37:25] c0mmander_starscream: RIP Paulie "Walnuts"
[4:37:25] Rottencoarse: nope
[4:37:26] dngrslythicc: based on spec
[4:37:27] Coleson54: different for each spec i think
[4:37:28] MistyValkyrie: you get it depending on the sepc
[4:37:30] MistyValkyrie: spec*
[4:37:31] Rottencoarse: assas get garrote by deafult
[4:37:32] Noulex: No only assa
[4:37:34] procyon_mfc: classes get a default talent yep top left
[4:37:35] CianoHD3: no its only assassination the top row changes per spec
[4:37:36] TheCliffyShow: Assassination rogues get garrote by default.
[4:37:43] chiftelutza080963: lol hes so "Smart" only asa get garrote
[4:37:46] noosphear: Certain specs get different abilities.  Assassanation gets Garrote.  Outlaw gets Blind.
[4:37:47] Marcel_ArteDesign: marcel3d subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[4:37:48] Noulex: Subt gets sap and outlaw blind from the start
[4:37:52] PvtHudson093: yes
[4:37:53] procyon_mfc: its a free point yah
[4:37:54] CianoHD3: yes
[4:37:55] Zivs: ya
[4:38:07] Aquadriel: yeah you want blind cause then you get Feint which is BiS
[4:38:08] cabalish: base
[4:38:10] erdls: you kinda need to point them to get 8 points so yh
[4:38:23] Dudutoolbox: so instead of making them default abilities are talents now?
[4:38:29] erdls: actually nvm y
[4:38:40] Rottencoarse: yeah sub gets it free
[4:38:44] qtla: Rogue tree is stupid
[4:38:58] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee I think with the amount of energy regeneation you can spec for you won't need thistle tea unless you go for pvp. I already saved a talent tree to test out :) but I see it being promising :D
[4:38:59] keeindordel: ALL ROGUES gets Echoing Reprimand (kyrian) ability
[4:39:06] Cafe0le: rogues have the best trees so op
[4:39:10] Dudutoolbox: shouldnt these be all base abilities tho instead of talents?
[4:39:15] VanishSHRoguE: @keeindordel if you spec into. Its not worth it for asass tbh
[4:39:17] Yagr6: @Towelliee The big deal is ass and combat have access to shadow dance
[4:39:26] Bogzeh: i dunno, base abilities shouldnt be moved to talents
[4:39:28] keeindordel: @VanishSHRoguE it is for pvp ;p
[4:39:33] Frank4LuLz: no combat
[4:39:35] Alaquane: kick is baseline for rogues
[4:39:35] Shrapnel_Sponge: rogue tree got a huge amount of utility, hunter seems shit by comparison imo
[4:39:36] keeindordel: @VanishSHRoguE echoingrepirmand with sepsis
[4:39:59] manmower: rogues had too many abilities, needed more baseline
[4:40:02] Snabido: Dont you have legs?
[4:40:03] erdls: cause rog is king of CC
[4:40:05] Frank4LuLz: this sis bull
[4:40:05] raye_gaming22: prob meele vs range kick
[4:40:07] NieIas: rogue privilege
[4:40:09] ForklyftTV: kick is an iconic rogue thing
[4:40:11] rbolude: i heard that they had too many abilities so they couldn't put it in the tree xD
[4:40:11] Radtvlol: seems like way too many talents are just 1 point talents for abilities
[4:40:12] Scraggersmeh: Raid.
[4:40:14] keeindordel: MYTHIC RAIDER
[4:40:16] Mathhbm: raider
[4:40:17] keeindordel: do raider
[4:40:19] Frank4LuLz: plus'er
[4:40:20] VanishSHRoguE: @keeindordel then its fine but you got better specs for PVE HANDS DOWN if you want the link of my saved spec let me know lol
[4:40:23] TompsonX: Heroic raider Pog
[4:40:26] Shrapnel_Sponge: maybe DK interrupt because it's ranged? maybe melee based ones like Pummel and Rebuke will be baseline?
[4:40:26] Ditysalad: not liking the trees atm cause there are things that should be baseline that aren't like interupts
[4:40:28] qtla: YTou should never have to spec in to kick. Thats just dumb
[4:40:29] c0mmander_starscream: Turbo Mythic Raider
[4:40:30] NickLeonhearth: set him up as a casual dad in his 40s @Towelliee
[4:40:40] Aquadriel: you WANT faint
[4:40:44] keeindordel: nah thts healers job @Towelliee
[4:40:45] halshuggen: you might want it?
[4:40:47] halshuggen: lol
[4:40:49] Ribastur0075: ye, too many abilities that used to be baseline is a talent now,, its a waste of talents in my opinion
[4:40:50] raye_gaming22: you need sap for claok
[4:40:54] keeindordel: NAH DONT TAKE FEINT let healers pump
[4:40:58] Keydepleto: you dont want sap but you want everything below it for raid
[4:41:17] TheCliffyShow: I hardly ever use tricks of the trade.
[4:41:22] Scraggersmeh: You want sap to get cloak
[4:41:22] Alaquane: cloak yes
[4:41:33] Airwaves_Gamer: cloak is a must
[4:41:40] keeindordel: CLOAK IS A MUST
[4:41:42] raye_gaming22: cheat death and cloak are on taht row oyu need to take it or you trolling ^^
[4:41:48] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  cloask is a must in raids
[4:41:51] Aquadriel: yes
[4:41:54] rbolude: its only magic tho
[4:42:01] Buckwink: think of these trees more as loadouts
[4:42:04] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee cloak leads to tricks you want it lol
[4:42:24] Keydepleto: cloak can be used for dps gain if you play it right and the fight allow it

[4:42:31] raye_gaming22: still need it for cheat death xD
[4:42:37] keeindordel: NO WOUND POIOSN
[4:42:40] keeindordel: WOUND POISON IS FOR PVP
[4:42:51] TheCliffyShow: I hate that cheat death is so far down.
[4:43:09] akaari5486: Yo rogues,does it look good so far ? im hunt player,but glad if you like it
[4:43:11] Buckwink: sometiems you get one shot KEKW
[4:43:33] keeindordel: adds
[4:43:36] halshuggen: works on anduin adds
[4:43:47] Scraggersmeh: You need shadowstep otherwise you're trolling
[4:43:47] bigoldmeatpie: everyone gets shadowsteeeep
[4:43:53] Scraggersmeh: You -have- to go down the sap line.
[4:43:54] TheCliffyShow: Might be good for soloing or mythic+ adds.
[4:44:01] keeindordel: @Towelliee  wound poison jsut reduces healing received its for pvp
[4:44:25] abracka_: they have a poison now that reduces or increases dmg taken by the target
[4:44:26] Folgrum: rogue talends are great. most are 1 points, good variations. hunter talens sux, most are 2-3 points. alot of core talents are now not obtainable. sadge
[4:44:28] Mathhbm: sap line is better than blind one tbh, you get cloak, shadowstep and subterfuge
[4:44:44] avgjohnson52: you have to have the prereqs to go down not just 8
[4:44:47] Zivs: its pretty big yea
[4:44:50] keeindordel: YES
[4:44:51] Scraggersmeh: It's absolutely necessary.
[4:44:55] keeindordel: u can shadowstep to ur allies too
[4:44:55] Keydepleto: yup
[4:44:56] Scraggersmeh: You lose so much dps running like a peasant.
[4:44:57] raye_gaming22: every rouge has to had the right side skilled
[4:44:59] keeindordel: its mobility
[4:45:00] Zivs: look what you need to unlock further down too
[4:45:01] noosphear: Depends on the mobility reqs of a fight.
[4:45:02] TheCliffyShow: Weird that shadowstep is in both the rogue tree and assassination tree.
[4:45:06] Yagr6: u take it
[4:45:21] Yagr6: run the mechanic out than shadow step to the boss
[4:45:21] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[4:45:30] goretera: that is just a extra charge of shadowstep. the actual spell is in the spec tree
[4:45:44] keeindordel: THTS FOR PVP
[4:45:52] keeindordel: lol
[4:45:56] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee if you want a direct tree of optimal single target that is not for pvp I've made one :)
[4:46:38] keeindordel: virulent

[4:47:06] Olieburgz: you're going to want Shadow Dance no matter what
[4:47:09] keeindordel: but cheat death D:
[4:47:18] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee you take both
[4:47:18] keeindordel: nah
[4:47:28] keeindordel: sin should have all its damage come from poisons
[4:47:29] NieIas: asmond watching ur clip LUL
[4:47:35] xXSiebzehnXx: Shadow dance would be amazing if the garrote spam is still available for assassination
[4:47:36] Araxiwow: u going shadow dance on all specs
[4:47:51] VanishSHRoguE: @Araxiwow you really aren't lol
[4:47:54] NieIas: that u cant talk about signing a potential nda
[4:48:03] keeindordel: must have
[4:48:19] splash_mm: yo @towelliee can u tell me what is the best tank class?
[4:48:21] pietdepie: halo does the aplha maybe begin today?
[4:48:24] keeindordel: good for adds and pvp
[4:48:30] Killaabeez: having shadow dance with assa tree that seems good isnt it ?
[4:48:31] Thoreya: LUL
[4:48:42] keeindordel: @Killaabeez ye
[4:48:43] manmower: get marked
[4:48:49] cripplious: it sounds like a convoluted pain the ass
[4:48:50] Winnie_theBro: Give that tree the ole wraparound 😉
[4:48:52] keeindordel: COLD BLOOD
[4:48:57] Scraggersmeh: Get cold blood then stop that side.
[4:49:06] senex_y: i would go for 6 combo points
[4:49:14] Olieburgz: You would want Cold Blood then go down to Shadow Dance
[4:49:22] raye_gaming22: full right side like i sayd xD cheat death and weakness is a must have
[4:49:22] keeindordel: get cold blood and stop there
[4:49:36] keeindordel: @chizu_gaming just doge mechanics 5 head
[4:49:37] FranciscoTheMage: THIS IS MY whole problem with this revamp @Towelliee it is fucking overwhelming. enough to make people not even want to play
[4:49:41] VanishSHRoguE: @Scraggersmeh that side with SF + vigor is a must. The class tree, just doens't need you as assass to go into thistle echoing or dance. You can spec where you have seal fate, vigor + deeper strategem
[4:49:44] FranciscoTheMage: why are they doing this
[4:49:49] emznev: THIS is pretty cool ngl
[4:49:57] Thoreya: @FranciscoTheMage lol wut
[4:49:57] Detonite: Compared to Vanilla this is what brainmelt looks like
[4:50:08] keeindordel: cheat death is for ppl tht cant mitigate damage or do mechanics properly Kappa
[4:50:15] raye_gaming22: told ya and the talent below CD is a must too
[4:50:18] akia03: you need that anyway to get dance
[4:50:24] FranciscoTheMage: if they want new players and new generations to come into playing WOW ..THIS .. is NOT the way
[4:50:34] keeindordel: yes and no
[4:50:38] emznev: @FranciscoTheMage bro come on now lol
[4:50:41] keeindordel: could just stack haste to compensate
[4:50:45] rymerre: good...fuck cheat death
[4:50:46] senex_y: thistle tea is better imo
[4:50:47] abracka_: this is the way tho, what they've been doing has not worked
[4:50:48] DeanoTV: @FranciscoTheMage these are better than current trees
[4:50:49] Thoreya: kyrian ability
[4:50:52] Killaabeez: @FranciscoTheMage bro wow needs big changes like this
[4:50:52] Frank4LuLz: rogues suck anyways...pallys for life
[4:50:53] akia03: kyrian cov
[4:50:54] noosphear: Kyrian ability.
[4:50:54] Cafe0le: @FranciscoTheMage LOL
[4:50:55] Keydepleto: depends on the build you are going, but vigor is pretty big yeah
[4:50:56] CianoHD3: Kyrian Cov abilityu
[4:50:57] VanishSHRoguE: @akia03 you don't want it for dance, ur generation of dmg, is enevenom, rupture, garrote and poisons, ambush is too lack luster as assass
[4:51:00] FranciscoTheMage: its over the top
[4:51:04] keeindordel: u hit it and everytime u get tht combo it = as 7 combo points
[4:51:04] FranciscoTheMage: its ridiculous
[4:51:07] Sielu11628: @franciscothemage what’s the difference between these “new” trees and playing Vanilla in 2004 with absolutely NO builds online telling you what to choose. You learn, and you copy
[4:51:10] TheCliffyShow: My least favorite rogue covenant ability.
[4:51:12] martyn47: this is just way OTT, isn't it
[4:51:14] Alaquane: kyrian
[4:51:21] emznev: @FranciscoTheMage do your research it aint that hard honestly
[4:51:30] rbolude: @FranciscoTheMage people gonna copy paste builds like in any other game relax KEKW
[4:51:38] FranciscoTheMage: pfft the people they want playing the game dont do research
[4:51:41] Detonite: imaging never played wow and face this :/
[4:51:46] FranciscoTheMage: maybe older players do
[4:51:50] keeindordel: thts a pvp thing
[4:51:53] Cafe0le: @FranciscoTheMage dont think you play many games if you think that
[4:51:54] Thoreya: @FranciscoTheMage people are gonna go to wowhead regardless doesnt matter LUL LUL
[4:52:00] Alaquane: one of your combo point nuggets turns blue, if you have that nugget charged, it counts as a 7 point finisher instead of whatever it is
[4:52:01] DeanoTV: these trees are better than current trees chat
[4:52:03] martyn47: thistle tea in the talents!? xD
[4:52:03] Yagr6: assa and combat having the ability to take shadow dance is nuts
[4:52:04] Alienfromger: cmon ist not nearly complex as poe
[4:52:05] Dystilled: Youd be surprised how much people like minmaxing.
[4:52:11] keeindordel: @Thoreya true
[4:52:13] letrickyxd: @Detonite I can, just google :)
[4:52:13] FranciscoTheMage: more group think
[4:52:17] FranciscoTheMage: sad
[4:52:17] TheCliffyShow: thistle tea used to be a consumble now it's an ability.
[4:52:20] erdls: if you never plyed wow you get 2 points per lvl so you slowly learn
[4:52:32] keeindordel: @Towelliee  one of your combo point nuggets turns blue, if you have that nugget charged, it counts as a 7 point finisher instead of whatever it is thts echoing reprimand
[4:52:37] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee the way I specced I managed to get deeper strategem, vigor and full seal fate. The final row for assass I think its too weak on the general kilt. Thistle tea is not worth when you'll get a crap ton of energy from assass tree
[4:52:37] Sielu11628: It’s 2022. People are gonna google it. No one is sitting there thinking, “Hmm…do I choose x, y, z”
[4:52:39] Buckwink: just git gud
[4:52:39] keeindordel: YA NO CHEAT DEATH
[4:52:42] keeindordel: do mechanics
[4:52:42] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee you won't need it tbh
[4:52:42] Scraggersmeh: Yes you need CD to get to Shadow dance.
[4:52:44] keeindordel: Kappa
[4:52:45] Thoreya: i wish i can tell ya i dont play rogue
[4:52:52] oi_keana: ya but rouge
[4:52:53] Alaquane: healers adjust
[4:52:53] Frank4LuLz: do your job
[4:52:56] raye_gaming22: gid kicked out of the raid xD
[4:52:57] Sudocomm: this is like old tree before it got reworked cause people whined that it "too hard" and went full thud going me thunk to hard for point for where go duh
[4:53:03] Mathhbm: but you need shadow dance
[4:53:03] paravak: @Detonite People probably would have said the same thing about talent trees back in vanilla/tbc, and here we all are, nearly 19 years later
[4:53:05] martyn47: as we went from mortal heroes in Vanilla, to god slayers in Retail - thistle tea went from a simple drink anyone could make - to a final row talent? Madness
[4:53:05] CodyKane: i mean for progression, but other then that nah i would say cheat death is useless
[4:53:06] VanishSHRoguE: @Scraggersmeh unless ur pvping shadowdance is absolute useless for assass lol
[4:53:09] jumperul: you need shadow dance
[4:53:12] DeanoTV: @cumium we neede this for new better changes
[4:53:14] keeindordel: YES
[4:53:16] oi_keana: ya
[4:53:16] Thoreya: its good yeah
[4:53:16] Frank4LuLz: garbage
[4:53:16] Alaquane: it's okay
[4:53:18] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee its not good for assass
[4:53:19] Thoreya: for outlaw at least
[4:53:21] ScoobieRoo: i like itt
[4:53:25] keeindordel: imagien doing a 7 combo strike at 2 combo points @Towelliee
[4:53:28] Buckwink: BM Hunter pet build is nuts
[4:53:29] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee I m raid
[4:53:35] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee its trash lol for asass
[4:53:37] Thoreya: they already talkedl ol
[4:53:37] Mathhbm: shadow dance is a must, so you go all the way sap line
[4:53:37] Buckwink: @Towelliee he did yesterday
[4:53:38] erdls: they did it alrdy
[4:53:38] Alaquane: I think they did that yesterday
[4:53:38] ursinealli: they did last night
[4:53:39] Zivs: they did that last night actually LUL
[4:53:39] akia03: its outlaws best isnt it now
[4:53:40] kingxjzeus: they already did
[4:53:40] Thoreya: yesterday
[4:53:41] rbolude: they already did
[4:53:42] raye_gaming22: they did one
[4:53:43] Frank4LuLz: im a mythic healing rogu, got my bandages
[4:53:46] kingxjzeus: JPC loves it
[4:53:54] erdls: he doesnt
[4:53:56] Mecabeast: it got nerfed heavy in  s1
[4:53:57] Rekiick: No
[4:54:00] rbolude: nop
[4:54:01] Olieburgz: He didn't no
[4:54:01] Keydepleto: kyrian is for sub and outlaw, sin is all about poisons not finishing moves
[4:54:02] nemesis981: he went for shadow dance
[4:54:03] Thoreya: jpc was like a little kid on christmas morning yesterdya
[4:54:04] Yagr6: @Towelliee Assa and combat specs now have access to shadow dance which before was only available to sub

[5:16:49] oneifbyland: @manmower there's aren't any decision nodes. the guy that made this was in Max's chat last night answering questinos
[5:16:51] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee it'll be like that
[5:16:51] pavepawns: hunter has
[5:16:52] bubblesthebelfwarrior: Hunter has
[5:16:52] Neruan: hunter do tho
[5:16:53] Buckwink: BM
[5:16:54] Cafe0le: SUBLAW POGGERS
[5:16:55] ursinealli: pretty sure there are come choice nodes for hunter
[5:17:01] manmower: if combos are too strong, they put those abilities in decision nodes
[5:17:01] Consor: yes they do
[5:17:05] Rawoosh: Surv had in middle
[5:17:05] akia03: yes they do
[5:17:05] pavepawns: they do
[5:17:06] Contendedlemon: they dids
[5:17:07] pavepawns: u just saw them
[5:17:08] newkingcody: survival does
[5:17:09] Contendedlemon: you missed it
[5:17:09] bubblesthebelfwarrior: Lol they do
[5:17:12] Alaquane: survival does
[5:17:13] ShowDUH: Hunter has choice node
[5:17:15] senex_y: hunter has them
[5:17:18] Alaquane: butcher vs carve
[5:17:23] TheCliffyShow: @DeanoTV Subtlety get the venthyr one, flagellation.
[5:17:33] Jokervenom1978: BM has a bunch
[5:17:37] keeindordel: survival u can choose form going to a full rnage dot build or melee build
[5:17:37] GnasherReign: how about killer cobra vs our current bm lego

[5:17:57] bubblesthebelfwarrior: Some classes need the pick from one to other vs other classes need both?
[5:18:11] oneifbyland: @Towelliee  the guy that made these was in Max's chat last night. he said it's just a first iteration but there are purposely no "choice" nodes
[5:18:11] akia03: all 1 point talents tho hunter its all 3 point ones
[5:18:26] keeindordel: must need
[5:18:35] Worgenrunt01: @happybooger blobDance thank you for the sub
[5:18:53] Thoreya: playing without roll the bones would be interesting
[5:18:59] happybooger: @Worgenrunt01 slootLove
[5:19:22] Rulem: If other classes do not have similar raid buffs, I think you will want 1 outlaw and 1 sin rogue in your raid
[5:19:23] F3rr3t: grappling hook owns
[5:19:30] Zivs: @grissomG you have a timestamp for that? I watched most but must have missed that
[5:19:32] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  in pvp or pve?
[5:19:35] chrslp: I imagine grappling hook is better in PVP
[5:19:37] Snabido: Depends whats under evasion I guess
[5:19:47] Rulem: the CDR is like 15-20sec/min reduction
[5:19:50] TheCliffyShow: Well, with shadowstep available to all rogues, it's not necessary. But, it's still really fun.
[5:19:54] pigvmt: you can have a shadowstep from the rogue tree
[5:19:58] chrslp: yea pvp
[5:20:03] oneifbyland: @Zivs timestamp no sorry but it was toward the end of stream before he jumped into his raid
[5:20:15] Zivs: okok ty
[5:20:37] Rulem: you will go straight down the middle
[5:20:37] amkttv: CDR is too good to pass up
[5:20:38] TheCliffyShow: With grappling hook able to be placed manualyl and not to an enemy, it has it's uses over shadowstep.
[5:20:47] Rulem: for the raid CDR
[5:20:59] chrslp: Man its gonna be rough minmaxing talents for DF KEKW
[5:21:15] keeindordel: @chrslp nah jsut wait for wowhead to post kekw
[5:21:25] Rulem: for ST I think you take grappling to get to the ambush talents
[5:21:36] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:22:26] amkttv: oh nice, they added the legion artifact ability
[5:22:33] Rulem: that one stacks with the rogue one for a 6yd range lol
[5:22:40] Jokervenom1978: Is Dreadblades artifact ability?
[5:22:52] amkttv: yeps from legion
[5:23:07] F3rr3t: I feel like the ambush talents are good

[5:23:28] Rulem: yeah, I think the ambush build will be really strong for outlaw
[5:24:05] Aphro_Samurai: main gaux*
[5:24:13] Aphro_Samurai: geaux*
[5:24:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: This is looking like a PvP build
[5:24:27] Alaquane: go
[5:24:32] Rulem: yeah
[5:24:33] keeindordel: yes
[5:24:36] keeindordel: it is
[5:24:36] akia03: yep
[5:24:37] Aphro_Samurai: believe it's french
[5:24:44] Aphro_Samurai: Nd yes it is
[5:24:48] oneifbyland: go-sh yea
[5:25:00] amkttv: isn't main gauche outlaw's mastery?
[5:25:01] yerusss: @Aphro_Samurai It is, prononciation is go-che
[5:25:04] Blackminuz: damn rogue going to be insane!
[5:25:06] eccoo: you skipped the middle skill
[5:25:12] Effin_Steffin: Main Goshe. The O is a hard O. French for "Left hand"

[5:26:04] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @psychuck87 (warning)
[5:26:20] qtla: @Towelliee Did you read outlaw raid buff
[5:26:53] oneifbyland: keep it rolling EZ
[5:27:00] Rulem: legendary
[5:27:03] wEiRdO_dUdE: 5 minute cooldown is some boomer shit LUL
[5:27:17] qtla: Next to blade rush
[5:27:19] Zivs: the cdr stuff
[5:27:19] Rulem: middle
[5:27:24] akia03: next to blade rush
[5:27:25] mario_banshee: middle, 3rd from bottom
[5:27:47] wEiRdO_dUdE: That one is big, potentially
[5:27:48] keeindordel: POGGERS
[5:27:52] keeindordel: outlaw manditory
[5:27:58] ShowDUH: i mean it's another windfury
[5:28:02] manmower: sims can't handle this load
[5:28:05] keeindordel: they build combo points fast
[5:28:06] aniboul: 5 rogue in i raid
[5:28:08] Rulem: going off current numbers, its about 15 seconds every minute
[5:28:08] keeindordel: melee group
[5:28:12] Artiiz: its like 20 sec per min
[5:28:15] oneifbyland: windfury but cdr instead of attackspeed
[5:28:16] bubblesthebelfwarrior: The guy in maxes stream said prob 20sec off  each minute
[5:28:22] Buckwink: its like windfury totem right?
[5:28:26] amkttv: what if you stack rogues in a party?
[5:28:30] PvtHudson093: melee group along with an enhancement shaman
[5:28:33] countrycount: apparently around 20s cdr per minute
[5:28:37] Rulem: 15-20 sec
[5:28:39] cloutzor: how do you feel about party buffs vs raid buffs
[5:28:41] magemaster225: the assasin rogue DR is better
[5:28:42] Yagr6: outlaw enhance triple warrior
[5:28:47] keeindordel: fight over the outlaw rogue guild drama poggers
[5:28:47] raye_gaming22: its abour 22 -20sec crd on a 2 min
[5:28:48] oneifbyland: windfury doesn't stack so this prob wont
[5:28:57] bubblesthebelfwarrior: 1 outlaw pre party lol
[5:29:02] Artiiz: Are you excited for the protection paladin talents
[5:29:05] phinoxrgp: im gonna nwait for the experts to put out a talent tree lol
[5:29:06] bubblesthebelfwarrior: Tbc times shaman lol
[5:29:10] Rulem: probably more since you will likely take both deeper strats and ambush 3cp talent
[5:29:15] ShowDUH: we had a 5min dausegne and assuming our outlaw had that, he would have gotten 63.4 sec off of a major CD
[5:29:15] whiteknight657: its going to change before the live version comes out
[5:29:27] akia03: depends if you gun builld or ambush build
[5:29:35] oneifbyland: Ace Up Sleeve was good in BfA
[5:30:03] oneifbyland: choices EZ
[5:30:07] manmower: there should be a randomize talents button
[5:30:09] Rulem: ambush 3cp + dance + dispatcher = tons of CDR
[5:30:16] keeindordel: RMP ON STEROIDS
[5:30:17] TheCliffyShow: Name one "Bleed Like a Stuffed Pig".
[5:30:19] keeindordel: POGGIES
[5:30:24] akia03: wished they added  the gun stuff to surv and remove the melee atacks for the gun ones
[5:30:29] yerusss: The CDR with dreadblade can be fun, 7combo point every gcd is 1.4 secs to the party right ?
[5:30:30] Artiiz: should make it so you can save different talent trees, just like with Equipment Manager
[5:30:40] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think a recommended button is a good idea, yeah
[5:30:44] noosphear: Some default loadouts already loaded.
[5:30:44] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[5:30:45] chrslp: Ooo I just saw that the white house announced Tesla superchargers in the US are going to be usable by non-Teslas by the end of this year. That'll make road trips in my mach e way easier
[5:30:52] Bogzeh: they need build presets are they adding that in?
[5:30:54] Rulem: @Artiiz they are
[5:30:58] Artiiz: thats awesome
[5:30:59] Snabido: Especially if they want to target new players
[5:31:01] keeindordel: CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW REXTROY VIDEOS
[5:31:02] ziphertv: !alpha
[5:31:02] Moobot: @realzipher PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:31:05] Connectus: Raid spec, m+ spec, meme spec 1, meme spec 2, meme spec 69 (for the memiest spec ofcourse) Kappa
[5:31:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: I've seen "suggested talent paths" used in other games. Rift, I think
[5:31:18] mario_banshee: a "import top dps log tree" button Kappa
[5:31:27] Zivs: @Bogzeh there are yea
[5:31:29] FranciscoTheMage: this is complete and total mess for new players
[5:31:32] manmower: they do seem like Rift talent trees, which were fun
[5:31:36] FranciscoTheMage: people they trying to attract
[5:31:37] Poriand: this will be overhelming for new players
[5:31:48] Rawoosh: I mean, they should just pick what sounds the coolest
[5:31:49] Artiiz: There's so much stuff you have no idea what they are or how they work
[5:31:50] merp___: These talent systems are absolutely overwhelming for new players
[5:31:51] cloutzor: new players in 2022?
[5:31:51] ziphertv: they can just google Kappa
[5:31:54] cahoots82: This isn't that complicated. It's not like people who play wow have never played an RPG or MMO before.
[5:32:01] oneifbyland: @Bogzeh in screenshots there were "pages" visible (think rune pages in League if you know that game) so ppl are speculating yes
[5:32:05] amkttv: I think what wow is missing rn is the opportunity to fail, makes it so much more satisfying when you do it right
[5:32:05] chrslp: New players more likely to use things like Zygor which give you talent guidance
[5:32:07] FranciscoTheMage: for the game to survive they need new players.
[5:32:09] Buckwink: sub is fun KEKW

[5:32:11] TheCliffyShow: I've mained rogue my whole WoW career. And, I'm still overwhelmed.
[5:32:23] FranciscoTheMage: when they enter into the world of MSFT they need to be able to attract players
[5:32:24] HonestPhilosophy: Wor st case they hit up icyveins or something, this makes me want to try every class
[5:32:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: The best sub rogues are sneaky and evil LUL
[5:32:29] FranciscoTheMage: THIS IS NOT THE WAY
[5:32:30] akia03: sub tree is really wierd
[5:32:35] merp___: the vast majority of wow players are turbo casuals who don't look at guides, and with the current talent systems they still manage to pick terrible things. This new tree system is going to allow people to create the WORST builds.
[5:32:37] monarchist96: i just started wow and mostly because of these trees be introduced. i mostly play poe though, so i like the idea of messsing around with builds
[5:32:39] Poriand: sub is basically how sub is now
[5:32:39] TheCliffyShow: Subtlety is my least favorite rogue spec.
[5:32:42] oneifbyland: LUL
[5:32:46] LongSnapper99: Sub rogue is so confusing to me lol
[5:32:50] Subtlety_FL: sub = burst. All about lock down combos and burst
[5:32:55] Snabido: Noxxic still exists? Lol
[5:33:18] toobaked1987: WoW balancing team gonna have a tough time sleeping during DF. What a nightmare this is gonna be
[5:33:51] bitman_gaming: as a UX designer I think a recommended button would be great. Easily doable as long as Blizzard allows the UI devs time to develop.
[5:33:52] senex_y: i went straight down the middle for this one
[5:34:24] tornbraclet: i stopped playing sub rogue after they removed hemorage

[5:36:35] procyon_mfc: NNF
[5:36:37] Mortis301: pop tricks of the trade then go nuts with shadow dance in MDI

[5:37:06] keeindordel: yes
[5:37:13] Loonytic: it wa sin the game befroe
[5:37:25] manmower: apocalypse
[5:37:26] keeindordel: it was in Legion and BFA
[5:37:28] Buckwink: the yellow bastard
[5:37:43] Mortis301: night crawler? not a villain
[5:37:58] keeindordel: night crawler from xmen is a good guy
[5:38:10] akia03: ya thats what i thought of when i saw it night crawler
[5:38:38] dinomiyte: towCopium
[5:38:54] manmower: it's the Wo power from mythics
[5:38:57] keeindordel: for mythic+
[5:39:09] amkttv: Only for M+ or PVP
[5:39:11] keeindordel: tht too
[5:39:25] TheCliffyShow: Wo as a talent.
[5:39:25] keeindordel: shroud is disabled in rated pvp
[5:39:38] Neruan: ?? you can use it fine in bossfights
[5:39:57] akia03: can you swap on the fly or you need a rested area to switch?
[5:40:02] keeindordel: @Neruan u cant be stealthe dif ur already in combat
[5:40:03] amkttv: will it be in DF too? seems stupid to give talents for it but then disable it where it matters!!
[5:40:29] Neruan: @Neruan shadowdance???
[5:40:30] TheCliffyShow: Yeah, I've seen plenty of rogues, like myself, use shroud to allow the raid to set up closer for a boss pull.
[5:40:34] Zivs: im no brewmaster
[5:40:49] pigvmt: poison becomes shadow and do more damage
[5:42:58] Zivs: The right one is the Venthyr ability i believe

[5:44:09] c0mmander_starscream: @Towelliee is it a good time to come back to WoW? I've been gone since Legion
[5:44:13] TheCliffyShow: Why couldn't assassination get that instead of lame ass subtlety?
[5:44:18] Poriand: outlaw seems best
[5:44:18] vengeanceee7: Outlaw
[5:44:19] senex_y: sub looks good

[5:44:40] Mortis301: I've played assassination since BC
[5:44:41] magemaster225: kinda weird its the only set of trees so far without choice nodes
[5:44:50] Alaquane: raid takes less damage, can cut a healer maybe? or the healers can dps more?
[5:44:55] Cafe0le: assa is super boring
[5:45:13] Zivs: KEKW
[5:45:14] ambiotic: the 3% dr with improved poison is going to be nuts
[5:45:17] Cafe0le: at least these past expansions
[5:45:26] endobleedz: its about 20sec per 1min
[5:45:29] vengeanceee7: 3 % dmg can become 7 when you empower the poisons with the other talent btw
[5:45:34] jumperul: with shiv gets to 7%
[5:45:35] vengeanceee7: 6.5 to be exact
[5:45:36] blumberquack: I like the tiny toxic blade LUL
[5:45:38] magemaster225: with the extra buffs it getszs up to 7.2% DR
[5:45:38] akia03: does the damage reduc stack tho with devo aura and such
[5:45:42] shuunno: you done with lost ark? :) @Towelliee

[5:46:05] Mortis301: @TheCliffyShow So would it be the Ass Master spec?
[5:46:07] Sluggs_: shiv doubles it
[5:46:25] vengeanceee7: So when u taking heavy raid deeps u can reduce by 7 %
[5:46:29] johnzohead: johnzohead subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 69 months! hi towelliee.
[5:46:41] Alaquane: applying a concentrated form of your non-lethal poison
[5:46:49] Sluggs_: concentrated form of your poisons
[5:46:55] blumberquack: It concentrates it
[5:46:56] TheCliffyShow: @Mortis301 Yes
[5:47:16] vengeanceee7: yes
[5:47:20] magemaster225: in the base rogue tree it increases non lethal by 20% and then you double it

[5:47:39] vengeanceee7: 30 sec
[5:47:42] TweakT: imagine taking awaye talent trees, smoking themme and bringing them back 10 years later
[5:47:43] gold9871: 30 sec
[5:47:53] ofnaldreya: Its shiv + the bonus from Master Poisoner in the general tree
[5:47:56] vengeanceee7: But as outlaw imagine 4 fire mages = perma combust
[5:48:08] manmower: anytime there is big incoming tank dmg, the rogue will shiv for you
[5:48:38] cloutzor: going back to wotlk tricks of the trade lol
[5:48:40] Zivs: throw me a shiv
[5:48:40] falldrgn: smoke bomb was a thing?
