[3:03:09] coffeexcakez: @InkdAdam have you thought about using mouse wheel for party 1 and 2 up and down?
[3:03:19] waterfeesh: Lets go king
[3:03:37] coffeexcakez: @Mavely took me a little to force it, then it became natural
[3:04:15] DevobotOCE: so happy this broken ass rdru spec is getting nerfed man
[3:04:30] InkdAdam: @coffeexcakez yeah but that‚Äôs my arena target and I already use shift binds for other skills (tried swapping them but then I‚Äôm bad on deeps)

[3:05:50] Melkiorx: lets do some 3s!
[3:05:51] brevillance_: @DevobotOCE 5% on 100k is 5k, thats hardly going to matter in the grand scheme of things
[3:05:55] tonjuras: i would enjoy some 3s
[3:05:58] coffeexcakez: leaving the stream up for the content for the cats
[3:06:00] DNEED4SPEED: are the hotfixes in?

[3:06:18] yzanamitv: Choo Chooo HypeLick solid ques
[3:06:19] kondal13: hey cdw said "pika is unfair in solo Suffel"
[3:06:22] DevobotOCE: 5% off of every instance of healing, it will add up especially into dampening
[3:06:31] brevillance_: @DevobotOCE yeah, but a lot of their healing is small, 10k or 15k, and 5% on that is so minor it doesnt even matter
