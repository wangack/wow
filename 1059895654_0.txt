[0:54:15] Shrenko: watched your FF14 VOD from yesterday and I got sad when the Exarch revealed himself and you didnt know who it was PepeHands @Towelliee
[0:54:23] chefjayare: Bet, can't wait
[0:55:06] chefjayare: thats a vendetta, love to see it
[0:55:26] hildebrandyr: He was an NPC from the original 24-man raid series, the Crystal Tower raids
[0:55:40] Shrenko: you missed Crystal Tower. Its a chain of raid quests that explains the tower and the Exarch
[0:55:59] hildebrandyr: because of that they started making it mandatory to do crystal tower for newer characters now
[0:56:01] fewyn: crystal tower used to be optional, i think it's now required in FFXIV?
[0:56:02] Nokterian: Good day from the eu @Towelliee
[0:56:10] Shrenko: its worth doing it!
[0:56:12] rosina_scarlett: do you have the weapon from thrallmar exalted?
[0:56:26] Shinjuro: fewyn yeah otherwise you dont progress in the story
[0:56:46] Nokterian: I see Balance Druids changing from NF to Venthyr
[0:56:52] Shrenko: @fewyn it is still optional but its still like ''required'' to do before Shadowbringers
[0:57:02] Shrenko: for story purposes
[0:57:38] geokouts: i will have fun progressing to get flying :P
[0:57:39] Thunderbrew: I hate the Maw. Can't play Shadowlands.

[1:08:49] Zettabyte: mine is under way @Towelliee :)
[1:09:10] JerBoody: From the streams I’ve watched, it seems like the biggest problem people have in gruuls right now is keeping the mage tank and the ogre king tank alive
[1:09:26] Frank4LuLz: no gpu's, no cpu's, no ram

[1:42:06] bigred_3: some people just need to bitch at blizz or they shrivel up and die
[1:42:13] sylvancrest: Where'd the "It's not ready" thing come from? Everything I've read and seen the last week has been "Hey, this patch seems really ready, where's the official release announcement?"
[1:42:34] Nokterian: GPU prices are finally going down slowly i see on diverse dutch websites
[1:42:46] snichy: With the delay of the Sylvanas book until February, I guess we can be pretty sure 9.2 will come end of Jan 2022...!
[1:43:03] Kinghorn: they wont :)
[1:43:09] sylvancrest: Ehh, I never raid day1. Too much of a filthy casual. :P

[1:44:37] luckfore: but they told you july would be optimistic right :O
[1:44:46] sylvancrest: Exactly, lol. Frankly . . . I kinda wouldn't mind a much more closed or NDA ptr with buggier releases, but way less leaks.

[1:47:08] bigred_3: im looking forward to it tho but might be a bit strange going from tbc feral tank to DH tank each week
[1:47:09] dracullus: @Inharmonix find something that "people" were NOT pissed about
[1:47:26] sylvancrest: Is this heroic or normal?
[1:47:51] JerBoody: Normal
[1:48:01] Iver_monk: Yah plus I think the early access starts next month

[2:14:02] ForgottnHero21: @Towelliee illl do mech
[2:14:15] infinitrus: 9.2 will be next year at this rate tho lol
[2:14:17] ShadyWizWolf: I don't think 9.3 will be a thing.
[2:14:21] aeyt: if its not a super long wait for next expac id be fine with no 9.3
[2:14:26] ShadyWizWolf: I need normal Bot. lol
[2:14:37] infinitrus: i would rather have a 9.3
[2:15:04] infinitrus: they should just delay the next expac
[2:15:08] Rudric_Ice: what if they delay the next expansion ?
[2:15:10] Wrizzik: Is BT live with this version of TBC, or are they adding later?
[2:15:12] ColdChillXI: Think blizz needs to rethink releases
[2:15:18] Avinar: cataclysm:death Kappa
[2:15:22] ShadyWizWolf: 9.0 - Sire, 9.1 - Slyvanas, 9.2 - Jailer (?), 9.3 - ?!

[2:15:44] MetalHeadTwo: MacallanTwoFive subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:15:48] Avinar: maybe that's why it was delayed so much? they realized they couldn't push out a 9.3 so shuffled stuff around? @Towelliee
[2:15:59] cabalish: 9.3 anduin !?
[2:16:02] Nokterian: New Expansion will be announced this or next year
[2:16:14] ShadyWizWolf: I say next year @Nokterian
[2:16:22] ColdChillXI: They need more time lol
[2:16:26] Boozehound: They won't allow blizz to wait that long for a new expansion
[2:16:27] ghostpwner87: 😇🙏😆
[2:16:34] mmrghost7: then SL is gonna be another wod
[2:16:42] Rudric_Ice: i guess they end with 9.2 then
[2:17:00] nerdtopia: 9.2 in november, 9.3 in april 2020 10.0 in august 2022 @Towelliee
[2:17:05] DramaticTv: we are gonna have 9.1 til feb-march, then 9.2 til thanksgivign most likely
[2:17:26] ShadyWizWolf: Needs 3 Shamans Kappa oh wait, i don't think I'm Heroic ready. KEKW
[2:17:37] Daggerdi3: How do you feel about 80 levels of renown?
[2:17:42] Nokterian: S.E.L.F.I.E cam was 6.1
[2:17:45] Nokterian: LUL
[2:17:45] Daggerdi3: Also Morning everyone!
[2:17:49] Megadisaster24: Sounds like you're challenging them to a worse expansion
[2:17:50] ShadyWizWolf: WoD could've been so much more PepeHands SO MUCH MORE.
[2:17:56] Jeraiya2: LUL
[2:17:58] mrblond5: No way
[2:17:59] Kinghorn: LUL
[2:18:06] Kinghorn: no fucking way, 9.2 in 2022
[2:18:07] ShadyWizWolf: Nada.
[2:18:14] Avinar: I think that's why we had this MASSIVE delay, to mess with something
[2:18:17] Bayne77: He's convinced! D:
[2:18:23] ColdChillXI: how are they working on another expansion rn lol
[2:18:24] Grock: @Towelliee they need to hire more devs tbh, same thing happened with bfa on release
[2:18:30] cabalish: yes, bliizard back at office, all back to normal
[2:18:45] Boozehound: I would've said a 2021 release of 9.2 would be possible if we had seen or heard anything about it. Nada. No way is it coming in 2021.
[2:18:45] jeneraljelly: Heroic Arc slaps
[2:18:55] Bulgogiprince: I honestly feel that will never happen again. People will be mostly hybrid WFH/Office
[2:18:58] nerdtopia: COVID and having to do remote work probably fucked with the scheduling of slands
[2:19:02] ShadyWizWolf: In the words of Illidan, "Boldy said, but I remain unconvinced."
[2:19:10] jason_tacey: Arc heroic..iirc...last boss sucks ass
[2:19:11] Megadisaster24: Feels like 20
[2:19:11] nerdtopia: stuff is normal again i think they can get back on scheduele
[2:19:12] Wrizzik: man, I didn't expect watching TBC streams to hit so hard on nostalgia
[2:19:13] uhtred_gaming: @Towelliee  or chat do you know if they are resetting valor or are we keeping what we currently have?
[2:19:39] Avinar: I'm so much better at working from home haha
[2:19:52] ElPolloBatman: they've got fred, the chief herbing nodes officer. not to be confused with ellen, the chief mining nodes officer
[2:19:54] Rudric_Ice: and everyone is leaving companys bcuz they dont get to work from home
[2:19:57] Bayne77: these guys just playing with their kids
[2:20:00] ThaOriginalGamester: Bruh, i work a relatively easy work from home job and communication is so shitty
[2:20:04] cabalish: plus everything has to come together all the time
[2:20:04] ghostpwner87: Shadowland is 9.05
[2:20:11] ThaOriginalGamester: i could only imagine
[2:20:26] ghostpwner87: People just need be patient, it is what it is right now

[2:20:30] ShadyWizWolf: Not easy at all.
[2:20:34] Megadisaster24: @vayon They reset Valor before any major patch, so it will be reset and turned into Gold like before most probably
[2:20:43] SolaniumG: dude communication in these times is so annoying
[2:20:48] FiveOnOne: FiveOnOne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 75 months! 
[2:20:50] ColdChillXI: I feel like they will now have the option to work from home for some positions, most jobs now too
[2:20:53] cabalish: some things u cant explain or get over with the internet
[2:20:58] Lantern214: FF14 got us 3 patches during the rona.
[2:21:11] ThaOriginalGamester: i literally found out 30 min before i clocked in at 6am that it's a federal holiday in Ohio LUL
[2:21:17] ThaOriginalGamester: state*
[2:21:18] Bulgogiprince: Japan vs the US so can't compare
[2:21:26] itjustfeelsright: didnt CA just fully open their economy?
[2:21:46] DrSoosh: LOL at Baron Vardus quest in log. I dont want to do it either.
[2:21:46] kilowx: Blizz totally gives me "watch over your shoulder while you work" vibes
[2:21:48] Avinar: japan also didn't do Work from home nearly as much. they had some
[2:21:49] Rudric_Ice: True
[2:21:51] ShadyWizWolf: 💯
[2:22:00] gwar234: it is interesting but once your setup from home is it really all that different  when you are on a computer all day anyways , ive been working from home before the covid
[2:22:08] Lantern214: @kilowx Better have the mirrors at your desk XD
[2:22:09] cabalish: they have to, all the experience only works best in team effort
[2:22:13] ShadyWizWolf: Frigging Baron Vardus KEKW
[2:22:15] Tantrikk: they were together for WoD...hypothesis disproven!
[2:22:19] Rudric_Ice: like the 3d artists and the sound designers the lvl designers
[2:22:23] aeyt: KEKW
[2:22:25] Aquadriel: people talking as in theres been a drought for 7 months, bitch expansion launched 7 months ago, do you start counting since day one? KEKW
[2:22:38] PhillyDilly18: Is Ion the Bill Lumberg of Blizzard? Asking for people to come in on Saturdays and making sure they put the cover on their TPS reports?
[2:22:42] Tantrikk: was joke =)
[2:22:53] Avinar: we are actually only in 8.0 :)
[2:22:53] kilowx: Im still convinced they fired the guy who made lfg and cant recreate it rn
[2:22:54] Grock: @Towelliee Did the wow dev team shrink over the years?
[2:22:57] FAIL0ZOFF: so are shadowlands a joke
[2:22:57] ghostpwner87: I remembering hearing and getting shadowlands back in january
[2:22:57] ShadyWizWolf: Warlords of Dreammore @Towelliee KEKW
[2:22:57] infinitrus: gold inflation expac lol
[2:23:02] Animalfitz: blame new hires for lack of supervision lol
[2:23:04] Clay2K_: @Towelliee i had a meeting. did you get gloves?
[2:23:04] Technogre: warlords of da snore
[2:23:14] Bulgogiprince: The only part I like about WoD is that it makes leveling 1 to 50 easier
[2:23:14] DoubleNova: mobile game adddon
[2:23:38] FAIL0ZOFF: @kilowx  you mean tbc LFG?
[2:23:39] Grock: @Towelliee they had 500 devs in wrath?
[2:23:51] Avinar: and those new orcs we got? yeah those are just some random tribe we found, idk
[2:23:57] Sarole: Time Travel is cool tho
[2:24:00] ThaOriginalGamester: @gwar234 it's about the instant face-to-face communication and collaboration. Having to wait 30 min for someone to see your email to a simple question... but multiply that times 250 employees about 20 times a day. some of those questions that would be answered on the spot won't be until the next business day
[2:24:01] infinitrus: wheres the time variance authoraty
[2:24:04] kilowx: @FAIL0ZOFF yeah, like the fact they didn't have lfg ready just makes me think they let the guys who originally did it go lol
[2:24:06] Wrizzik: we had a 2-yr period where we got to play with Garrisons
[2:24:10] Megadisaster24: Isn't Draenor Canon considering Mag'har are part of the horde now?
[2:24:18] JerBoody: Wod has the 2nd best leveling experience imo, unfortunately the leveling experience is always quickly forgotten
[2:24:18] Bulgogiprince: Loki is entertaining
[2:24:23] kilowx: I like owen wilsons character
[2:24:30] ShadyWizWolf: @Megadisaster24 Yeah
[2:24:34] idenkaz_: TVA monkaS
[2:24:40] ghostpwner87: I’m waiting get some episodes Loki so no spoilers
[2:24:41] Bulgogiprince: I like the banter between loki and mobius
[2:24:47] Exusprime: quickly muted to avoid spoilers
[2:24:47] ghostpwner87: 😆😂
[2:24:51] Boozehound: Next expansion is gonna be timey-wimey to make up for how bad draenor was. Dragon isles, Infinite dragonflight, time travel tech, tinkers.
[2:24:59] ColdChillXI: Kablooey
[2:25:05] Tantrikk: i loved the WoD leveling experience and the dungeons, but after that it dropped off of a cliff.
[2:25:05] bigred_3: WoD PVP was all right for me never really did pve back then
[2:25:12] Avinar: 10.0 is cataclysm 2: electric boogaloo.
[2:25:29] Wrizzik: Blizz will do something stupid and cut a major feature like Tinkers. Calling it.
[2:25:31] heatheraustin: My dogs name is Loki and when they same Loki name on the show he looks at the tv.
[2:25:33] JerBoody: And wod has way better dungeons than wrath
[2:25:39] Wrizzik: Path of the Titans all over again
[2:25:40] Lantern214: Time travel and erase WoD and BFA
[2:25:40] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[2:25:43] gwar234: @gwar234 that is true but there is also instant messenger [teams] and you could always call but i do know what you are saying, like i said been work form home for a few years now
[2:25:49] Grock: true lol
[2:26:05] Lucky8605: That is true for any live game LUL
[2:26:07] Rudric_Ice: they wont tho thats the problem people will keep complaining for the sake of complaining
[2:26:12] ShadyWizWolf: Time travel = Infinite Dragonflight ego stroking.
[2:26:13] jeflag: we need a new pacifier
[2:26:20] ColdChillXI: I stopped playing the expansion way early now im catching up LUL kind of a win
[2:26:24] Avinar: and that's why it's rushed out, asmongold announced he would playing XIV Kappa
[2:26:27] ghostpwner87: 😅😝
[2:26:29] Daggerdi3: Crazy how aotc Denathrius is still only on 24% of accounts
[2:26:43] Bayne77: oooooo shiny
[2:26:47] Rudric_Ice: and then we have asmongold who bashes the game 24hrs
[2:26:49] Maldinger_der_Edellurker: oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhh LUL
[2:26:53] JerBoody: They need to make wod classic and put in all the intended shit they cut
[2:26:56] Avinar: and wod was done LUL
[2:27:09] ShadyWizWolf: 😬
[2:27:14] cowee12356995: LUL
[2:27:16] ghostpwner87: Lol don’t get me started sound like me with warzone
[2:27:16] aeyt: KEKW
[2:27:18] ColdChillXI: LUL
[2:27:20] jeneraljelly: 7 months is way too long :(
[2:27:34] Zenfar_: we had twitter integration in wod by now. hype AF
[2:27:37] NewWorldReign: LUL RIP Draenor
[2:27:38] FAIL0ZOFF: I had a lot of fun in WoD
[2:27:45] kappaday23: LUL
[2:27:50] ShadyWizWolf: Good god. lol
[2:27:51] raymond3195: blizz can't keep pushing ppl
[2:28:00] ColdChillXI: yikes
[2:28:07] Strayer_J: to be fair... its been a rough year @Towelliee
[2:28:11] Rudric_Ice: legion had early patches bcuz they stopped working on woD
[2:28:23] MuttonChopins: BFA patch time seems much better imo
[2:28:24] mrblond5: I liked more wod then shadowlands for now
[2:28:29] Chiraakitteh: I prefer a slightly longer patch life, but not as long as the current one
[2:28:41] Korupcija_: anyone know if there are new augment runes in 9.1
[2:28:45] Avinar: I'm just waiting for 10.0 myself.
[2:28:52] Exusprime: This should hopefully be entertaining
[2:28:58] FAIL0ZOFF: @fnbre  yeah, same
[2:29:05] aikopooh: not ganno lie shadowlands at start was amazing but later down road it killed my interest sadly lolz
[2:29:06] ghostpwner87: And blizzard working Diablo they have teams all over place with games they have going
[2:29:08] papaherc: doesnt matter, wow token is a gurantee for tbc, more money in blizz's pocket, investors happy, nothing changes
[2:29:19] DoubleNova: will expansions keep slowing down from now on?
[2:29:24] FAIL0ZOFF: but at least WoD was fun, shadowlands stink
[2:29:30] easterk: WOD > SHADOWLANDS
[2:29:31] nerdtopia: COPIUM
[2:29:40] majicbeans13: Does anyone ever get an issue with weakauras where you can’t import?
[2:29:52] Avinar: WoD was actually the first xpac I played less than 2 months of. I didn't care for it's theme
[2:29:53] luckfore: id rather have a longer drought at the end then at the begin of expac
[2:29:54] desmo7: did draenor only have 1 patch??
[2:29:58] boootybuttcheeks: Wod was awful, raids were good.
[2:29:59] nerdtopia: honestly BFA was worse than draenor overall
[2:30:02] Aquadriel: but draenor raids were good, good exp COPIUM
[2:30:03] Bulgogiprince: It's funny. I came back to WoW during WoD after stopping in Cata and I don't think I even made it passed Hellfire before quiting
[2:30:05] Metaphix: i enjoyed wod because i had time to raid log and do completionist conent
[2:30:09] Rudric_Ice: True but look at other companies tho releasing triple A titles i guess blizzard just couldn't adjust  with the pandemic stuff
[2:30:11] memnon94: can we talk about the good side of Draenr please ? :( I liked that exp,
[2:30:34] Metaphix: i think hating wod is the default take that people copy and paste
[2:30:41] mwsoldier: Is this heroic?

[2:30:49] D3m0nHunt3r666: towRip
[2:30:57] mrblond5: this dungeon LUL
[2:31:10] kappaday23: Kappa
[2:31:20] MuttonChopins: WoD was enjoyable but there was nothing to do in it
[2:31:29] raymond3195: call in a warr haha
[2:31:29] Avinar: Kapp
[2:31:30] DwarfWarrior25: cheer250 only thing about WOD i loved was the Garrison aspect, wish they implement that in all expanctions =)
[2:31:36] WoW_StandalonE: Shadowlands is the second bad one now
[2:31:43] Avinar: so basically, we will get a .5
[2:31:44] mrblond5: yep
[2:31:48] Bulgogiprince: hahahaha
[2:31:50] Aquadriel: N OMEGALUL
[2:31:51] luckfore: lol
[2:31:54] scridderz: i cant wait to start flying around shadowlands!
[2:31:55] Drogdorf: KEKW
[2:31:55] Jeraiya2: LUL
[2:31:56] Bulgogiprince: I quit because of Garrisons
[2:32:01] NotEnoughMana: ban him just in case Kappa
[2:32:01] DwarfWarrior25: serious dude
[2:32:08] fewyn: the garrison was a good idea in theory... back when they said we could put them "anywhere"
[2:32:09] St3v3nat0r: garrisons is what fucked the game lol
[2:32:14] Bulgogiprince: no one to talk to when everyone just sat in their garrisons
[2:32:14] NewWorldReign: Garrisons was so fuckin depressing
[2:32:15] Volkien: I liked dreanor
[2:32:17] SinicalDev: The developers need to keep iterating on features, not killing them after 1 expansion. Garrisons could've been built on instead of just keeping the table.
[2:32:19] boootybuttcheeks: It followed MOP, one of the best expansions/ and then it was followed by legion. Easy to see why people think WOD is bad by comparison
[2:32:20] MuttonChopins: garrisons was only good for 1 month lol
[2:32:26] memnon94: garrison was fun, but it was a bit too much
[2:32:34] mrblond5: i still play shadowlands but i would put shadowlands even under bfa  on my list for now
[2:32:39] Lantern214: Should have been a guild garrison
[2:32:41] cucksmon: my pp is antisocial
[2:32:41] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: order halls were the better garrisons
[2:32:42] Kineticbomb: The only thing i liked about WoD was that it was a gold making expansion for everyone. So easy to get gold and it was the first time i ever reached more than 2 million gold in WoW.
[2:32:44] Aquadriel: @Towelliee Garrisons were a cool thing, problem was that they were THE ONLY THING.
[2:33:02] belfastcl: were garrisons discontinued or are they still a thing in the game?
[2:33:15] luckfore: i make 1.5-2k gold every day from the covenant missions. I do that on 5 alts so its like 10k a day

[2:33:16] italusx: Sick hat.  ^_^
[2:33:27] papaherc: people despised the garrison because they made like 50 alts to farm the shit to make gold
[2:33:31] Metaphix: i liked pandaria end game too, timless isle is the most fun catch up zone they've ever done, they didnt have to complicate  it to be fun
[2:33:32] mrblond5: garrisons were just a shit idea of  player housing
[2:33:33] NewWorldReign: arent garrisons now the covenant bases in a way?
[2:33:45] kenzellbtw: @Towelliee did you set up this UI yourself?
[2:33:52] ShadyWizWolf: towHAMUP towPog towHAMUP
[2:33:56] Aquadriel: That first room is still a pain in the ass even in TW week
[2:33:57] Avinar: I didn't care for draenor as a map, especially since they completely botched draeneis involvement in the end of it all lol so i felt like it was just a waste of time besides guldan
[2:33:57] mrblond5: ESO have the best player housing
[2:33:58] Bayne77: i liked garrisons in principle but i definitely think they needed some tweaks.
[2:34:17] MuttonChopins: I liked Class Order Halls much more than Garrisons
[2:34:19] Metaphix: garrisons shoulda been a guild thing
[2:34:30] luckfore: i still remember when towelliee deleted all his buildings in the garrison at legion prepatch :D

[2:38:02] Exusprime: WeSmart Or it just wont be sold until the 9.2
[2:38:09] SinicalDev: Islands could've been good eventually too, but Blizzard stopped iterating. It's really frustrating that they kill features quickly
[2:38:24] Lelouchr4: towSellout
[2:38:36] NewWorldReign: whats your plans for the weekend?
[2:38:43] JerBoody: I loved bfa personally don’t get the hate for it
[2:38:56] scridderz: i miss artifact weapons. i still use them in all of my transmogs
[2:39:14] Nokterian: Legion and Bfa my most played expansions
[2:39:14] Aquadriel: 8.2 saved the shit out of BfA
[2:39:21] domnero: the corruption rotation was bad
[2:39:30] mrblond5: yep 8.2 was so good
[2:39:34] Nokterian: Corruption was the mad season and it was good
[2:39:34] Soobaaroo: Sunnyf subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[2:39:36] domnero: 8.2 was fkn awesome
[2:39:49] Haddock_XIII: Miss my 3 x3 td Dk set
[2:39:54] ThaOriginalGamester: 8.3 i became a tank because i had so much left over corruption gear with Vers! I was unkillable lul
[2:39:54] Nokterian: Essences made me play more and get it all
[2:39:55] NewWorldReign: All the stuff leading to Nya'Lotha was awesome.
[2:40:07] cainz22: I came back to wow in 8.3 and blood dk was so much fun
[2:40:21] Nokterian: did the whole 5 masks in horrific visions
[2:40:21] mmrghost7: 8.3 WAS THE SHIIIT
[2:40:23] Tantrikk: 8.2 was great.
[2:40:36] oSpaced: Same here
[2:40:40] ThaOriginalGamester: I tanked LFR and they wiped... i was still up for like 20 seconds LUL
[2:40:41] Avinar: I think people would've liked BFA more if it weren't for the systems
[2:40:41] SinicalDev: I only played the last 6 months of WoD and had a good time. But that's because I didn't experience the drought
[2:40:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: 8.3 was mehhh , besides Twilight and the raids, wasn't as good as 8.2
[2:41:01] MuttonChopins: the mega dungeon for 8.2 was really fun, hope 9.1 mega dungeon is fun as well
[2:41:07] mrblond5: idk why ppl shit so much on wod and bfa i liked both expansions,but when it comes to shadowlands this must be the first expansion i dont like
[2:41:07] Megadisaster24: 8.2 was great, 8.3 was wack, the way it started wit hCorruptions ruined the fun with me
[2:41:08] ghostpwner87: 😅 probably depends came in too play, I don’t think servers were set up as good as now either, if you were noob coming in, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen that episode of south park
[2:41:08] Tantrikk: it might seem better than it was because BfA launch was bad by comparison
[2:41:11] aeyt: i really didnt like nazjatar the zone, some of the wq minigames from there were fun though
[2:41:15] luckfore: class design was bad after they removed all the legion stuff
[2:41:22] luckfore: essences made it a bit more fun
[2:41:25] Exodeo_: What if you skip a SL patch?
[2:41:28] Aquadriel: the alt or offspec unfriendliness made it a big issue.
[2:41:44] akbartheiv: 8.2 -benthyc gear was amazing
[2:41:53] headshotb1lly: subjective but why is it that TBC classic is a far more enjoyable MMO experience than anything retail can give us.... wonder how it makes ion feel
[2:41:54] Nokterian: the alt unfriendly from there was awful in bfa
[2:42:06] Boozehound: What shadowlands patch?!?
[2:42:08] Bayne77: renown ketchup O:
[2:42:08] Boozehound: lol
[2:42:14] memnon94: guys, just a friendly reminder, if you dont have the alpaca mount from the voldun world boss, you can get it this week :)
[2:42:19] Rudric_Ice: 8.3 was fun in pvp with one shot corruptions LUL
[2:42:23] Wrizzik: I had to quit at the end of Legion because Blizz didn't want to fix Enh. And it was that way all through BFA
[2:42:26] JerBoody: I think more people would have liked bfa if more people weren’t mindless sheep parroting a few streamers who got view by making “bfa bad, WoW dead” click bait
[2:42:37] Unciatim: Gee... not like we didnt' see and warn them though
[2:42:43] infinitrus: i am not a fan of grinding the conduits again
[2:42:48] italusx: @Towelliee    You think 9.1 meta healers will still be R-sham, h-pal, Disc??
[2:43:06] Boozehound: Maybe  Blizz should just end Shadowlands at 9.1.5 with a single boss raid of the Jailer in Icecrown and move on.
[2:43:10] MuttonChopins: I quit the beginning of SL but getting back on it just to make some gold for 9.1 raid
[2:43:40] boootybuttcheeks: Covenants are just enough. And with shards coming into SL with eventually 2 legendaries, SL will end up being fine.
[2:43:50] Kinghorn: the void zone on heroic will kill you in like 3 ticks
[2:43:53] Wakkaman87: !tbc

[2:44:13] ghostpwner87: And I think the ps3 version was earlier then that
[2:44:33] Unciatim: Stopped raiding and heaving playing WoW after 2 mths of killing Deni... and not getting one piece of loot off him or from the vault....
[2:44:54] 13lade1: @Towelliee i think shadow res aura good for this bitch
[2:44:56] mrblond5: im going to play 9.1 but idk man this patch wont last  2 months in terms of content

[2:47:03] luckfore: probably cuz it gives you a level and when you skip it the campaign may not give enough exp to hit lvl 60?
[2:47:23] mrblond5: no skipping man u have to put those shards to teleport to shadowlands LUL
[2:47:36] JerBoody: They furloughed the guy that knows how to add the skip intro quest option
[2:47:38] Unciatim: @luckfore Nope.. you do all the main and side quests and you will be 60 before you finish the 3rd area

[3:28:38] mrblond5: i just hope we come back on Azeroth for the next expansion i am sick of going to random planets LUL
[3:28:42] CADZtv: i mean even asmon said that was dumb

[3:30:05] Biorrwolf: Retail getting substantial content at this point feels like a pipe dream. Is that overly dramatic?

[3:30:38] jayeezy13: F em up towel

[3:38:19] indiejeremy: @Kavieonn If you want something more lightweight, Bigwigs is a good choice. You just need to also get the littlewigs addon too
[3:38:26] Kinghorn: I dont think that thing had ears
[3:38:32] Kinghorn: PrideShrug
[3:38:34] Biorrwolf: Surprised 9.1 isn't dropping the same day New World does

[3:40:26] Jarux34: New world looks and plays pretty awful
[3:40:52] Biorrwolf: Still waiting on the next Everquest, man
[3:40:55] manmower: you think New Worlds will have more content than 9.1?
[3:41:14] vic_ave: no
[3:41:35] Kavieonn: wow has been going on for like 20 years, it has to die at some point right? its lasted longer than most games
[3:41:36] DecayedmiNt: @manmower Than 9.1 itself? Yeah. But WoW? Not even close and for good reason
[3:42:07] luckfore: korthia wont last long looking at the ptr
[3:42:08] DecayedmiNt: @Kavieonn Not how MMO's work. Even the original EQ still has players
[3:42:11] mrblond5: i dont care about  anything outside of wow and total war warhammer 3 for this year
[3:42:18] indiejeremy: WoW needs to outlast Madden
[3:42:27] TheUnknowing: new world is great
[3:42:28] saltybcn: No marathon for New World but maybe a 24 h or longer stream?
[3:42:37] Jarux34: Its okay just like you said.. Idk if it will have the full content we will need
[3:42:40] Crowzcut: new worlds give 2 years its gone
[3:42:40] remixonfire91: wow wont die , they will overhaul the entire of the game at some point for sure
[3:42:46] Biorrwolf: It will probably have more than 9.1, but not more than WoW as a whole. That being said, WoW immediately makes anything outside of the current expansion irrelevant, so there's that to consider
[3:42:57] JonnyScotland: @Kavieonn wow is making shit loads of money to this day, it wont die anytime soon. Even if it ends up with less shops people buy the other stuff too, Wow can lose like 90% of its playerbase and still make a profit, it's here for a long time
[3:42:59] Kavieonn: @Synthetiktek  Everyquest isnt one of the big mmos anymore
[3:43:06] JonnyScotland: less subs*
[3:43:11] Unciatim: @Towelliee Gonna play with Sloot?
[3:43:18] Naturalbeef: These new MMOs don't have the lore to keep people engaged. Wow lasts because of our connection to the characters in the story
[3:43:23] Kavieonn: wow still is a huge mmo unlike everyquest
[3:43:51] Biorrwolf: Bring back Asheron's Call!!
[3:44:20] CADZtv: i wonder if riot gnna do a league mmo or completly new one doing a league one would be smart
[3:44:26] JonnyScotland: Sounds like a shitshow to me
[3:44:29] JimtheSFN: I do miss Asheron'S Call 2 @Biorrwolf :(
[3:44:32] garchill: so its just black desert?
[3:44:37] LecterSRK: sounds pretty awful tbh
[3:44:55] Wulfgrym: those games will have power players who will control the games
[3:44:55] TheUnknowing: well technically right now ashes has no content Kappa
[3:44:57] Biorrwolf: Between New World, FFXIV, and Ashes of Creation, what do you have the highest hopes for? @towelliee
[3:45:07] kokochris: @Biorrwolf I was in Asherons call beta.  one of my fav MMO's, such good memories
[3:45:10] Unciatim: so... whgat your saying is... PVP is gonan ruin New World? heheh
[3:45:16] galgarak: create an alliance of guilds
[3:45:24] rsimpson105: If it's a small guild that would only work with an alliance etc
[3:45:26] Biorrwolf: @kokochris do you remember the show Portal?
[3:45:40] MrGattz: @Biorrwolf highest hopes for AoC. realistically ffxiv will last longer with NW coming in second.
[3:45:52] DecayedmiNt: @Kavieonn Correct, but EQ having players means it isn't dead. Really tho, outside of the Asian MMO's, the genre itself is "dead". The others just try and compete with WoW outright and die as soon as the hype dies.
[3:45:58] Kinghorn: 50 lmao
[3:45:59] CanadianCataclysm: Yes New world is only capped at 50
[3:46:05] Zenobuis: 100
[3:46:15] CanadianCataclysm: They raised it to 100?
[3:46:19] MrGattz: if it takes like 400 hours to level fully in AoC no one will stick with it to the end which will kill the game.
[3:46:21] kokochris: @Biorrwolf show portal ? I don't,  I remember camping near arwic, traveling from tou tou (sp?);  Olthio queen (sp?).  I was on frostfell and Darktide
[3:46:33] Wanyequest: I am deffs pulling fort AoC over NW. The "class" system and combat in NW is just so dull to me. Can't play for a fancy looking world alone
[3:46:36] Zenobuis: Its 100 now for guilds
[3:46:40] Biorrwolf: @mrgattz it certainly has the most to offer, but that also means the most to mess up on
[3:46:42] CanadianCataclysm: THey just added DUNGEONS to new world.. Looks really Neat now that dungeons are in
[3:46:52] Wulfgrym: @kokochris asheron's call....my first game
[3:46:53] kokochris: @Biorrwolf but when WoW came out, i didnt go back :(  wish I could have one last time
[3:46:56] BennyHaste: can guilds form alliances?
[3:47:00] tannerite504: @Towelliee do you think big guild monopolies that control everything will hurt the game?
[3:47:12] itscityboy: grind is good
[3:47:15] CanadianCataclysm: Even with only having 100 people to a guild thats still not enough. Most big community's have 500+ or even 2000+
[3:47:19] Biorrwolf: @kokochris it was a show on G4 that based around MMO's that took place a lot in both Asheron's and EQ
[3:47:41] MrGattz: @itscityboy well. grind is good, but if the grind is kill half a million mobs with the same 6 abilities then thats not a good grind.
[3:47:47] kokochris: @Biorrwolf @Wulfgrym good memories man.   I never watched that show, but wish i did :)
[3:47:47] CritcobainTV: you guys need a dps?
[3:47:55] mrblond5: that is what i wonder to what if u are just random dude running around and not be part of any  huge guilds
[3:48:26] Biorrwolf: New World is the stage for the next Fountain War
[3:48:32] rsimpson105: I'd love to DPS. Can I tho? No no
[3:48:34] Wulfgrym: @kokochris show...? i was hardcore into that game my mains were a battlemage and my bow toon
[3:48:35] xauron42: a thriving guild late in the patches sounds ideal no?
[3:48:38] CritcobainTV: @towelliee I'm logging on
[3:48:38] itscityboy: @MrGattz agreed
[3:48:56] CanadianCataclysm: im excited to see new world and what they come up with how there raids are.
[3:48:58] Carl_JM: i hope they add some kind of sunwell to new world Kappa
[3:49:12] kokochris: @Biorrwolf @Wulfgrym I was part of Blood on Darktide, so i apologies for my past transgressions if you were on that server :)  @Wulfgrym, Biorrwolf was mentioning there was G4 tv show that features AC and EQ.  but i never watched it
[3:49:54] idenkaz_: what i hope for aoc is to allow people to rp in the world. like being a dude just exploring visiting cities ect. Steven mentioned that a while ago because he knows people wnat that shit
[3:50:05] Dankeydoodle: Final Fantasy feelsgood
[3:50:05] JonnyScotland: What's scary is if these games fail, we might not see many more big mmos ever again?

[3:50:39] kokochris: @Wulfgrym ah nice.  it was a great MMO, that doesn't get as much credit as Turbine did
[3:50:41] mmrghost7: riot mmo is gonna do it

[3:51:00] Pritamin: o ye riot mmo will stir things up
[3:51:02] Sneekzx: @Towelliee Any advice on a new GM struggling to keep players who are struggling because of progression, in Kara?
[3:51:06] Armdel: who thought that was a good idea in 2021 lol
[3:51:06] mrblond5: we will try it we will see personally me i think we will end up with the same big 3 MMOs again :WoW-ESO-FF
[3:51:08] Kavieonn: Good thing toweliee is not your average mmo player
[3:51:14] itscityboy: I'm cool with that
[3:51:15] kokochris: @Biorrwolf @Wulfgrym you know they were supposed to open source it and release it to the community but they never did :(
[3:51:18] Wulfgrym: @kokochris eq and ac don't get enough credit for how they created the hardcore elements of mmos then
[3:51:18] Pritamin: if it ever gets announced :D
[3:51:20] Biorrwolf: Oh boy, lengthy and fulfilling content??
[3:51:20] CADZtv: riot mmo will do well cause it has what wow and final has a set up lore already
[3:51:21] Nuggetttss: Leveling doesn't equal content.
[3:51:32] MrGattz: it would take someone maybe 3 billion dollars and 10+ years to even come close to the content that wow has. the problem with making an mmo at this point in time is that you are way to far behind and will never catch up no matter how much money you have. people are way to invested at this point in their current mmo to give it up for anything else.
[3:51:35] Dankeydoodle: nty
[3:51:37] kokochris: @Wulfgrym for sure
[3:51:46] Reklusion: F2P or dead xD
[3:51:51] superb0y: superb0y subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[3:51:54] Angerina: As long as leveling is fun I'm fine with that SeemsGood
[3:51:55] CADZtv: lol
[3:51:57] BennyHaste: im not touching it dont matter how good asses is
[3:51:58] idenkaz_: imagine you hit lvl 20 and there is no content because it takes so long KEKW
[3:52:03] TheUnknowing: yeah thats dumb lol
[3:52:08] SixStrikeMatch: Ff was so good in shadowbringers
[3:52:26] kokochris: there is a fine balance you need.
[3:52:38] Biorrwolf: So anyways, we all rolling Paladin?
[3:52:41] oSpaced: I have some cheap friends that won’t try wow cause the subscription
[3:52:51] Angerina: Ashes is all about exploration/wanderlust and social shenanigans
[3:52:58] TheUnknowing: I just feel like ashes is way overhyped
[3:53:06] Kavieonn: i got too many taxes to pay IRL to be messing around with a game where i have to worry about taxes
[3:53:09] kokochris: I see what they are doing, but they maybe giving too much credit to the community thinking they will play nicely within those systems
[3:53:11] Mockle: yeah this stuff is just prone to getting fcuked with by people
[3:53:14] BennyHaste: wow taxes in real life and ill have taxes in game too 3Head
[3:53:17] mrblond5: Major Towelliee
[3:53:18] Epicsapphire1988: @Kavieonn lol
[3:53:22] MrGattz: its a sandbox mmo that requires to much effort on the community to keep it afloat. and lets all be real. humans are shit. if you put them in charge of keeping a community sandbox mmo alive, it will not last.
[3:53:30] enigma7767: i doubt ashes will be anything 18 months after release. they are basically checking the boxes for run of the mill stereotype of mmo
[3:53:48] CADZtv: yes
[3:53:56] JonnyScotland: wow, FF and star wars have lore to help them before they came out, Massive fans of the lore, makes a huge difference imo and helps their games

[3:55:32] galgarak: 1 sub for each limb
[3:55:32] TyndiVelspaz: I heard a streamer say the other day that if people wanted to play a grown up game they shouldn't play WoW.
[3:55:38] DecayedmiNt: Another thing MMO's have to deal with is that the Asian market literally chews and spits them up like nothing. There's always another Asian MMO coming out and they move from game to game.

[3:57:02] Frank4LuLz: so ashes or new worls @Towelliee
[3:57:12] TyndiVelspaz: They were comparing it to games like ESO with a "better" combat system
[3:57:20] mrblond5: i just want to raid ulduar again LUL

[3:59:27] Recaud: aw yeah...
[3:59:40] JonnyScotland: @dirtysocks44 pour really hot boiling water down the toilet, it honestly helps then plunge
[3:59:52] JonnyScotland: try flush the boiling water
[3:59:53] enigma7767: I dislike the people that think X mmo is best and all others have to fail. The fanbases are too defensive, and more options and competition just helps the industry.
[3:59:53] marzetty23: @dirtysocks44  that sounds like a "shitty situation".. get it lol

[4:02:01] CardinalTX: Big true
[4:02:03] enigma7767: You can stop at people need validation. People care too much about what others think.

[4:02:23] Araphas: I used to be like that when I was like 16
[4:02:24] Kavieonn: Star Citizen is the worst MMO right now but i still play it
[4:02:27] mrblond5: i dont need validation from anyone WoW and ESO will always be my favorite mmos

[4:02:33] slimoby: big true
[4:02:39] Alepouditsa: @cheersforbeer but you play a game to wast your time
[4:02:40] Pritamin: I won't play FF even if it is the best, simply because I am not interested in its style
[4:02:53] ThaOriginalGamester: idgaf what people think about the games i play. I still play PUBG from time to time LUL
[4:03:12] BennyHaste: robravenDerp

[4:03:32] Wulfgrym: guild wars 2 is better......in upside down world
[4:03:46] Unciatim: hehe.. Know how you shutdown FF14 chads? Just say... Congratz, it only took you 11 yrs to become #1....  @Towelliee
[4:03:48] memnon94: hell, people are probably still playing lineage 2
[4:03:48] remixonfire91: I playd gw2 for 5 years only cause of wvw
[4:03:51] Masqerader: I played guild wars 2 for 2 weeks cause my friends was like its fun (back in 2012) 2 weeks in they I was done, and they were back playing Star Wars
[4:04:04] Dankeydoodle: I love final fantasy
[4:04:05] mrblond5: ESO is my favorite mmos together with WoW but ppl need to get real  WoW is still the best mmo out there
[4:04:12] MrGattz: they still arint #1 technically
[4:04:14] idenkaz_: step 1. denial Kappa

[4:05:11] MrGattz: if we wanna start bushwhacking weeds ffxiv still doenst have as many paid subs to the game than wow does. it just has a TON of free to play players and wow doesnt have a free to play model
[4:05:16] Krizmo3: SWOTR lost my interest when I had to choose to pay money to get more hot bars for abilities.
[4:05:23] OATHBRVKER: Ay where's the starting soon screen?
[4:05:27] TyndiVelspaz: My only gripe with WoW is how they have seemingly receded from community engagement and have 'failed' to deliver content that matched the hype.
[4:05:40] Sollice: Neverwinter was kind of dun
[4:05:45] mrblond5: Is just the combat man is fluid and responsive not even 1 of the top 3 mmos have responsive combat like wow

[4:06:33] ShadoodHD: i feel like there's supposed to be a "stop it he's already dead" joke somewhere... ah well
[4:06:46] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee hi and hi chat

[4:08:29] we_are_whomp: otherwise its mostly random
[4:08:38] Sevaar87: FF players don't need the validation though. It is fact. Blizzard has to re-release TBC to even compete in the mmo market anymore and that's 15 year old content...

[4:10:01] JonnyScotland: @Towelliee that's because you think about casual people etc and not just yourself
[4:10:03] jjoolo: Shadowlands was very good expansion when they released the problems always start when there is no constant update to the game in my opinion :D
[4:10:06] Dorky1495: @AkeelesWings pally power for the buffs, and Tankadin for the mitigation
[4:10:13] SaulMDGaming: SaulMDGaming subscribed at Tier 1.

[4:10:35] harrekun: Thanks for answers!
[4:10:41] harrekun: Cant find it on curse tho?
[4:10:43] Sevaar87: I think the main problem is blizz fired 200 employees and gives the boss man a bonus. Then shit doesnt release.
[4:10:47] harrekun: Pally power
[4:10:50] thenirv10: which meta gem do most classes use? earthstorm or skyfire
[4:10:54] enigma7767: i loved shadowlands but the total disregard for feedback that has been repeated since early beta is tiring to say the least.
[4:10:54] dwolters_the_zombieman: @MrGattz how are you doing buddy
[4:11:02] JonnyScotland: Soda sounds close to quitting already because nobody will do arena with him because hes feral lol
[4:11:05] Masqerader: need to make an hansen parody of blessing of protection... talking about my mmmbop
[4:11:19] DecayedmiNt: @Sevaar87 None of those fired were part of WoW. It was Heroes of the storm esports people and CS
[4:11:25] ThaOriginalGamester: i loved bfa
[4:11:27] mrblond5: in BFA i played 5 alts now in shadowlands i cant keep up with one

[4:11:51] MrGattz: gotta work on my farmers tan
[4:11:55] remixonfire91: FF Highest pop is from NA
[4:12:16] BennyHaste: yeah but i bet NA uses the shop the most
[4:12:17] remixonfire91: i dont think FF is as popular as wow in china
[4:12:17] DecayedmiNt: @Sevaar87 Considering they had nothing to do with WoW? No one
[4:12:20] idenkaz_: EU has more players than China bro cmon. at least in WoW EU is #1
[4:12:22] slimoby: NA is just loud lmao
[4:12:43] JonnyScotland: and yet blizzard neglects the EU forums
[4:12:44] Sevaar87: @Synthetiktek No, someone had to pick up the missing workers on HotS and esports.
[4:13:06] mrblond5: I mean those sites dont know the numbers to

[4:13:39] dwolters_the_zombieman: @MrGattz if it's too hot don't over do it can't have you having a heat stroke buddy
[4:13:46] Pritamin: they go out to the streets and ask people about playing MMOs Kappa

[4:14:05] Warcried: If the numbers are not publlically available, you have to infer through other ways which is not very reliable ... they aren't psychic. math cannot extrapolate from nothing.

[4:14:55] Recaud: ...ew.
[4:14:58] ThaOriginalGamester: tneNzothEye
[4:15:01] Naturalbeef: Shouldn't he be working on his game?
[4:15:02] Miertez: she sounds like yrel
[4:15:05] grizzlyhorn: i literally will never believe a subjective word that comes out of bells mouth
[4:15:05] Warcried: I've thought i've doing that to play with a friend actually. quitting wow
[4:15:05] Eviltuna13: ESO has a free weekend rooCSip
[4:15:07] TyndiVelspaz: But Bellular speaks for the "common man" player of WoW
[4:15:09] Unciatim: Bel and Asmon can go to FF14 and WeebBrothers
[4:15:11] Warcried: i'm 1900 io too
[4:15:24] Sevaar87: @jjoolo I quit retail and didn't even need FF to do it.
[4:15:27] enigma7767: Remember Bell is a "gAmE DeSignER"
[4:15:29] dracullus: at some point Bellurar will follow Lazy Peon and hellsvsbabyface into shadow realm
[4:15:30] DecayedmiNt: @Sevaar87 ?? being fired is the definition of not having to work at said job. Welcome to the gaming industry, it has one of the highest turnover rates. Hell, a lot of it is contract work
[4:15:32] CardinalTX: FF is a great game but i just couldnt get into all the rpg reading. Had never played a FF game before
[4:15:33] Jacobo204: @jjoolo same lol
[4:15:33] Korupcija_: primal nether and selling boe's is such a good system, idk why we don't have that in retail
[4:15:47] remixonfire91: i dont think bellular will quit WOW for FF but im kinda happy asmon will try FF but with his chat watching that is going to be hard
[4:15:47] slimoby: bel?
[4:15:53] mrblond5: there is no way Asmon quit wow and he said that many times , he just wants wow to be great again
[4:16:19] idenkaz_: i dont like the guy either but he never said that so dont put words in peoples mouth bro. feels weird. nobody is gonna quit this cursed game.
[4:16:21] itscityboy: what will ever make wow great again
[4:16:23] TyndiVelspaz: Blizzard should hire Asmon to "Make Azeroth Great Again!"
[4:16:28] remixonfire91: yup true
[4:16:39] Warcried: WoW had a special feel in TBC & Wrath that will never be relived x.x doesn't matter what the content was. it was just amazing back then to raid
[4:16:46] DecayedmiNt: I can't wait for the Asmon video on the FF store
[4:16:48] enigma7767: lol currently playing FF leveling my botanist, and these evening will do M+ in wow. I like the differences between both, they honestly compliment each other a lot.
[4:17:00] jjoolo: @Sevaar87 I'm refering to people who are doing videos about IM QUITING wow and im gonna play ff cause it's better..cause i stop playing wow during WOD and came back in legion i was never like im gonna play FF now  :D
[4:17:14] BennyHaste: LUL
[4:17:19] dracullus: once I checked Asmon simple armory Jesus Christ this guy had everything, he must play it all the time outside streams
[4:17:23] JonnyScotland: The very start of final fantasy is insanely boring imo, Lots of random walking back and forth and random nonsense, but it's good after you get over that hump
[4:17:24] remixonfire91: he should boost yeah ive been playing FF since HW and i think the leveling from 0 is horrible
[4:17:24] enigma7767: agreed with the boost Towellie, Get past ARR at minimum.
[4:17:28] ShadoodHD: im not gonna fall for THAT bait KEKW
[4:17:34] BennyHaste: Review? im just tryna play the game LUL
[4:17:40] Eviltuna13: Even if he enjoys it he will shit talk it just to save fce
[4:17:41] Warcried: Actually I heard MOP was pretty good too ... but idk
[4:17:41] Broomba: @towelliee rich Campbell played and started ff14 for first time last night  and he enjoyed it
[4:17:43] TheUnknowing: No one should care about asmon's review any ways lol
[4:17:50] ShadesOBlue: whats reading
[4:17:55] EllGe: 100%
[4:17:58] Korupcija_: he's worried too much what his chat thinks
[4:17:58] Sevaar87: @jjoolo Oh i feel ya man, but i jsut didn't need FF or even another game to qui retail. WoW killed it itself for me.
[4:18:02] Armdel: at the very least i don't think he should be streaming the early part of the game on his stream
[4:18:02] Masqerader: let's just be happy he can read
[4:18:04] Jacobo204: that sounds fucking horrible
[4:18:09] TyndiVelspaz: Wait, Asmon has a mind still to lose? I thought he already lost it
[4:18:11] Vita_activa: UR NOT THAT GUY
[4:18:20] FoulBundy: holy shit a 45 minute cut scene?
[4:18:21] Savagedave: hi fatty
[4:18:23] remixonfire91: it doenst make sense for him to do that cause he couldnt care less for the story
[4:18:28] KragnosWoW: I mean when hes re running pandaria dungeons and raids for old xmog i dont call that content
[4:18:29] Eviltuna13: i mean he has to keep asking his chat what he should do on his stream
[4:18:36] Mecabeast: not on stream offstream sure
[4:18:44] itscityboy: farming a sword for 2 years = content LUL
[4:18:47] Sevaar87: Like Asmon taking all the loot and getting carried? "content" lol
[4:18:49] idenkaz_: thank god for 9.1 and some content so people can focus on shitting on the game instead of each other. holy shit.
[4:18:52] dwolters_the_zombieman: you can't relive the first time you play tbc or wotlk again, it won't be the same
[4:18:54] enigma7767: preach trying to figure out what is going on in a ff boss fight is hilarious.
[4:18:59] sprert: asmon maybe even has the attention span for that but his viewers certainly don't have it
[4:19:03] Warcried: @Towelliee Intellect != attention span. We all have different interests. I write raytacers, but I cannot tie my shoes
[4:19:11] JonnyScotland: Everyone thinks they are the main character in life lol
[4:19:12] Armdel: The only way i think he would enjoy the game is if he did the boring grindy stuff off stream or on his second channel
[4:19:14] Warcried: kinda joking about that
[4:19:15] CardinalTX: 100% voice acted I would dig it more
[4:19:15] Warcried: to an extent
[4:19:24] remixonfire91: yeah Asmong raiding Savage with no DBM Or bigwigs ? good luck
[4:19:30] enigma7767: no he did a blind video and tried
[4:19:38] Eviltuna13: @Sevaar87 That on his viewers who join his groups. they know going in they wont get loot. they just do it to be on stream
[4:19:55] Pun1shers_TV: Pun1shers_TV subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:19:56] mrblond5: So wait you blame Asmon for taking all the loot even tho he said  the loot is reserved before the raid  LUL
[4:20:07] Sevaar87: @Eviltuna13 Which I think is ridiculous. but it is what it is.
[4:20:09] chipmonkings: i died laughing when Asmon got his dreadnaught tier 3 shoulders then tried to scam someone out of a 2h weapon offering it up, then had to buy it back for 5,000g
[4:20:15] mrblond5: just dont join the raid LUL
[4:20:47] ButterY0urBread: lol that is what i did
[4:20:51] Broomba: Asmon is consistent in way he thinks and plays. Short attention span
[4:20:55] Warcried: I hate lore too
[4:21:01] Warcried: I love reading philosophy

[4:21:06] militaryrednek: nothing like 30min cut scenes back to back lol
[4:21:09] Nuggetttss: I liked Final Fantasy the movie.
[4:21:09] Thehax: @chipmonkings and then asmon asked his chat for 5kg
[4:21:21] Broomba: @o_illusionz wow dialogue isn’t the same as ff14
[4:21:26] Kinghorn: not in the same galaxy
[4:21:27] remixonfire91: imagine asmon watching the hour and a half of ARR Final cutscene KEKW
[4:21:31] daytonanealy: watching @richcampbell yesterday and it was AIDS watching him juggle chat and story line

[4:21:45] daytonanealy: you need somebody on call discord to help with little querstions
[4:21:48] enigma7767: a big difference in perspectives, Pyromancer was doing FF and enjoying the hell out of it. Final Fantasy quests are light novels vs a news paper comic that is wow quests.
[4:21:50] Warcried: @Towelliee I'm not really disagreeing with you. Just pointing out that we can be good at reading, but hate fiction xD
[4:21:52] satisfye_x: I wish WoW did a better job telling the story
[4:21:55] Taneoyo: I play ff since arr launch in 2013 and I straight up skipped all the cutscenes and dialogs except for the newest expansion
[4:22:01] BennyHaste: final fantasy is all about the cut scenes
[4:22:01] Dasturoswow: Asmon is the kind of gamer to get bored reading text in Mario. Nothing wrong with that but there's absolutely no way he's going to like FF
[4:22:02] mrblond5: Toweliee ESO has the best quest dialogues  i kind of wish WoW had that
[4:22:07] Nuggetttss: LUL
[4:22:11] kokochris: Jaina going danGachi
[4:22:20] Pritamin: JAina does that YEP
[4:22:27] ShadoodHD: i kinda felt sorry for rich cambell when he streamed ff14...
[4:22:30] ShadesOBlue: wow publishes its cutscenes as books
[4:22:32] CardinalTX: questing in ESO is great. I wish open world was more challenging though
[4:22:40] DiscoGobbo: Then you finish those cutscenes, do one quest turn in, and the pop up appears again
[4:22:40] Warcried: I'm gonna suffer, aren't I
[4:22:42] kokochris: @SixFourBoom agree
[4:22:44] KragnosWoW: so what youre telling me is that people pay a monthly subscription for cutscenes?
[4:22:44] garchill: Mooovie time lol
[4:22:46] slimoby: spacebar skip
[4:22:48] Masqerader: like watching a yankees/red sox game from 2004,   like 8 hours
[4:22:51] mrblond5: yea the open world in ESO is to easy when u pass 160
[4:22:53] drmabusee: the story telling in shadowlands is pretty good imo
[4:22:53] Broomba: Ff14 cut scenes and lore so worth it and fun to experience
[4:22:56] Jacobo204: But why???? Just go watch a movie or TV
[4:22:58] Neowanderer: Neowanderer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Keep up the great streams bro
[4:23:02] BennyHaste: warcraft 3 has more cutscenes then the last 2 wow expansions combined LUL
[4:23:13] ButterY0urBread: @KragnosWoW yep lol that is the "best part" of FF14
[4:23:14] drewetling: if i wanted to watch a movie id get netflix
[4:23:19] enigma7767: @Jacobo204 cause people love the story and get involved with it.
[4:23:22] Pritamin: when they were talking a lot in Oribos one time in WoW, I almost left 3 times
[4:23:30] SSD511_: The reason I stop playing is the cutscenes it’s makes me sleepy and my day end really quick
[4:23:32] Warcried: Idk, I'll see what I think
[4:23:38] Broomba: Wed night to Thursday morning
[4:23:40] Jacobo204: @enigma7767 I love a story based RPG too, but jesus fuck I want to play the game eventually
[4:23:49] Korupcija_: isn't that boring for most people
[4:23:51] Nuggetttss: doodies
[4:23:53] idenkaz_: heavensward, greatest mmo exp i had. nothing came ever close to that
[4:24:03] CardinalTX: @kokochris whats keeps me playing it is its so damn easy to get really good gear. Perfect for my boomer casual andy self these days LUL
[4:24:04] Austei: i like ff14 as such a diff change of pace from wow. but cool in own right.
[4:24:09] ButterY0urBread: I love the classes aka Jobs they are fun to play and you can play them all
[4:24:12] mrblond5: Is so stupid the leaders we saved from the maw they just sit their on the stairs in Oribos , Baine is even crying LUL
[4:24:15] enigma7767: @Jacobo204 you would of done hundreds of hours of gameplay to get to that point, and its once. Hell the last Metal Gear game had a 2hr cutscene...
[4:24:15] DiscoGobbo: @magemyway Its ridiculous how good Heavensward is.
[4:24:26] ShadoodHD: that's why there's game cutscenes on youtube... just watch it 4Head
[4:24:29] Nuggetttss: Because it's over... that's when you like it. LUL
[4:24:36] slimoby: ff is a lot like wow if you just spacebar skip everything
[4:24:37] Nuggetttss: JK JK
[4:24:39] idenkaz_: @DiscoGobbo sometimes i go back to the "place" and just listen. its that good
[4:25:02] YardRage: story D:
[4:25:03] Angerina: PSA: you only to do the story once. you only need to watch those cutscenes once.
[4:25:10] Korupcija_: so if I boost I can skip all that story?
[4:25:12] EthicalHermit: you mean like an attunement
[4:25:13] ShadoodHD: well there's also a journal for players to keep track with in the quest log or inn room for recap, lots of reading and replayable cutscenes
[4:25:22] satisfye_x: man even blue mage spells you have to unlock a ton of content to get them all
[4:25:25] tasunke: "Bozja" hey you need to do the raid of the previous expansion to get access LUL
[4:25:25] CardinalTX: buy skips
[4:25:26] remixonfire91: only the story ones the optional ones you dont
[4:25:26] mrblond5: The last thing i enjoyed from questlines in WoW was the DK order hall campaign questline
[4:25:29] restokin: I miss attunements in WoW. The quest chains used to be great (Ony/Kara attunement etc)
[4:25:31] Carbondi: no you still have to do the story
[4:25:34] xxKrayzie: gg never gona play it ^^
[4:25:35] enigma7767: not all, you still have some you need to do
[4:25:36] dracullus: @Towelliee so basically leveling in FF works like filter that make quit impatient people, maybe that's why community is considered better in FF
[4:25:36] Darquesoul: you still have to go unlock the nonlinear stuff
[4:25:40] ShadoodHD: most of it, there's still quests for you to unlock them
[4:25:50] kilowx: but can you get 50min pvp queue times in final fantasy? no? see they dont have everything!
[4:25:50] enigma7767: crystal tower takes 4 hours tops
[4:25:59] mrblond5: The DK order hall questline was sick
[4:26:09] Pritamin: @restokin  do you miss doing them 20 times over for new people too? :D
[4:26:21] Austei: ff14 be like "we got cut scene in our cut scenes for ya bro"
[4:26:26] tasunke: @dracullus nope. Leveling in FF XIV is like playing an actual FF game. And you have an MMO on top of it when max level
[4:26:27] enigma7767: @kilowx you joke, but PVP is easily the weakest part of FF.
[4:26:28] Mecabeast: its like attunements to see more of the game
[4:26:31] remixonfire91: @kilowx  yes you can
[4:26:59] xxplicitt: @towelliee I'm not even sure he'll enjoy the combat simply because it isn't as smooth and responsive as WoW's
[4:27:10] kilowx: @remixonfire91 wait do they actually have 50min queues for pvp iin ff14 or you pulling my chain
[4:27:19] mrblond5: Toweliee do u think they will keep making classics after wotlk ?
[4:27:37] remixonfire91: @kilowx 99% of the peopel just do pvp once a day for level then if you want a frontline pvp queue to pop good luck
[4:27:52] remixonfire91: @kilowx  reset time is when you get the queues fast 3/4h later you get 1h queues
[4:28:01] Darquesoul: there is also a lot of little side stuff to do in ffxiv, to break the monotony
[4:28:08] RastaTeddyGram: AYYYYYYE
[4:28:32] CritcobainTV: towRF
[4:28:35] CritcobainTV: I got u KEKW
[4:29:12] Eludi: even the side quests have fleshed out story

[4:29:15] Goddlin: You never need to do those quests, even for alt jobs.
[4:29:20] Darquesoul: sight seeing log, hunting log, gold saucer and more stuff
[4:29:25] Goddlin: But they're fun lore if you're into that
[4:29:30] Darquesoul: crafting is a whole thing too
[4:29:31] remixonfire91: GNB is the most fun tank rn honestly
[4:29:34] Angerina: Crafting towGold towGold towGold
[4:29:35] ShadoodHD: you just need to focus on the marks with a plus sign and you're set for the expansion lol
[4:29:38] enigma7767: the jokes some of the quests have are great. Some of the side quest dialogue is funny.
[4:29:48] Broomba: Ff14 has a casino too
[4:29:51] enigma7767: Gunbreaker is my tank job. Feels like a DPS
[4:30:36] Yuviley: You didn't? The plus marks quests are unlocking dutys and raids too

[4:30:48] remixonfire91: @enigma7767  i always think GNB should have been a DPS but they had to put a tank in game so they made GNB one
[4:31:00] ShadoodHD: it's a good time to go back to them if you want to :p
[4:31:10] tasunke: naah GNB tank is fabulous
