[0:20:32] JustAnotherCJ: asmon and charlie from OTK? the streamer group? @SlithTheSivak

[0:21:17] JustAnotherCJ: :)

[0:27:38] SlithTheSivak: "You think you hated BfA, but you don't"
[0:27:43] nuclearphosphate: not bad thanks. had to contact microsoft today, ive been getting random refund request emails from anything from 6 months ago to 2 years ago and even some that dont even exist.
[0:27:58] nuclearphosphate: the email address i got them from, after confirming with microsoft IS legit so its not a scam
[0:28:19] fetza108: i like bfa

[0:30:21] MurrayInnit88: Good Thanks dude Hope you are all good!
[0:30:30] Hellbound_Glory: Your channel is great, bud. I'm super picky with streamers, but you check all the boxes.
[0:30:46] BBMezzy: How did they get access to your account?
[0:30:53] nuclearphosphate: huh
[0:30:59] keyboardturner: but why tho
[0:31:01] Implied_Slight: they might not have used their card. could have been a stolen credit card?
[0:31:02] Layliah79: that's so odd they just hacked the account but nothing else. "dumb criminal"!
[0:31:16] SlithTheSivak: refund the tickets
[0:31:17] keyboardturner: are you sure you aren't the hacker of somebody else's account
[0:31:22] havoom01: we glad to have you here@Hellbound_Glory
[0:31:59] BBMezzy: Contact support, change your password
[0:32:15] Layliah79: i became a victim of identity theft late Fall of 2023. Thankfully whomever did it opened all these accounts but never charged anything. I got lucky!
[0:32:16] SlithTheSivak: you can check haveibeenpwned and see if your account is compromised
[0:32:26] nuclearphosphate: i checked the forums on microsoft about my issue and its seems its happening to a LOT of others. so somethings clearly gone wrong on microsofts side
[0:32:29] Hellbound_Glory: Hellbound_Glory gifted a Tier 1 sub to havoom01! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[0:32:35] nuclearphosphate: @SlithTheSivak good idea that @MrGM
[0:32:40] guybrushtw: Maybe they just typed in the wrong email?
[0:32:55] Sunstreakerrr: Might be a stolen card details?
[0:33:00] NMosier85: sounds like someone used your email and someone else CC and is scamming the CC user
[0:33:04] Haestoh: Are they physical tickets or E-Tickets?
[0:33:21] havoom01: @Hellbound_Glory Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:33:23] nuclearphosphate: yeah they do, but not as common

[0:35:10] nuclearphosphate: dragonriding everywhere is SOOOO good
[0:35:21] nuclearphosphate: it might not be as fast as on dragon isles but damn it IS fast
[0:35:30] Layliah79: yep! I must need some of that super duper bad luck protection KEKW
[0:35:33] nuclearphosphate: yeah
[0:35:44] nuclearphosphate: so what level minimum now is dragon riding?
[0:36:15] nuclearphosphate: aww :( i was hoping it was 30 or 40 lol

[0:36:48] nuclearphosphate: that
[0:37:06] nuclearphosphate: refund it anyway to piss them off haha
[0:37:47] Haestoh: don't do anything with it, the night before refund or put them up for resale hahah
[0:37:50] RAF_Sean: I'm just pumped to find out who the company is
[0:37:52] nuclearphosphate: dyu reckon the random refund request emails that dont exist ive been getting from microsoft is a potential data breach?
[0:38:04] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:38:20] RAF_Sean: Did you reach out to them or did they approach you?
[0:38:23] nuclearphosphate: its the fact that they have confirmed the email it came from is legit tho which is weird

[0:38:43] NMosier85: android does it across all google devices
[0:38:49] nuclearphosphate: they do have that, they set up a REALLY f**kin random password and they auto save it on android
[0:38:51] Natsuww: hey what is your overall all the things percentage
[0:38:55] nuclearphosphate: if you choose to do that
[0:38:57] BBMezzy: I use a password manager for that. Can use it on pc and phone
[0:38:58] NMosier85: so when you have an android phone and go on pc you still have your PWs
[0:39:17] nuclearphosphate: ive never used a password manager other than the likes of google password manager
[0:39:25] Natsuww: wow that's alot congrats
[0:39:43] BBMezzy: You do, but it's worth it
[0:39:50] nuclearphosphate: @NMosier85 true
[0:40:05] NMosier85: i mean...google does it for free...with android devices
[0:40:23] nuclearphosphate: just checked GM, you can get icloud keychain on PC
[0:40:54] BBMezzy: You also see content creators get sponsored by password managers, might be worth reaching out to one. Two birds with 1 stone
[0:41:03] nuclearphosphate: dunno about you, the worst dragonriding mount IMO is the stormchaser griffon. i HATE the replacement ability from the surge one
[0:41:54] Haestoh: 60K in one video? or could you have done 60K across 2 videos?
[0:42:53] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[0:43:36] SlithTheSivak: i can just rewatch ur video 60k times
[0:44:17] Haestoh: Splitting viewership across 2 videos is more beneficial for them surely. if the first one gets 40K and second gets 40K they get an extra 20Kfree viewS
[0:44:24] Layliah79: started watching True Detective last night after the convo in here yesterday. starting with S4 cause Jodie Foster. but read each season is separate so can watch in any order.
[0:44:32] nuclearphosphate: i genuinly cannot stand it, its a blatant rip off of SO many games and they are blatantly ripping off pokemon models
[0:44:39] nuclearphosphate: nintendo are already investigating it
[0:44:45] MurrayInnit88: What time do the drops start today?
[0:44:49] nuclearphosphate: yeah
[0:44:50] padmans_uk: Afternoon all :)
[0:44:52] nuclearphosphate: god knows
[0:44:56] Shocklate_: meh I literally dont care, pokemon games have been dogshit at best since Ruby. Nintendo should just make good games
[0:45:07] padmans_uk: I'm good, how are you?
[0:45:09] ImperfectDark: maybe they wanted to wait til it made money so they can cash in
[0:45:16] WochiTV: hello
[0:45:32] JakeSezz: Because people are actually playing the game, so ofc they care now jakese1LUL
[0:45:41] nuclearphosphate: @Shocklate_ honestly the games are still brilliant, pokemon scarlet and violet are brilliant as well arceus was fantastic
[0:45:56] padmans_uk: Nintendo are honestly some of the weird companies
[0:46:03] padmans_uk: weirdest*
[0:46:15] ImperfectDark: to be fair, all console manufacturers seem to have that stubborness. We don't see The Last of Us on Xbox or Halo on PS5
[0:46:18] nuclearphosphate: i cant understand why it even got released given how much its ripping off
[0:46:19] MurrayInnit88: It is fun
[0:46:36] padmans_uk: I've enjoyed what I've played of Palworld although it's definitely confusing
[0:47:05] MurrayInnit88: Apparently its a shit show on Xbox. Plays well on p.c though
[0:47:15] SlithTheSivak: the actual monsters designs are less than derivative
[0:47:31] keyboardturner: so from what i've seen evidence of, some Palworld models are very, very close to some pokemon models, like literally the model file vertices
[0:47:39] nuclearphosphate: i mean, in palworld, you beat up "pals" *cough* pokemon *cough* and use a "palsphere" *cough pokeball *cough* to catch them for a start
[0:47:44] physalis4: I think it comes down to Palworld using the likeness of Pokemon.
[0:47:46] JakeSezz: Or should WoW be put under the light for its Warhammer & Lovecraft blatant influences?
[0:47:53] nuclearphosphate: the designs of the "pals" look IDENTICAL to pokemon from across the games
[0:48:12] JakeSezz: Everything is derivative, really, these days
[0:48:15] keyboardturner: i've personally never been interested in palworld tho just as a disclaimer (and i also haven't really played any pokemon games in general) so i don't really care too much
[0:48:41] padmans_uk: @JakeSezz Yeah, I agreee
[0:48:41] physalis4: I’m not a lawyer, but Nintendo probably has a good case if they wanted to shut it down. It’s Nintendo’s right to protect their brand
[0:48:53] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[0:48:59] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 i hope they do
[0:49:01] ImperfectDark: yeah, i know "everyone copies everyone" is such an easy answer but honestly, they do.
[0:49:05] keyboardturner: I feel like nintendo would have shut it down years ago tho
[0:49:16] JakeSezz: @padmans_uk saltyb27Cheers
[0:49:17] phopheter: this isn't the first monster catching game idk what the fuss is
[0:49:23] keyboardturner: like this isn't the first we've seen previews of the game
[0:50:29] amricatt: I have never played Pokemon.
[0:50:35] havoom01: wasnt suppost to be some drop this week? or starts tomorrow?
[0:50:59] nuclearphosphate: ok yeah THATS also a rip off of it
[0:51:34] padmans_uk: That is quite literally a pokemon reskin tbh
[0:51:43] nuclearphosphate: oh god its multiplayer as well?
[0:52:11] padmans_uk: But what differs a genre of game to an actual rip-off?
[0:52:25] keyboardturner: i just feel like nintendo would have shut it down immediately already and not sit around and wait lol
[0:52:32] Haestoh: If anything I hope it makes Game Freak and Nintendo put more effort into the next Pokémon title. Arceus, Violet/Scarlet were very lackluster
[0:52:53] StreamElements: I've relaunched my Patreon for anyone that is interested in supporting me over there! I've added some brand new exclusive rewards for new & existing Patrons with just 1 Tier at a $1 minimum for all the goodies 🧡 https://www.patreon.com/MrGM
[0:53:17] ImperfectDark: they probably have no legal recourse. The game isn't using the pokemon brand or even the pokemon creature names. They're similar designs but that happens all the time
[0:53:43] nuclearphosphate: @imjoeski arceus and scarlett and violet are fantastic
[0:53:54] padmans_uk: Exactly, it's just providing nintendo with competition than anything else
[0:54:27] Haestoh: @nuclearphosphate I was disappointed with both. I enjoyed Sword/Shield so much and even the Diamond/Pearl remakes.
[0:54:33] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[0:54:48] lyreilla: Morning!! Happy Tuesday
[0:54:53] keyboardturner: more platforms should make official "emulator" software to run on PC frankly, *especially* if it's old outdated games where the hardware for those consoles is breaking down
[0:55:34] physalis4: I haven’t played a Pokémon game in a while. Are they resting on their laurels?
[0:55:50] nuclearphosphate: @keyboardturner ive been emulating consoles since the gba all the way up to the switch on rog
[0:56:04] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:56:16] padmans_uk: @keyboardturner I've wondered why this isn't a thing, I've gone through countless of PS2s trying to find one that works well to play the games I grew up on and emulating is not perfect
[0:56:19] nuclearphosphate: yeah correct, i VERY much prefer having exp share on for ALL the team over individual mons
[0:56:30] yuldovah42: yuldovah42 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:56:36] phopheter: you can turn that off in options in their games usually
[0:56:42] Lugo44: X/y?
[0:56:52] phopheter: by default on though
[0:56:55] nuclearphosphate: @phopheter yeah u can, i never do
[0:57:01] keyboardturner: there's been a fascinating project i've been following called OpenGOAL which takes the Jak & Daxter / Jak 2 games and makes them run natively on PC, not even emulation but literally just reading the GOAL engine source code and interpreting it
[0:57:20] nuclearphosphate: just bought myself a 2TB sabrent rocket SSD upgrade for my PS5, ironically its cheaper than the sabrent rocket 1TB one i currently have
[0:57:36] nuclearphosphate: jak and daxter games SUUUUUCK, Ratchet and clank is much better
[0:58:01] keyboardturner: @nuclearphosphate well that's some weird fanboyism lol i like both games but alright then
[0:58:11] physalis4: Graphics cards are finally going down too
[0:58:23] keyboardturner: KEKW
[0:58:30] nuclearphosphate: @keyboardturner its not "fanboyism" ive played both game series and cant stand Jak and Daxter
[0:58:33] bwoods79: I love those older adverts from the 80s/90s where the computers have like 10MB hard drive and it says "all the storage you will ever need"
[0:58:36] nuclearphosphate: i love spyro and crash games
[0:58:38] padmans_uk: Ohhh, you just asked a major question there LUL
[0:58:44] Haestoh: Probably more cloud storage/cheaper cloud storage so demand for physical is less.
[0:58:49] BBMezzy: How could you choose between crash and spyro? :O
[0:58:52] ImperfectDark: Medal of Honour was SO good
[0:59:02] TruVillainManny: Those Alliance fools always so tribal. Thank goodness we are harmonious friends here on the Horde.
[0:59:14] Haestoh: Spyro, Crash and everyone always forgets about CROC
[0:59:17] nuclearphosphate: @ImperfectDark allied assault imo is the GOAT when it comes to MoA
[0:59:21] Haestoh: or Gex the Gecko
[0:59:28] WochiTV: hey dan
[0:59:33] nuclearphosphate: never played gecks
[0:59:35] physalis4: IGN is reporting that Nintendo went after the person who modded Pokémon into Palworld
[0:59:44] WochiTV: all ok
[1:00:00] keyboardturner: I hope to see more games ported to PC and get remasters though, there's so many old Playstation-only games that run the risk of being lost, especially things the player-created content like the Little Big Planet worlds and Playstation Home stuff
[1:00:02] nuclearphosphate: @physalis4 they need to go after the dev of palworld
[1:00:14] Haestoh: @nuclearphosphate would recommend it, as an adult all the inside jokes are much funnier than as a kid.
[1:00:51] padmans_uk: CDKeys has them available for much cheaper tbh
[1:00:59] nuclearphosphate: what was that sorry? my audio bugged out there
[1:01:21] WochiTV: i use cdkeys often
[1:01:23] WochiTV: legit
[1:01:24] nuclearphosphate: ive only ever bought a single game from CDKeys and i cant even remember what it was
[1:01:34] padmans_uk: It's dependant on how the keys are sourced
[1:01:38] keyboardturner: g2a was using leaked keys iirc
[1:01:44] padmans_uk: G2A went through a whole scandal for it
[1:01:44] SlithTheSivak: likely a lot of credit card theft
[1:02:14] padmans_uk: But haven't seen much backlash for CDKeys but I suppose I'll see the effect when my steam account gets banned lol
[1:02:16] keyboardturner: it really just depends though, maybe they could have got them through some weird refund service who knows
[1:02:35] nuclearphosphate: never done that
[1:02:43] Haestoh: I'm surprised Game Keys even exist anymore.
[1:02:57] nuclearphosphate: where u questing? i dont recognise that zone
[1:03:11] keyboardturner: in the case of Skyrim I kind of wish I could completely separate it, you have to kind of do some minor manual work to make sure it isn't updated so it won't break mods
[1:03:11] padmans_uk: Yeah, I've done that. Steam just feels a lot better than most other available platforms
[1:03:13] nuclearphosphate: ah, i never even went there during BfA lol
[1:03:57] SL33PY: im planning on buying a steam deck in the future so ill try to get everything on there
[1:04:03] yuldovah42: Drustvar has the best music Tigard sound is the best looking one, next to Nazjar
[1:04:21] physalis4: Alliance got the best BFA zones
[1:04:25] nuclearphosphate: i only EVER bought MGS2, cant stand the other ones in that collection
[1:04:28] keyboardturner: just don't eat for a week so you can afford it Okayge
[1:04:40] nuclearphosphate: i love it
[1:04:47] nuclearphosphate: especially playing as raiden
[1:04:54] nuclearphosphate: also my favourite MGS character seconded by snake
[1:05:02] nuclearphosphate: Rising was not fun IMO
[1:05:14] ImperfectDark: I've played MGS1 and 2 to death but never finished 3. I think 3 really has a huge cult following
[1:05:29] nuclearphosphate: i cannot stand 3
[1:05:41] padmans_uk: Can't say I've ever properly played a MGS
[1:05:45] Haestoh: I never really got into the MSG games and universe but I can appreciate it as a great game franchise.
[1:05:45] nuclearphosphate: yeah
[1:06:03] nuclearphosphate: IMO 3 is the worst one in the series
[1:06:05] ImperfectDark: that was genius back in the day
[1:06:52] nuclearphosphate: wait, u could cheese psycho mantis?
[1:07:09] nuclearphosphate: huh
[1:07:54] ImperfectDark: how did we know that at the time? Was it revealed in the game or just a game magazine/word on the street hack?
[1:08:26] JakeSezz: Actual Sniper Wolf, not the steals-content one mrgmO mrgmHehe

[1:09:06] keyboardturner: KEKW
[1:09:11] nuclearphosphate: nope
[1:09:18] padmans_uk: KEKW
[1:09:23] nuclearphosphate: u can just drop a box on her head to defeat her in MGS5
[1:09:24] ImperfectDark: yeah i think diazepam
[1:09:27] keyboardturner: remember all those gaming legends/rumors that surrounded like GTA San Andreas and stuff
[1:09:35] keyboardturner: in the ages before internet

[1:10:22] JakeSezz: Yes you could get demos of other games
[1:10:30] SL33PY: san andreas when u could actually play co op
[1:10:46] physalis4: Speaking of demos. Remember the days of gaming magazines and getting a cd filled with demos?
[1:11:27] keyboardturner: some of the demo disks were fun because i could often break some of the limited maps they ported in
[1:11:53] obbi87: when  do you think we will hear aobut the "Pirat" flag news?
[1:11:57] Haestoh: I remember playing a demo for a tomb raider game where you start in a prison cell and being so scared playing it hahah
[1:12:03] physalis4: I played the Tony Hawk Pro Skater demo soooo much
[1:12:14] nuclearphosphate: @obbi87 pirate flag?

[1:25:30] obbi87: @MrGM You can, you will just get billed in the end of the year, for the total amount
[1:25:33] Haestoh: your friends with a Tory MP?
[1:25:35] physalis4: How do people just decide not to pay taxes

[1:26:00] Layliah79: Boo!
[1:26:46] Haestoh: I wonder why WWE decided to go on Netflix and presumably make less money. than just put it on the Network and get the full subscription amount.

[1:28:03] nuclearphosphate: #Youtube?

[1:45:12] s7wede: lovely throwback to the exploit from ICC
[1:46:21] s7wede: yeah they used saronite bombs on the platform during the Lich King encounter and it bugged the platforms so that they didn't fall off and the Valkyr dropped players onto safe ground. That way you could ignore them and funnel DPS
[1:46:26] havoom01: "hard" achievments
[1:47:06] keyboardturner: everything is so much better with dragonriding

[1:51:51] padmans_uk: I love mgone
[1:51:55] Lausten: Dont worry, its only 2 expansions ago when TWW launches, so maybe they will give us the account wide repin at the end of the Saga.. Kappa
[1:52:25] nuclearphosphate: @Lausten i think its stupid that the Acccount wide rep is STARTING with dragonflight which is just stupid
[1:52:44] Lausten: They made it sound like it would take ages instead of just flagging it all as Exalted and be done with it
[1:52:55] nuclearphosphate: hell, even if its pay to gain rep
[1:53:34] havoom01: did they said they will do some changes in northrend during war within yea?because im working there,trying to get all things done before they change it
[1:54:10] MediumRareOG: I farmed Exalted on all Legion reps on each of my profession alts. It's... not fun. I don't really want to do it on BFA
[1:54:22] Lausten: Yeah dont worry about them doing another Cataclysm fuck up
[1:54:25] hi_im_kage: After faction change i dont have mounts from bfa reputation i mean the equivalent of zandalari or vulperas need to pay 300k 2nd time peepoSad
[1:54:51] TruVillainManny: I hope they put the Seige of the Undercity back into retail.
[1:55:09] MediumRareOG: @hi_im_kage i still haven't bought those 300k mounts. too poor
[1:55:22] nuclearphosphate: @TruVillainManny theres a siege of undercity?
[1:55:23] TruVillainManny: It was the Wrath event that got greatly changed afterwards
[1:55:56] Lausten: I got no clue what you're talking about now, sige of Undercity?
[1:56:00] Lausten: In Wrath?
[1:56:22] s7wede: you could do it as horde as well
[1:56:29] s7wede: the last boss was Varimathras
[1:56:48] Lausten: Was it a thing in retail wrath?
[1:56:55] TruVillainManny: Yeah Putricide took over the city and the Horde and Alliance come in swinging
[1:57:10] hi_im_kage: waiting room for denathrius to comeback
[1:57:20] Haestoh: Dan!? did you see buried in the article about WWE on Netflix. it’s not just Raw it’s Raw, Smackdown, NXT and all PPVS
[1:57:22] TruVillainManny: I am surprised so many don't remember it
[1:57:43] windfrenzy: You doing just collecting on your hunter or you doing account mode?
[1:58:22] Haestoh: Ah cool, I just came back in stream. pretty cool everything is under the Netflix umbrella
[1:58:25] flabo: honestly I think  he might come back in Midnight, as a 'trial' void infused titan
[1:58:34] windfrenzy: i stopped doing dungeons and raids but i dont think it will do quest rewards.  as it didnt with white greys
[1:58:38] Lausten: I've at least gone on the backburner with running dungeons and raids over and over for now
[1:58:39] flabo: since he's a part of the death pantheon
[1:58:42] Layliah79: just found out i got a 4.5% raise. YAY!
[1:58:43] windfrenzy: so im still working on quests

[2:00:29] Layliah79: Aww thanks @amricatt !
[2:01:11] Layliah79: i've seen quite a bit of friends playing D3 again on bnet list.
[2:01:24] s7wede: No real big changes, we get a season "pet". I haven't played this new season for D3 as they are not just reusing old themes
[2:01:38] windfrenzy: mecha world drop mounts are some of the lowest drop rate mounts in the game :(
[2:01:41] physalis4: Kinda wild D3 is still so popular
[2:01:58] hi_im_kage: d3 more popular then d4 Sus
[2:02:17] physalis4: But I guess that’s like people wanting OW1 back
[2:02:22] Jeremy: 100% yes
[2:02:29] SlithTheSivak: D2 is probably more popular than D4
[2:02:36] MediumRareOG: Yeah but D3 was that sequeal that wasn't as good so people played D2
[2:02:37] TruVillainManny: K dumb question: Did we not get new heritage quests in this patch?
[2:02:50] hi_im_kage: @TruVillainManny i think next patch
[2:03:06] Smurflord: ahh yes, HMRC january surprises :/
[2:03:35] TruVillainManny: Okay right. TY for clearing that up for me. I was confused.
[2:03:45] Smurflord: did really well in 2022/23, got a big bonus last year. Then HMRC wanted 80% of it
[2:03:59] handovdoom666: sounds like you live in the USA and have a medical issue. "if I ignore this long enough, it'll go away"
[2:04:06] hi_im_kage: doing loremaster with that flying soo good actually doing grizzly hills that banger music
[2:04:07] Lausten: Procrastination can become expensisve LUL

[2:09:57] TurpisFortuita: what i miss
[2:10:19] Haestoh: Do you think we ever see Arthas again in any way/shape or form in WoW? I know he's technically gone forever since SL but never say never.
[2:10:55] physalis4: Did you go to Costco when you were here last time? That’s an experience
[2:11:06] Lausten: He turned into 25 anima
[2:11:06] Haestoh: You miss out on many Big Tesco trips mate. I'd be tagging along and apologizing on stream after hahah
[2:11:43] TurpisFortuita: should always try and go to a buccees
[2:11:57] physalis4: I didn’t know Costco was over there
[2:12:25] TurpisFortuita: its more than gas, its a lifestyle
[2:12:38] Valendore: I know for us Costco's do not accept Visa
[2:12:45] physalis4: They have great beef jerky
[2:12:49] SlithTheSivak: People are born, live, and die without ever leaving a buckees
[2:12:53] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:13:08] flabo: I miss Tescos. it's been several years since they closed their branch in Poland
[2:13:11] TurpisFortuita: people are made in buccees

[2:13:51] TurpisFortuita: well sounds like you got some content to do
[2:14:13] Xesol: mechagon is such a grind
[2:14:22] MediumRareOG: mechagon sucks to 100%
[2:14:52] ahux_: was a great area when relevant
[2:15:35] TurpisFortuita: so its ok, but like its so rediculous you get lost in the sauce and beaver nuggets and all the fresh cuts of bbq
[2:15:37] MediumRareOG: have you do the mechagon hard mode achievement?
[2:15:44] physalis4: It’s good for people watching. Only place you can buy gas for your car and a whole dining room furniture set LUL
[2:16:16] TurpisFortuita: its like heb but a gas station
[2:16:24] MediumRareOG: you can solo HK8 for the peacekeeper but it sucks to solo
[2:16:44] 324bee21: @MediumRareOG you can bug it out now super easy
[2:17:09] 324bee21: you can run all the way back to the entrance it outranges the one shot
[2:17:19] MediumRareOG: you only get the mount on hard mode. yes you can solo hard mode
[2:17:29] SNAKEBOMBS22: do you have the mecha done meta achieve?
[2:17:44] 324bee21: yup I solo'd it for the challenge mode about a month ago still worked
[2:17:49] MediumRareOG: @324bee21 Yes but it bugs out sometimes. it's super annoying
[2:18:04] SNAKEBOMBS22: dude have been trying to finish that one for a long time
[2:18:07] 324bee21: @MediumRareOG its better than finding a friend i have none LOL
[2:18:22] SNAKEBOMBS22: yea its v troll
[2:18:48] MediumRareOG: my plan to get the peacekeeper is to get it from a future BFA TW raid chest or from a quantum mount
[2:18:57] 324bee21: This week is the week I get lucky for either Mannaroth Tusk or the Xavius Shoulders #copium
[2:19:08] SkelebobTV: Good afternoon @MrGM and chat mrgmHey
[2:19:44] SkelebobTV: I'm good ty, my builder legged it the afternoon because of the rain
[2:19:52] MediumRareOG: The BFA dungeon mounts are all 0.5% drop rate. That's too low for me to farm
[2:20:04] flabo: there are critters in the oil around the boss are when you engage
[2:20:16] flabo: pick them up and go to the water things
[2:21:06] Etaranel: I'm off work with flu, but I'm too weak to hold my mouse. Life is shit
[2:21:07] Haestoh: So I haven't done any Dragonflight leveling since launch. Do they have the option similar to SL where you can skip the questing and level via bonus objectives, dungeons, grinding ect. yet?
[2:21:36] Jeanssi: under the pipe
[2:21:40] Jeanssi: where u came to the area
[2:21:49] LuiBMHunter: not for levelling sadly xp is pitful
[2:21:51] JakeSezz: I actually like em, personally
[2:21:53] MediumRareOG: follower dungeons are awful for levelling
[2:22:01] TruVillainManny: With the xp buff they are not the worse anymore.
[2:22:04] 324bee21: it would be cool if followers could do Heroic dungeon to fill up a crappy vault solo
[2:22:11] NateOliveiras: I found them too slow for leveling D:
[2:22:21] TruVillainManny: Went from 20% reduction per follower to 5%
[2:22:38] LuiBMHunter: better than playing with other people tho :D
[2:22:43] MediumRareOG: Random dungeons give bonus XP. Follower dungeons don't. So random dungeons are 4-5x faster
[2:22:45] keyboardturner: i can't wait to see how many players are gonna get introduced into more difficult solo content
[2:22:47] 324bee21: oh can we cool I didnt know that
[2:22:52] JakeSezz: They did update the XP, but it’s not as high as it feels. I got 40k on a lvl 60, with rested XP, in Ruby Life Pools
[2:22:56] RetroHACK: You get xp from kills but no completion xp so less appealing than random dungeons
[2:23:01] 324bee21: @LuiBMHunter right I only play with other people when forced
[2:23:02] TruVillainManny: Can your pet get you out?
[2:23:04] NateOliveiras: Try turtle
[2:23:06] Implied_Slight: I didn't like them. xp too low for me to bother with for the time spent on bosses. could be a gear issue on my part
[2:23:06] Jeanssi: where's pets when you need them
[2:23:13] MediumRareOG: Timewalking is the best way to level in dungeons by far
[2:23:16] 324bee21: yes
[2:23:42] MediumRareOG: Follower dungeons are strictly for learning a class or completing a quest
[2:23:47] 324bee21: queue for a dungeon or something and port back in
[2:23:49] hairydabstv: yes
[2:23:49] TruVillainManny: the goop needs to die
[2:23:51] MediumRareOG: Or maybe tmog
[2:24:12] LuiBMHunter: disengage? turtle?
[2:24:21] 324bee21: I would insta queu for a follower dungeon and then come back in and start the fight again
[2:24:22] MediumRareOG: A pet could bail you out
[2:24:23] LuiBMHunter: FD?

[2:26:52] Haestoh: you see the rumour that Okada could be suprise Royal Rumble entrant and then go to the NXT Brand?
[2:27:25] MediumRareOG: i'm fairly sure a pet can save you from goop. i think i did that. i'm not 100% sure tho
[2:28:53] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[2:29:09] MediumRareOG: You won't get the mount. This isn't hard mode
[2:29:27] hi_im_kage: theres 2 mounts
[2:29:28] Jeanssi: ofc you can get this
[2:29:36] MediumRareOG: Only hard mode
[2:29:43] hi_im_kage: one is from this boss hm doesnt matter
[2:29:43] hairydabstv: well there’s two drops
[2:29:47] Jeanssi: hard mode is at the end
[2:29:51] BBMezzy: 4th boss is just random drop mount. Don't need hard mode
[2:29:56] Elrathir: This one is a random drop, the last boss is the hard mode required one
[2:30:46] NeeK_23: fyi you cant solo hardmode yet, you cant do the pylon soak
[2:31:06] ahux_: prison smasher is something else
[2:31:38] NeeK_23: the hammers on the side have to hit the mobs
[2:32:02] MediumRareOG: Hmm, I was fairly sure peacekeeper was hard mode only? IF it's not I wasted time doing this on hard mode
[2:32:20] realnzall: @MrGM Nvidia releases a new GPU tomorrow, but apparently a bunch of reviewers only got a partner model that had a defective BIOS and was around 5% slower than it should be. Fortunately the BIOS can be patched, but it's still a shame
[2:32:57] BBMezzy: Hammer breaks after hitting the pummeler
[2:33:07] NeeK_23: hammer has charge time, might even only work once
[2:33:13] 324bee21: do you think they'll add a Dragon Soul skip like they did for Siege?  I still need the mount from Madnress
[2:33:14] MediumRareOG: @NeeK_23 You can solo hard mode for the entire dungeon. You have to cheese 2 of the fights tho
[2:33:48] NeeK_23: @MediumRareOG how do you do the pylons? I do it and it oneshots me
[2:33:53] 324bee21: @NeeK_23 you can run back to the entrance it ignores the mechanic and gives you unlimited time, also the last boss can be bugged or bursted I did the wqhole thing solo
[2:34:09] NeeK_23: oooh nice
[2:34:21] LuiBMHunter: Bear?
[2:34:34] LuiBMHunter: You are a secret furry?
[2:34:40] MediumRareOG: @NeeK_23 On HK8? You run back to the start out of range of annihilation. It bugs out. You run back, hack it then kill it
[2:35:14] MediumRareOG: @MediumRareOG Run too far it can leave combat and reset. Run too slow and it can reset or you won't get out of range in time. It can also bug under the world
[2:35:49] flabo: you can get a title from it
[2:35:59] adampanerabread: is it counting the one from the quest?
[2:36:23] Smurflord: When anyone says "That's weird", I think back to the film Airplane where there's a light in the cockpit labelled "Weird".
[2:36:23] tenbones: gonna be the master of trash
[2:36:35] Astarothe: Jani is a troll in Zul dazar.
[2:36:35] realnzall: @MrGM you give the cloak to Jani the Loa in Zuldazar
[2:36:42] Jeanssi: it's a thieving saurid near Dazar alor
[2:36:54] LuiBMHunter: nodnod
[2:37:05] Smurflord: Airplane II had the shit hitting the fan
[2:37:16] NeeK_23: Airplane is pretty good for jokes per min.
[2:37:20] ahux_: imagine shit actually hitting the fan coronaS
[2:37:50] KaisenSiru: CaitlynS
[2:37:56] adampanerabread: back when this dungeon was m+ in shadowlands during the fated season, i got this cloak from the vault and handed in the quest for the title, but it took my cloak and gave me an item level 80 cloak
[2:38:57] LuiBMHunter: but but we like to point and laugh :(
[2:39:03] NeeK_23: no, Im going to judge you from afar
[2:39:11] MediumRareOG: TIL turtle can avoid the pylon stun. Wish I'd known that earlier
[2:39:20] xeruin: you did it faster than i did
[2:39:40] NeeK_23: I still need the sword from that garden guy
[2:40:21] NeeK_23: its like a warhammer 40k chain sword
[2:41:10] MediumRareOG: better wardrobe causes lots of problems
[2:41:18] adampanerabread: oh no was this hardmode
[2:41:53] MediumRareOG: hard mode can be soloed for the whole dungeon
[2:42:05] ahux_: so whens the new pc arriving CarlSmile
[2:42:26] MediumRareOG: I'm 100% certain about that too. I soloed hard mode for the achievement/mount

[2:50:54] hi_im_kage: tazavesh definietly

[2:51:07] xeruin: reins of the quantum dungeon dropped 4 times for my group this season lol
[2:51:12] thurlingdrome: This one takes the crown for the Robot Wars boss and the music imo
[2:51:18] NeeK_23: its just miserable to do in keys, especially tyannical
[2:51:20] Nativ_TV: I just always felt the pirate dragon is weird and a bit cringe

[2:55:10] NeeK_23: I paid 3m for the Core Hound mount last year from the BMAH even though most people had it free from 10 years ago

[3:00:55] BBMezzy: The 8.2 meta achievement is a longterm project
[3:00:59] NeeK_23: DW the tinker one is a long ass grind, I havent finished it yet
[3:01:38] NeeK_23: you need so many spare parts, like hundreds of thousands
[3:01:40] suzyq1503: the grind is real
[3:01:50] MachoCham: I really want to tell you something
[3:01:53] MachoCham: But I don't want to
[3:01:53] BBMezzy: It's honestly why you want to complete the achievements as much as possible while they're current content
[3:02:02] MachoCham: Because it will crush you
[3:02:06] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:02:35] BBMezzy: Are those achievements once completed not account wide?
[3:02:50] NeeK_23: @BBMezzy yeah I learnt that in Nazjatar and so I try and farm new content like this at the start as much as possible
[3:02:52] Slins2195: hi
[3:03:15] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 Absolutely, I try to get as close to 100% of the zone as possible now after SL before the next patch
[3:04:13] NeeK_23: @MachoCham still couldnt get the 10.1 researcher one done, drives me nuts. Its gonna cost me the meta I know it
[3:04:28] bwoods79: How's the house hunting coming along?
[3:04:36] MachoCham: @NeeK_23 I basically had to farm that hourly
[3:04:44] MachoCham: And hope I got 2/3
[3:04:46] physalis4: This whole zone is a grind. I never bothered
[3:05:22] MachoCham: This was pretty much the blueprint for patch content after it
[3:05:24] NeeK_23: thats the secret fis quest start npc
[3:05:28] NeeK_23: fish*
[3:05:28] physalis4: I feel like newer zones you can get meta achievements naturally just by playing
[3:05:44] MachoCham: Researchers would like a word
[3:06:08] bwoods79: this place was hoppin back in the day though
[3:06:12] TwoAngryFrogs: @MrGM Hey just wanted to drop in and say thanks for the Campfire Toy video clip. Much appreciated!
[3:06:20] MachoCham: The dream is to log in to 10.2.7 and the meta dings
[3:06:26] NeeK_23: there's 2 rares that drop mounts, they dont last very long
[3:07:07] physalis4: I have close to 300 kills on the mech spider for that mount

[3:07:24] hi_im_kage: peepoSad

[3:13:40] MachoCham: Gimme a sec neek and I'll swap
[3:14:01] keyboardturner: spell is gone from my spellbook, so it looks as if i don't even have proof of my purchase

[3:17:38] Vesamora: ???
[3:17:44] BBMezzy: Something something skeleton crew
[3:17:46] NeeK_23: paying £120 per year for the sub is alot for some, another £50 for the expac is probably too much
[3:17:54] steve_mcyeet: I do not miss getting the mechagone meta achievement
[3:17:55] Chesscape: according to data for azeroth 68% own Dragonflight

[3:18:15] Vesamora: what is the name of the toy now?
[3:18:27] MachoCham: At least it's not 30min buff
[3:18:32] freshlux: who would want to play shadowlands instead of dragonflight loll

[3:21:54] LuiBMHunter: always wondered why streamers tend to stream during the day rather in the evening
[3:21:56] NeeK_23: Cham being lazy in Vald

[3:31:07] NeeK_23: tank is now dps
[3:32:17] xeruin: GG freedo52Elphelt
[3:32:54] NeeK_23: just helping plus could trade
[3:33:21] xeruin: so she'll be soloable next expansion?
[3:33:56] MachoCham: BFA should get legacy right?
[3:34:00] NeeK_23: the cheese is that they didnt code evoker lust into her iceblock reaction
[3:34:01] Hyzen88: They did say they are gonna make BFA raids soloable in WW
[3:35:03] BBMezzy: They first said in 10.1.5 or 10.1.7, now it's before the end of DF
[3:35:19] BBMezzy: Yup

[3:38:31] MachoCham: I don't have the heart to tell you
[3:38:40] Anakoret: Ouf i remember this grind LUL
[3:38:40] xeruin: 100% mechagon is going to take a long long time lol
[3:38:42] NeeK_23: one took me farming the same rare for about 3 hours......
[3:38:54] xeruin: too much stuff has an absurdly low spawn or drop rate
[3:38:56] Bware2: remember doing all those achievments..... isch.
[3:39:06] MachoCham: IIRC one is a tiny drop chance off the rig event
[3:39:26] Anakoret: Hardmode rig ?
[3:39:32] NeeK_23: its a daily quest with a rotation of rares, but the dailiy isnt up often and the rare is on a rotation with a low drop chance from that rare
[3:39:46] xeruin: account wide achievements will help so much with achievement collecting
[3:39:49] BisonD: Mechagon 100% was a pain
[3:39:50] MachoCham: @Anakoret Yep
[3:40:12] BisonD: Still dont have the King Mechagon Toy
[3:40:29] BisonD: oh nice
[3:40:38] NeeK_23: thats your streamer luck used up
[3:40:44] SNAKEBOMBS22: how many toys you got?
[3:41:07] Bware2: stupid question -  but achievments are account wide in war within arent they?
[3:41:19] Bware2: ok thanks
[3:41:36] Bware2: heard reputation became account was uncertain about achievments
[3:41:54] Hyzen88: Most achivs ARE account wide at the moment. However achievement PROGRESS isn't
[3:41:56] BBMezzy: Have they confirmed that for old expansion achievements?
[3:42:08] NeeK_23: yep
[3:42:15] Bware2: hehe
[3:42:15] BisonD: haha
[3:42:32] UlthraneDK: Assassinated
[3:42:36] xeruin: i have characters on dead rp servers just to farm mounts lol
[3:42:53] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:43:10] BisonD: you have world boss timers? can see when those two mount bosses are up
[3:43:19] Bware2: oooh... thats a great idea to use boost for... why didnt I think of that.
[3:43:29] xeruin: spare parts aren't that hard to farm, everything drops them and a BfA mission gives them too
[3:43:43] NeeK_23: I do wonder how that will work once cross server realms are in. will the player base spread out more since low pop realms can be used to get names that are taken elsewhere
[3:44:02] NeeK_23: guild*
[3:44:57] Bware2: wow
[3:45:09] NeeK_23: spare parts farm, that takes me back
[3:45:28] NeeK_23: its a hyper spawn
[3:46:37] NeeK_23: 441 BOA gear coming purchased with flightstones!
[3:47:56] Hyzen88: ive just checked outside influences on my priest (old BFA main) and im only missing 5 of them
[3:48:31] NeeK_23: I think King & Prince are the rarest
[3:48:43] dramallama85: what's the addon that tracks the achievements progress?

[3:48:56] dramallama85: that has a popup when you finish an achi step
[3:48:58] NeeK_23: ATT
[3:49:18] dramallama85: mine as well :D
[3:49:30] keyboardturner: I don't have ATT and I get achievement progress but it could be a different addon i have
[3:49:44] NeeK_23: I thought you meant the addon on screen
[3:53:38] NeeK_23: its probably too much for most players, but I really enjoyed Mechagon/Nazjatar. Makes Emerald Dream & Zalek Caverns feel empty and after a few days youre kinda done
[3:54:20] Hyzen88: 8.2? is that Argus?
[3:54:26] Hyzen88: oh no my bad
[3:54:30] windfrenzy: do you think they will make quest rewards for T mog account wide as they didnt for old whites and greys?
[3:54:30] chelfx: when do you start pumping islands

[3:54:44] IAmScarlett__: 7.3 was argus
[3:54:52] BBMezzy: It was a solid patch world contentwise, there was just too much rng involved for the meta achievement
[3:54:53] LuiBMHunter: gasp! you play without us watching!
[3:56:08] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:58:43] x1mmortal_: hey MrGM and chat hope yal having a good day
[3:58:45] ghavian423: Warfonts
[3:58:51] xeruin: invasion achievements were different for horde and alliance
[3:58:53] ghavian423: warfronts even
[3:59:07] x1mmortal_: didnt get anything from my vaults but FINALLY got the worldboss bear form
[3:59:33] x1mmortal_: yeah
[3:59:43] x1mmortal_: its super low chance
[3:59:55] Layliah79: screenshot or it didn't happen
[4:00:07] Layliah79: :D
[4:00:26] MediumRareOG: IME WB loot chance is about 10-15%
[4:01:31] MediumRareOG: I got a ton of manapearls from levelling the Nazjatar henchmen, which sucked btw
[4:02:15] MediumRareOG: 3 straight months of dailies
[4:02:33] skewlbeta: and 13 weekles
[4:02:55] MediumRareOG: @skewlbeta oh yeah for that summoned boss
[4:02:57] NeeK_23: whats worse is that to get both mounts its 3 months twice since the rep isnt mirrored across the factions
[4:03:02] ruffian0305: cant you buy it back?
[4:03:08] ruffian0305: or was it awhile ago
[4:03:19] NeeK_23: item restore is quick
[4:03:55] MediumRareOG: I've been 1 achievement away from the Nazjatar meta for ~2 years but i can't do the stupid mini game
[4:04:13] Layliah79: KEKW
[4:04:24] Layliah79: so true tho
[4:04:26] BBMezzy: You have to be jumping holding 1 foot with your left hand
[4:05:36] xeruin: voldun is awesome
[4:07:28] flabo: soloed mythic 6/8
[4:07:46] MediumRareOG: Mythic Uldir or lower?
[4:08:28] MediumRareOG: I know you can do LFR and you can't clear mythic. Not sure about normal/heroic
[4:08:32] flabo: 2 people on ~460 shouldn't have any problem with clearing uldir
[4:08:46] Layliah79: 441 catchup gear vendor?! when did i miss that being a thing?
[4:08:49] flabo: the only problem with it is mythrax mind control and ghuun
[4:08:53] StreamElements: Check out my Socials! dracJAM  https://twitter.com/MrGMYT https://www.instagram.com/danmrgm https://www.patreon.com/MrGM https://discord.gg/MrGM https://www.youtube.com/c/MrGMYT https://www.tiktok.com/@mrgm_warcraft
[4:09:17] NeeK_23: depends on the spec I think, the balls might be cheesable with movement abilities
[4:09:21] Layliah79: It's nice to fill in slots for tier sets if you're collecting the appearances
[4:09:57] MediumRareOG: the 441 catch up gear requires 1000+ M+ score to buy
[4:10:18] Thoreya: saying he doesnt like it and no one asked for it
[4:10:22] xeruin: it's not fomo like the shop rabbit pet that goes away in a month
[4:10:34] xeruin: or the gold beetle that goes on black market in August
[4:10:37] BBMezzy: Content you can do at any time with no time pressure to get done, i think?
[4:10:48] Thoreya: or maybe im wrong
[4:10:54] xeruin: hoplet might appear on trading post but there's no way to know
[4:11:15] Vesamora: I think he's just saying this is what people asked for, but he didn't really give any opinion either way I think?
[4:11:22] Layliah79: if they only wouldn't of had a flightstone cap all this time Dx
[4:11:24] xeruin: oh if the website said so then i missed it
[4:11:37] Layliah79: i can buy the flightstone gear DE it for mats for Lego! Got it
[4:11:44] Layliah79: YES
[4:11:52] xeruin: blossoming ancient? it's been on the pet store for years
[4:11:58] Layliah79: came out around the same time we got the mount version in-game (i think)

[4:14:24] MediumRareOG: I just noticed Soul Ash got removed from the game
[4:15:00] MediumRareOG: It's just... gone. Soul Cinders is still there
[4:15:17] xeruin: my character has 21,000 soul ash in his currency tab right now lol
[4:15:26] MediumRareOG: ATT is telling me "This has been removed from the game"
[4:15:36] xeruin: and 7,800 soul cinders too
[4:17:19] MediumRareOG: Getting all the recipes for a profession is a whole new level of completionism
[4:18:05] Voujix: A little change ive found that went unreported from this patch, polished pet charms now stack more than 1000, currently have 2611 stacked now instead of all in my bank, nice quality of life as a collector
[4:18:18] ghavian423: I Almost have all Cooking and Alchemy recipes
[4:18:23] Layliah79: Ooo that's awesome.
[4:18:30] CpnRad: good evening
[4:18:41] Layliah79: yes! got rid of the ones from Legion.
[4:19:05] CpnRad: i have decided tmog collection is my thing and i've ran about 15 raids in 2 days
[4:19:14] MediumRareOG: Rep tokens still stack in 5s. Can they fix that?
[4:19:47] ghavian423: I wish!
[4:20:08] MediumRareOG: I have 1.5 banks filled with rep tokens

[4:21:27] CpnRad: Get Hek'd is pretty rough
[4:21:33] S3N71: Good late afternoon MrGM and stream chat
[4:21:42] xaxxas_: BfA got too much hate
[4:21:54] Midgens_: BFA was great
[4:21:55] alextheblight: azerite armor
[4:21:58] xaxxas_: It was like an attempt to soft reboot the Warcraft IP
[4:22:01] Thoreya: bfa <#
[4:22:02] Atomicpanda: BfA is great outside of the armor
[4:22:02] Thoreya: <3
[4:22:02] Midgens_: ...if you didn't care much about raiding
[4:22:11] CpnRad: im a BFA apologist, it was great, just a rough first patch. but thats not relevant any more
[4:22:23] Necoc: it was mostly the story for me, with some exceptions
[4:22:30] ghavian423: Youre not having to do the Azerite stuff
[4:22:35] xeruin: the azerite grind was awful and i hated the BfA story but it was full of stuff to collect
[4:22:48] Thoreya: u didnt like the corruption patch?
[4:23:00] MediumRareOG: BFA was horribly for playing off spec and alts, probably the worst expansion
[4:23:08] alextheblight: my biggest gripe was azerite armor, Sylvanas getting hit with the villain bat, and a faction war narrative rehashed from MoP nobody asked for
[4:23:14] CpnRad: not a day goes by I dont think about my 2H wep with Twilight Devastation
[4:23:18] Atomicpanda: the pinkamid was awful, but the alliance harbor was great
[4:23:24] StreamElements: Reclaiming GILNEAS in 10.2.5! Complete Story Playthrough & Rewards - https://youtu.be/C-QpageNFY0
[4:23:36] S3N71: I loved the expansion start to finish.  *And* levelled a Horde alt to max level for the achievement
[4:23:36] alextheblight: gripes, rather
[4:23:55] xeruin: faction war narrative was garbage
[4:24:12] alextheblight: I liked assaults and horrific visions, though
[4:24:15] Bu_Remie: the problem with BFA is it lead to shadowlands.
[4:24:20] alextheblight: and essences were fun
[4:24:20] MediumRareOG: No skip for the 8.3 cloak, horrible catch up for HoA essences, locking in Azerite traits, forcing PvP for PvE essences. Let's not forget the awful
[4:24:21] Atomicpanda: i'd put BfA in my top four, maybe three.
[4:24:40] alextheblight: "hold my beer" as they say
[4:24:45] jshukster: bfa had too much old god flavor could have focused just on factions
[4:24:51] xeruin: i didn't do shadowlands when it was current, but just collecting stuff in shadowlands 1 expac later is fun
[4:24:52] Layliah79: SL was a great expansion for collections
[4:24:52] Valshaw: I actually liked SL D:
[4:24:53] Harai_Ulfsark: i thought the build up from the house stormsong plot, the crucible raid and then nzoth being released was good
[4:24:53] Radiopools: Shadowlands really redeemed BfA lmao
[4:25:07] xaxxas_: Which is crazy because realistically Burning Teldrassil would have reignited 20 more years of ingame war/hatred but they tried to wrap it up
[4:25:12] CpnRad: Azshara could have been an expac on her own
[4:25:21] Valshaw: SL > BfA IMO :P
[4:25:29] Thoreya: i really liked essences corruption the zones, always something to do..loved the raids too
[4:25:42] skewlbeta: always liked BFA....looking forward to people coming out saying how wonderful covenants were and how torghast was fun
[4:25:47] alextheblight: should have focused more on the drust and later N'zoth and it would have been great
[4:25:53] Atomicpanda: vulpera really redeem the whole thing. you all know it.
[4:25:56] CeasiusPls: doubt you'd get major hate, everyone upset about bfa have probably forgotten it
[4:26:02] Valshaw: I did have fun in Torghast >>;
[4:26:05] databob1: BFA good?  I'm out
[4:26:16] xeruin: torghast is fun now that i can overpower it, idk if anyone found it fun back in SL
[4:26:18] lynscribe: I actually really enjoyed Shadowlands and the end of BfA
[4:26:25] SNAKEBOMBS22: unpop opinion shadowlands was good
[4:26:29] MediumRareOG: Per=covenant anima, anima in your bags. Let's not forget the awful
[4:26:33] Bware2: visions?
[4:26:36] skewlbeta: yes
[4:26:38] databob1: I'm kidding anyway
[4:26:39] Layliah79: Corruption Dx
[4:26:42] alextheblight: ny'alotha and assaults and horrific visions
[4:26:47] skewlbeta: we had like a whole year or something of nothing new
[4:26:48] alextheblight: I liked them
[4:26:51] Valshaw: BfA was just Nyalotha and Visions from January to November
[4:26:52] MediumRareOG: Just killed NZoth and screwed around with corruptions?
[4:26:53] xeruin: SL would have been terrible when you couldn't mount in the maw
[4:26:55] mattzomix: we killed nzoth and watched anduin being captured by silvanas
[4:26:55] Tequima: Famed for gold for the 5m gold mount XD
[4:26:58] Layliah79: Corruption gear was the WORST until the vendor
[4:27:05] MrEvilRex: honestly everything after Legion was "meh" at nest
[4:27:08] MrEvilRex: best*
[4:27:21] Harai_Ulfsark: i dont miss spending 6 hours in twisting corridors
[4:27:29] skewlbeta: that was literally the maw music - dun dun dunnnn
[4:27:32] mattzomix: and we were able to kill ICC Bosses in Icecrown
[4:27:35] databob1: BFA 8:3vi
[4:27:45] catstar88: mrgmLuna
[4:27:58] alextheblight: shadowlands prepatch cinematic?
[4:28:00] Layliah79: search anduin abduction LOL
[4:28:05] alextheblight: there it is
[4:28:31] databob1: BFA 10.3: Visions & Shit

[4:28:55] skewlbeta: remember when we thought bolvar would do anything
[4:28:57] Layliah79: where did we leave Bolvar? In SL?
[4:28:58] Vesamora: I played this content and don't remember this at all
[4:29:01] alextheblight: not much of SL's Khadgar
[4:29:02] CpnRad: Bolvar has been LK longer than Arthas ever was, where does time go
[4:29:05] zanriah: bolvar was such a chad during legion
[4:29:08] Vesamora: I just kind of blotted Shadowlands from my memory
[4:29:09] alextheblight: Taelia PrideLesbian
[4:29:11] Harai_Ulfsark: for what purpose tho, its a mystery
[4:29:11] redcrimtane: remember that time DKs got to eat extremely well for like 1 and a half patches
[4:29:15] skewlbeta: that Nathanos cinematic though was *exsquisite*
[4:29:27] xeruin: Bolvar totally did something he was our SL tour guide
[4:29:28] ShineyFighter: money :/
[4:29:41] databob1: Remember that time where Bulvar didn't do squat
[4:29:48] alextheblight: rude
[4:29:50] Layliah79: turn it up a bit
[4:29:53] alextheblight: interrupting the cinematic
[4:30:18] alextheblight: the mob interrupted, that is
[4:30:32] ShineyFighter: Yoink!
