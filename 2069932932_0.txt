[5:40:40] gbgrozev: then you only have the tank to worrie about
[5:40:56] daLuhz: ive killed this fight in 11 mins and 5mins so its probably not a dps angle
[5:41:07] DjStingray: nice, only did a lil bit of mage healing, it feels cool
[5:41:08] mindgame: nobody wants to listen
[5:41:11] catnograss: birdJAM
[5:41:35] itbeHootie: HE is NOT a healer. Can't YOU SEE he's in SHADOW FORM? KEKW
[5:41:38] gbgrozev: highest prio is closing the vents
[5:41:43] djvizdom: decoy tank to eat a hit during phase transition
[5:41:46] gbgrozev: if a mele is close then it should go

[5:44:13] Murderfaace: only 2 guys above 200 dps OOF
[5:44:25] mindgame: your tank is dumb
[5:44:25] BasicSnake: rogue got aggro too early
[5:44:34] DjStingray: now that woulda been a good brez
[5:44:39] BasicSnake: warr is running too far awaay from boss
[5:44:40] gbgrozev: Give the tank spirit of the alpha
[5:44:40] mindgame: its 100% possible to just kite the fire stacks
[5:44:42] 3lyd0n: how is this raid so easy ? i didnt play sod yet but i see u go to the "final raid" freshly 40 without even learning your new skills.... and u do 6/6 ez pz
[5:44:43] djvizdom: running too far away
[5:44:43] gbgrozev: problem solved
[5:45:04] HappyThing: u have a bres?

[5:46:14] elpillard: even pet can tank it while someone remove stacks on tank
[5:46:22] gbgrozev: Its the ST fist that gives stacks
[5:46:24] BasicSnake: It doesn't, but he is standing in the breath
[5:46:29] djvizdom: pet taunt really good here
[5:46:40] gbgrozev: No
[5:46:47] djvizdom: AFTER hes done flaming
[5:46:55] AgentIce99: no getting hit with melees gives stacks
[5:46:57] Seabrookx: No not only
[5:47:04] gbgrozev: Sprocket Fire punch gives tank stacks
[5:47:05] mindgame: tank kites the flame, dps chills a bit during it
[5:47:07] Seabrookx: Getting hit too
[5:47:31] Stars69: make sure he tanks in front of room too and not too inside the arena
[5:47:32] djvizdom: and dont be too far away while kiting or else you drop threat and he spins
[5:47:32] BasicSnake: The sprocket fire doesn't go on randoms
[5:47:41] elpillard: u got this
[5:47:42] BasicSnake: so he isn't getting that unless he is tanking
[5:47:50] TX_Mandalorian: Kinda strange seeing you not playing a mage ziqoPEPEZ
[5:47:55] gbgrozev: @Ziqoftw The Sprocket Fire punch also gives stacks
[5:49:01] gbgrozev: make them taunt at 3 stacks and please give that rogue spirit of the alpha so he keeps threat
[5:49:42] gbgrozev: if you taunt AFTER every furnace surge you will be fine and no dps should get stacks
[5:49:49] Blazerrow11: Aspect
[5:49:58] mindgame: hes kiting perfefctly
[5:50:03] Twiz121: thats a good kite
[5:50:04] Stars69: i told him to do that
[5:50:10] Stars69: the first time i think he misinterpreted
[5:50:14] Stars69: this time was more clean
[5:50:30] BasicSnake: Warr is too far away from the boss there
[5:50:42] BasicSnake: He might drop aggro
[5:50:45] djvizdom: decoy tank here
[5:50:53] Murderfaace: Rogue tank is REALLY hard to heal on this guy
[5:50:54] Taurenu: Should you tank boss closer to bomb buttons?
[5:50:58] Murderfaace: Can't be too hard on heals
[5:51:02] TX_Mandalorian: i feel bad for the healers
[5:51:15] DjStingray: I would come out of shadow for that
[5:51:18] DjStingray: but that is me
