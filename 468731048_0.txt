[1:13:03] LeaningRod: @gibbsie jumping out of reach so all the mobs teleport to you
[1:13:10] DerPolitologe: "Dont leave guys - need this key for weekly" - Black Mamba / Hypers
[1:13:13] barathren: Omg how they died like that
[1:13:13] fancyfwoggy: gg hypers win
[1:13:16] mehdster2: snapping is where you pull a large pull and step onto a ledge or area that teleports all the adds to your location
[1:13:20] Tamraine: @neurodr0me each key level (this is +17) increases difficulty, but you get better rewards. So you finish your +9, you can try your +10 (or +11 or +12 if you went super fast)
[1:13:20] Aknul: @scramss hi fren
[1:13:28] eggman_br: Sanpping is pulling mobs to a place they can´t wal to, so they teleport (nap) to your position
[1:13:35] Eatmyr4ge: i ve done 20s keys way better with just pugs

[3:26:02] PieceOfPanic: I don't blame the players for choosing what gives them the edge of the competition, but it's just not great entertainment to see the same comp over and over again. Must be rough to both play and cast as well.

[3:28:05] TerranceTV: @AutomaticJak Respect on that

[3:29:34] PieceOfPanic: no the start of the stream was great, comps came out with different classes. it was much better entertainment.
[3:29:36] Karper69: class stacking shouldn't be allowed imo
[3:29:41] Sleepypan: @lilyevlolinalilith yeah in Legion we had failure dection pylons so we didnt need 300 rogues to shroud

[4:45:17] masterpastulio: please remember to be easy on Blizzard, they are an indie company, they are still learning how to develop good games. Lets not be too harse on them with their bugs
[4:45:17] Lennoxas: @NightRaven_118168 AAA was already going to last boss when shark bugged out. BM was still half way through third
[4:45:21] ConcernedGaming: @Selaen The shark didn't do any damage tho. But it was probably worth a reset regardless since I saw the Druid trying to kite it even when it wasn't doing damage, which makes it harder to heal

[5:05:56] Sleepypan: @Phooshie i completely disagree that it was boring.I think its more boring now but maybe thats just because i dislike the dungeons more and its not really the same people/community i mean some are same but like i ran arcway and lower 100+ times one season i couldnt see myself running 100+ of any of these dungeons in a season
