[5:05:31] typer___iban: SP coefficient 100 -> 42.9%
[5:05:33] monkatos_andy: PogO
[5:05:39] Jack_kgbeast: The base damage of Starsurge has been reduced by 30%. Additionally, we’ve identified and fixed a bug in the Starsurge spellpower coefficient and this has now been corrected. Starsurge should be properly gaining 42.9% of spellpower as damage now, as intended. To compensate for this adjustment, we will be adding an additional effect to Starsurge that causes your next Starfire to cause 66% additional damage.

[11:39:31] azumai_xyz: why is it so laggy

[11:54:52] journeygaming3: Has no1 managed to fix a maelstrom rune weakaura? I cant find anything for SoD unfortunately
[12:02:06] cosmicoriginz: i don't think u can boost
[12:02:25] drezski: boosting is dealing with other people
[12:02:31] cosmicoriginz: SoM anti-boosting measures
[12:02:56] cosmicoriginz: The anti-boosting stuff wasn't in lower level
[12:03:21] cosmicoriginz: Try it and find out i guess
[12:03:34] LoofyDizzle: x to doubt
[12:03:44] cosmicoriginz: Cath boost was hard on 60 mage no shot 40 mages can do it
[12:04:10] cosmicoriginz: It only worked cause 60 mages resisted spells
[12:04:44] cosmicoriginz: They nerfed self healing
[12:04:48] drezski: the arcane slow is pretty shit aswell in cath
[12:05:09] drezski: which you can trinket
[12:05:13] drezski: can always do a FAP pull
[12:05:14] journeygaming3: People will figure it out, they always do
[12:05:34] cosmicoriginz: nothing it's nerfed
[12:05:39] cosmicoriginz: correct
[12:05:47] cosmicoriginz: arcane blast is nerfed
[12:05:56] badraztas: theres a new healing rune that does like 500's
[12:05:56] cosmicoriginz: can't heal yourself
[12:05:57] journeygaming3: You heal through casts now right?
[12:06:03] journeygaming3: Not through damage? Unless im mistaken
[12:06:15] cooosx: chronostatic preservation heals for 1100 on a 2 sec cast at 350 mana
[12:06:18] Ricweedx: Instead of nerfing SWD, I would nerf VE instead tbh no?
[12:06:26] Ricweedx: I feel like it heals like a ton LUL
[12:07:46] cosmicoriginz: they would be selling it already if they could
[12:08:03] cosmicoriginz: not in cath
[12:08:22] sudzybean: he can be on the shelf above or on the other side of the cave too

[12:20:43] Space_Lotus: yes
[12:20:46] qbatrGG: 100% know what ure saying
[12:20:46] basedguy123_: toxic
[12:20:56] KhalaVenix: why so agitaed bratski
[12:21:14] cooosx: keyvan was the first WC booster, no?
[12:21:47] toonits: the non aoe heal
[12:22:07] Vxetz: 5 min ad see u guys at p3
[12:22:28] journeygaming3: So, was he as trash as you thought from the way he spoke or
[12:22:36] journeygaming3: Such a odd take lol
[12:22:57] journeygaming3: He is the one figuring out all ther boosting routes in p1 and p2, and you call him bad
[12:22:58] dj_efx: hes collecting them so its a tighter pile
[12:23:10] fukano10: backseatgaming right there
[12:23:36] dj_efx: i wouldnt call him a noob. most players wouldnt be able to do what hes doing
[12:23:51] journeygaming3: Why wouldn't he lol
[12:23:52] eXTreMe1337: that guy was one of the first WC solo boosters
[12:24:04] dj_efx: wait was that ahmpy or keyvan?
[12:24:10] eXTreMe1337: with complete dungeon in 1 oull
[12:24:18] eXTreMe1337: keyvan
[12:24:33] dj_efx: bruh thats keyvan, yea ahmpy might be better, keyvan still in the top tho bruh lol
[12:24:45] journeygaming3: Your takes are bad, ngl
[12:24:50] Iratic: no ones denying that
[12:24:50] dj_efx: hating for no reason
[12:25:15] journeygaming3: Just because ahmpy is good doesn't make him bad lol
[12:25:34] Hanzoo0: i mean its the same boost as it is at lvl 60 just dont look very efficient to me as he is doing it with a lot of small pulls if amount of pulls will be reduced then yeah would be dope imo
[12:25:39] dj_efx: everything could be done better. but no one could do what keyvan was doing in wc for months
[12:26:01] journeygaming3: But no1 did what he did better, so I dont understand it
[12:26:14] journeygaming3: He created the WC route
[12:26:18] journeygaming3: And all used it
[12:26:29] journeygaming3: The guy you looked at was the first wc booster i p1
[12:26:34] journeygaming3: and everyone copied him
[12:27:05] journeygaming3: What makes you good then, getting 99 parses in classic?
[12:27:18] dj_efx: youre just giving generally hater remarks. hes not a rank 1 mage, but hes better than the majority of the player base
[12:27:50] dj_efx: hes showing the route week 1 of phase 2. i dont think hes trying to min max it with no gear lol
[12:27:56] journeygaming3: There is a difference between being good and being the best dude
[12:28:03] journeygaming3: Just because ahmpy is better, doesnt mean he is bad
[12:28:06] dj_efx: youre just being a hater
[12:28:20] sykey7: smart but not able to press buttons correctly
[12:28:22] qbatrGG: just cuz ur the first to do something doesnt mean ur good at it, ur just interested in being the first
[12:28:24] journeygaming3: By the logic you are using no1 except retail mythic world first raiders are good
[12:28:29] journeygaming3: Because no1 else can compete like they do

[12:29:46] Iratic: DinoDance
[12:29:52] drezski: lmao oof

[12:30:44] hadouken300: what if he is a 75 months sub on one of the channels
[12:31:34] goldacte: Ban him at pokimane's channel
[12:31:55] journeygaming3: Now that chat is live ill ask any shamans here, anyone figure out maelstrom weakaura yet?
[12:32:15] sykey7: @goldacte that would make him a favor
[12:32:59] Erik24: yea but every channel is abit much cuase u got hurt
[12:33:22] tingerset: а как сейчас подписку покупают? хочу в sod поиграть, не понимаю, только через фанпей?
[12:33:53] Sowiloo: example of a good mechanical player?
[12:34:59] journeygaming3: Isnt there a difference doing practice and having it on "farm" though
[12:35:10] journeygaming3: When you do the pull for the first 10 times and the 1000th time is gonna look different
[12:35:40] journeygaming3: Like improving the mara pull, did you improve it the first pull you did, or did it take practice?
[12:36:19] journeygaming3: The route in cath in this case
[12:37:14] journeygaming3: Ah well, doesnt matter I guess, we just have different ideas of what makes someone good
[12:37:17] toonits: this reminds me of how some people killed themselves on HC PepeLaugh
[12:37:44] Scoobythegawddd: this looks painful to level my friend
[12:38:22] journeygaming3: I just assumed he didnt pull mroe because he would risk getting dazed and dying losing all consumes
[12:38:29] journeygaming3: Otherwise it would make no sense
[12:38:35] Scoobythegawddd: haha i would be getting a brain tumour killing these mobs
[12:39:04] Wiggen_: who we talking about?
[12:39:06] journeygaming3: I hear you, I guess I just didnt see what globals you were talking about
[12:39:08] qbatrGG: People who cant see/feel that his bad, is prob bad
[12:39:16] journeygaming3: He was juggling the mobs on the edge
[12:39:22] journeygaming3: And missed a few globals while juggling
[12:39:25] journeygaming3: But I dont think you noticed that
[12:40:44] qbatrGG: KEKW
[12:40:47] journeygaming3: Fair enough
[12:40:50] ZwoopINC: LUL
[12:41:07] asapblocktv: ICANT
[12:41:17] qbatrGG: @asapblocktv KEKL
[12:41:18] journeygaming3: No thats not honest
[12:41:24] journeygaming3: I said there was a difference between being good and the best
[12:41:55] journeygaming3: Just because mirlol is the best, doesnt mean other rogues cant be good was my point
[12:41:58] journeygaming3: But yea it doesnt matter
[12:42:07] iNSANEono: forsenY
[12:42:23] Phahman: Holy shit this guy ICANT
[12:43:11] journeygaming3: I hear you
[12:44:05] asapblocktv: even maraudon 500+ mobs is eassy
[12:44:06] journeygaming3: Its always easy to copy
[12:44:29] journeygaming3: Which is why I have more respect to people innovating than the people just copying it and being good
[12:45:27] Erik24: zeroji?
[12:45:39] Sowiloo: zeroji is a legend
[12:46:47] journeygaming3: I mean, that sounds like such a load imma be honest lol
[12:47:00] journeygaming3: "I would be the greatest but I dont have time"
[12:47:05] asapblocktv: you gonna stream BB pvp event ?
[12:47:17] Erik24: i mean if you could do it u would
[12:47:53] Sowiloo: are you satisfied about the druid nerf
[12:47:54] asapblocktv: not booty beef  bar
[12:48:11] iNSANEono: remember when mn invented the solo holy water farm ULLE biggest waste of time in world
[12:48:44] journeygaming3: What is your current goal in SoD then? Just having the best parses?
[12:49:14] wiild1: because good players are fat pussies
[12:49:18] journeygaming3: Didnt ahmpy gain success in hardcore?
[12:49:25] Erik24: yea cuase HC is slow, good for the people that cant do things fast
[12:49:39] Releaserage: who would even play hc ssf LUL
[12:50:04] journeygaming3: He was a great player that played hardcore is what I ment
[12:50:08] journeygaming3: or he is a great player
[12:50:10] Traihart: Classic HC player : 1-9 keybinds Kappa
[12:51:51] journeygaming3: I will agree with you, that a lot of bad players are playing hardcore though
[12:52:14] journeygaming3: Its just
[12:52:21] drezski: thought i was the main character mage on my server, roll tbc and arenas stuck in 2200
[12:52:34] drezski: LUL
[12:52:44] journeygaming3: To me I have a hard time considering full time classic players to be "great players" compared to mythic top10 raiders
[12:52:52] drezski: literally humbled
[12:52:56] journeygaming3: So when it comes to arguing who are good and not its kinda redundant
[12:53:56] journeygaming3: Anyone can parse 99 in classic, but few people will invent new routes I guess is why I think they are good
[12:54:41] kenosqt: link to mage video plz?
[12:55:11] journeygaming3: Its keyvan video if u want the mage boost video
[12:55:40] journeygaming3: I understand bro, to you 99.9% of players are bad players
[12:55:57] qbatrGG: @journeygaming3 statistically yes?
[12:56:02] lars1990111: small pepe
[12:56:13] journeygaming3: Not really
[12:56:14] drezski: lfm wsg primate must have tabard, 9/9 gnomer, link dmg meters &  achievements from cata
[12:56:31] journeygaming3: I just find it different between great and good
[12:56:44] Releaserage: 1 of 5 EZ
[12:56:47] MJ_z1: im good FeelsBadMan
[12:56:48] journeygaming3: I'd say 60% of classic is bad players, 30% are good, and 10% are great
[12:56:51] asapblocktv: 2/10
[12:57:17] hodgey___: theres no good players in classic
[12:57:38] journeygaming3: I mean you say you are the greatest and at the same time you say you are bad
[12:57:40] kenosqt: depends on how you do define being good
[12:57:41] journeygaming3: So its hard to take it seriously
[12:57:41] Erik24: confirmed bad, didnt have bandages
[12:57:51] Varrii: @journeygaming3 relative to what? Runescape?
[12:57:54] MJ_z1: i played with you in 15cent's raid and couldnt outpreform you
[12:57:58] lars1990111: u can eat ppl we forgive u
[12:58:09] journeygaming3: Okay
[12:58:15] journeygaming3: You said no1 could do the mara pull like you
[12:58:18] Erik24: i thought u said u were the greatest with mara pulls 500? or no
[12:58:20] journeygaming3: And you also said
[12:58:31] Wiggen_: #reddit
[12:58:32] journeygaming3: When you put time into things you would improve them
[12:58:35] Erik24: tell me im wrong
[12:58:37] journeygaming3: Like the cath pull
[12:58:43] iNSANEono: forsenY i need a new hobby
[12:58:54] Turektio: PogO
[12:58:55] journeygaming3: But if no1 can do it like you, doesnt that by definition make you the best?
[12:58:56] journeygaming3: I dont get it
[12:58:59] Erik24: u said the greatest with mara ? no one could sompete with u
[13:00:07] journeygaming3: Oh well, doesn't matter. It seems im starting to piss you off a bit, so ill lay off
[13:00:36] switchz3: hey brother hope you're having a good stream, mind showing spec/runes?
[13:00:50] journeygaming3: I just defined it as being the best, when you are nr1 at something you are the best in my book
[13:00:57] hadouken300: ronaldo and messi are not that great either because not that many people even play football ?
[13:01:36] Releaserage: bange
[13:01:37] Releaserage: r
[13:01:48] Erik24: messi only parses 99, his shit
[13:02:08] dumbneko: you will win that game for sure bro
[13:02:14] dumbneko: ?
[13:02:27] journeygaming3: But saying there is only 50 people boosting maraudon is not honest is it
[13:02:29] yoloswagerzx: thats why u play vanilla and not retail axaxaxaxaxax
[13:02:32] yoloswagerzx: big brain there
[13:03:58] iNSANEono: approach from river, turnin is instant, then run
[13:03:58] switchz3: anyone know what rune he running
[13:04:41] yoloswagerzx: same as you brahette
[13:04:47] journeygaming3: It doesn't offend, I just doubt that people will imrpove his runs so vastly like you seem to think they would
[13:05:11] yoloswagerzx: praise the dog never forget BlackLivesMatter
[13:05:19] journeygaming3: Maybe slightly optimisting it, but I dont think they will improve it that much ,mara is an outlier
[13:05:26] iNSANEono: ok cancelled on twitter
[13:05:30] cosmicoriginz: KKonaW too far
[13:06:17] journeygaming3: I never take offense to anything
[13:06:32] journeygaming3: I just dont agree with everything
[13:06:46] journeygaming3: Doesn't mean im right, but it is what it is
[13:07:25] journeygaming3: Yea I figured you dont have much of a filter, which is refreshing in its own way
[13:07:26] drezski: as you should
[13:08:06] journeygaming3: Fair enough
[13:08:43] Mihjei: do you tell them what they could do instead?
[13:09:25] journeygaming3: We know bro lol
[13:09:35] journeygaming3: We can tell by the tone of your voice that you really wnat to tell us how u feel sometimes
[13:09:35] swdrip: he used to drop n bombs in discord
[13:09:50] swdrip: like all eu kids
[13:10:34] journeygaming3: You dont sound very russian, never would have guessed
[13:10:59] hodgey___: the demons tizz

[13:12:30] swdrip: in canada yes
[13:12:30] raivven933: in GER it is
[13:12:32] journeygaming3: you will get illegally handled
[13:12:38] swdrip: hate speech
[13:12:40] journeygaming3: not the police
[13:12:42] journeygaming3: lol.
[13:12:49] drezski: ello govn'a u got a loicense for dat nword?
[13:12:51] yaugerz: depends on the context, if its directed against someone it can cause problem for you
[13:13:03] stuttersx: could be considered a "hate crime" technically. unless you are just randomly saying it
[13:13:24] ChristusRex: it is not
[13:13:31] ChristusRex: its protected under free speech
[13:13:45] basedguy123_: if u bash someone and call someone a F while doing it its a hate crime
[13:13:45] Sowiloo: except if you talk agaisnt putin
[13:13:48] Sowiloo: KEKL
[13:13:59] journeygaming3: Yea but balkan countries are rough people lol
[13:14:08] jcramer234: You can call the police names in US
[13:14:12] journeygaming3: I used to raid in full balkan guild, no1 had a filter
[13:14:34] Releaserage: you can call the police a horse cock in their face and its okay from a place in my country LUL
[13:14:38] journeygaming3: you needed thick skin in that guild
[13:15:44] journeygaming3: Outside of the balkan countries, most people are not like that lol
[13:17:55] jhk97: er
[13:17:55] jcramer234: level up
[13:18:34] jcramer234: Only in sub aniversary
[13:18:39] jcramer234: I speak the truth
[13:18:47] journeygaming3: maelstrom enhancer is nice in the open world, perma uptime with free heals
[13:19:18] journeygaming3: I stack it to 5 in like 4 seconds
[13:19:20] journeygaming3: with dualwield
[13:19:21] toonits: hows ele in gnomer?
[13:19:24] journeygaming3: constantly free spells
[13:19:35] journeygaming3: but I cant find any weakauras for the maelstrom buff to keep track which sucks
[13:20:08] journeygaming3: with flurry and dualwield rune so stormstrike hits twice you stack it so fast
[13:20:43] journeygaming3: haha wtf
[13:21:55] journeygaming3: I think in 1v1 enhance can be super strong if u can stick to people
[13:22:00] journeygaming3: Like you will outsustain anyone
[13:22:18] journeygaming3: I heal like 700 every 4 seconds with maelstrom
[13:22:20] katujal: ele is rly good in pvp tho
[13:22:21] journeygaming3: instant healing wave
[13:22:22] Hiawataa: Aint wow down for maintaince?
[13:22:47] journeygaming3: Like I said, If I can stick to them, but I know its not gonna be reality
[13:23:36] journeygaming3: frost shock, totem projection with grounding will help to stick to them a bit
[13:23:53] journeygaming3: earthbind* not grounding
[13:24:21] journeygaming3: Mages seem pretty easy, just having grounding and rank1 earth shock for polymorph
[13:24:23] Releaserage: gz PogChamp
[13:24:25] journeygaming3: And grounding + purge
[13:24:38] journeygaming3: Hunters are impossible though
[13:24:56] stuttersx: ret?
[13:25:06] warlordfearsome: so those are the 3 best classes?
[13:25:11] journeygaming3: So far in open world I seem to kill anything except prenerf balance druids
[13:25:15] journeygaming3: But that doesnt say much
[13:25:22] journeygaming3: Vs good players its a differnet story
[13:25:45] Meggozz1: lol
[13:25:55] Meggozz1: any mage can delete u
[13:26:16] Biohazzard567: @Lmgd1 starsurge nerfed brother, let us rejoice
[13:26:47] journeygaming3: When I get on top of people they are dead in like 2 seconds
[13:27:29] journeygaming3: They said further class balanced on the 20th
[13:27:29] Releaserage: ingame ofc Kappa
[13:27:33] journeygaming3: What do you think they will adjust?
[13:27:36] Biohazzard567: time to one shot now as ele
[13:27:58] journeygaming3: Yea but they said they will adjust more classes on the 20th febuary
[13:28:23] journeygaming3: They did 2x pyroblast dmg at instant cast, with 6 sec cd
[13:28:27] Biohazzard567: starsurge should not be able to benefit from the starfire stun effect
[13:29:30] journeygaming3: I reckon enhancement will get buffed, being second worst dps atm
[13:30:18] Meggozz1: BLIZZARD  ALSO GIVE SHAMANS WOTLK TOTEMS WHEN U CAN PRESS TOTEM BUTTON ON SILENCE EFFECT…
[13:30:33] journeygaming3: I saw some sims I think
[13:30:38] journeygaming3: And frost mage was worst, and then enhancer
[13:31:06] journeygaming3: I got a warcraftlogs link
[13:31:09] journeygaming3: With the sims
[13:31:15] Biohazzard567: flame shock 30yd range would be insane
[13:31:16] journeygaming3: For gnomer
[13:31:37] icnivadoelx: IKEK
[13:32:02] cosmicoriginz: HUH expose
[13:32:07] journeygaming3: You want link for class performance for gnomer so far?
[13:32:12] journeygaming3: melee hunter in the top, frost mage bottom
[13:32:12] Biohazzard567: 20 yard range in wow is literally like 5 steps from melee range
[13:32:34] Biohazzard567: @Lmgd1 I am agreeing with you brother im just saying it would be amazing
[13:32:54] Sowiloo: 80 yards would be dope
[13:33:19] Meggozz1: What do u think about mage water? only 2 atm u can craft at once LUL LUL
[13:33:25] Meggozz1: because OP
[13:34:10] cosmicoriginz: nah just buy your own water
