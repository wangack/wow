[1:31:40] Eny192: is there talent / conduit page for the players like in AWC?
[1:31:42] Xinthas: @Yumx well yeah, but perfect gameplay (like in awc) is probably just a little less entertaining because everything is accounted for (usually)
[1:31:45] ledster305: dude im just my ipunuon
[1:31:59] loveshock7: go go @Zenlyn ,3 <3
[1:32:04] ledster305: opinion is double rogue in 3s = dead heals

[1:35:30] its_mike: Ngl if trille had better comps he probably woulda gone 6-0 too but niksi has had all great comps
[1:35:32] ConcernedGaming: @Peapod_pocket_squirrel They do, the UI is just bad
[1:35:32] emergence_fi: yeah they need to fix cds tracking
[1:35:35] boufunq: Yeah he won on rogue mage, since Niksi got 5/5 win
[1:35:36] Eny192: @Peapod_pocket_squirrel they do, just UI not refreshing

[2:03:51] elvenrosevt: dk did not use death grip waaaa
[2:03:54] SweatyDaniels: I think that a flaw with solo shuffle is the dps gets shuffled more relative to healers.  Feels like there could be a way to rate more healers in a larger pool and get more randomness

[2:05:03] bingo5557: hopefully all Blizzard esports will be back on Twitch when Youtube deal expires in december

[2:59:23] StarShopping95: These are two like actual comps LUL
[2:59:23] luthe_sr: @Phaeris2020 and yet, affliction is considered pretty weak in pvp
[2:59:37] Xinthas: @Phaeris2020 clearly doesn't lol
[2:59:40] morgott21: @indingoh they can always make abilities deal different amount of damage in pve and pvp

[3:04:13] lovermangeniusx: Zeepee main elemental shaman
[3:04:16] AbieCherry: @aknon yeah lmao
[3:04:16] Garakk: tonys in trouble
[3:04:20] Seriouslywtfx: @Showduh  Yes I understand that, I think it would be helpful for viewers if they provided better introduction commentary.  Bc watchinng wow pvp is hard even if u know the cloasses etc
[3:04:29] dabbitx: i feel like only the top and most skilled pvpers are playing...unforunately lower level people like nahj arent invited
[3:04:50] Meridius_X: @V_Saurfang decent. better burst, worse survivability.
[3:04:54] Xinthas: @iir3dbaronii yeah, every streamer and their mum are streaming classic now, the content is so boring too.

[3:05:54] leeka: I thought drinking didnt work in regen mana in solo shuffle?
[3:05:54] troopmonk: @Seriouslywtfx not really :D
[3:05:55] dabbitx: @aknon nahj is a much lower level r1 player compared to trill or drake
[3:05:58] katsoudasp: nerf mage pls
[3:06:02] CaafeTV: tony feral >>>>>>>>
[3:06:08] dabbitx: even palumor has more skill/exp
[3:06:12] StarShopping95: @Seriouslywtfx for sure haha. I think that's an issue with WoW arena in general though that unless you play it can be difficult to tell what's going on outside of watching hp bars.

[3:06:51] stOgey: buff fire mage obv Kappa
[3:06:59] dabbitx: @aknon yea hes not at the skill level of other r1s but hes good compared to the average 1800 player
[3:06:59] Garakk: @NakSFC SMOrc WAT RONG WITH ORK?
[3:07:00] demdanx: stream sniping
[3:07:11] Hiraad: raiku should go venthyr frost for consistent dmg

[3:07:47] worthtv: Every team
[3:07:52] aknoN: @dabbitx ok now you're trolling lol  i'll stick to commenting on this match, I don't have the time in my life to downplay others.
[3:08:02] fr0z3n_rulz: @bbeeeef I see whaazz on discord with the guys just changing depending with whom they play
[3:08:12] PunkhoodTV: kek
[3:08:37] gidzlol: Raiku should just respec Frost
[3:08:43] dabbitx: its based on rating and past exp. nahj does not qualify
[3:08:44] Garakk: 33% damps
[3:08:44] morgott21: surv hunters have mortal strike effect?
[3:08:47] gidzlol: Fire has one comp and that's it
[3:08:54] lovermangeniusx: kinda lame if they are all on discord
[3:08:58] Shailax: this just shows how bad mage is without a rogue
[3:09:07] ArneTheMarker: @morgott21 their pet does
[3:09:10] Garakk: damp going nuts now
[3:09:11] PunkhoodTV: indeed fire is kinda bad
[3:09:13] Hiraad: @lovermangeniusx agree
[3:09:16] InNecoVeritas: @lovermangeniusx wat
[3:09:19] HibyPrime: do these players have voice chat?

[3:09:28] lovermangeniusx: doesnt show an accurate representation of solo shuffle for us as the other 99% of the playerbase
[3:09:29] fr0z3n_rulz: problem is that blizzard optimise characters around 3vs3 and now there is huge gap vs some classes
[3:09:29] gorilahazed: beansWalk

[3:10:36] loveshock7: @vojinzi would be dope
[3:10:39] OuJi_TV: Raiku in honor gear
[3:10:40] morgott21: raiku is that guy you see in your solo shuffle and know you are gonna lose the round
[3:10:44] lovermangeniusx: if you think people arent higher rated than you without comms then i dunno what to tell you
[3:10:45] 08ponic: lol raiku knows where whaaz hides
[3:10:48] Zetherior: @Myth_The_Wolf +1
[3:10:49] Ambersulfr: arcane would at least be fun while you're dying.
[3:10:50] worthtv: @lovermangeniusx Says the 2.1 player
[3:10:54] Xinthas: this tournament is exposing the big flaw of soloshuffle though, it's clear that some classes just have way better synergy with different comps than other classes (like firemage)
[3:10:56] jammygreg: WHERES reeceb1Gigapala
[3:11:01] deanoxs: frost would be much better imo

[3:11:25] MeetMee_: I accly love the pase turmanets are going for wow now every weeks somthing new i accly love it . At this rate this game will be great again !
[3:11:29] lovermangeniusx: even if i was 2.1k rated, thats higher than most people that pvp
[3:11:29] InNecoVeritas: @Xinthas No way, some classes are better than others in certain scenarios? No shot
[3:11:32] 08ponic: @lovermangeniusx what
[3:11:35] Zetherior: @Xinthas thats not a flaw, it is getting a spec specific ladder, so youll only be ranked against others of the same spec

[3:13:21] Birthdayy: @xinthas fire mage excels in setup comps lol. It’s Much harder to setup with no coms and no rogue triple cheap shotting everything for you. Also these are all R1 and world champion players.  If there are any gaps in CC They will punish the enemy team or react properly.

[3:19:46] D4GO0: Tonyyyyyyyy
[3:19:48] Myth_The_Wolf: No, voice comms doesn't ruin it when everyone has access to them
[3:19:57] D4GO0: ;0
[3:20:01] lovermangeniusx: if people want to sweat, someone will make a discord server for solo queue and people will jump in if they want
[3:20:10] jammygreg: @loveshock7 the game changes v quick
