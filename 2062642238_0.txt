[2:44:45] typer___iban: i was lv38 when i realized that there was basically no difference between that and 40, except raid
[2:44:49] stuffe92: as mage u just need like 15 silver Coins
[2:44:51] roxaz_chachvm: what are the rewards for blood moon
[2:44:54] Leobeans: lol that look over
[2:45:05] pmanfit91: You get more blood based off of the actions taken during combat. For example, if a healer in your group is drinking.. they don't get any.
[2:45:06] prismoytt: timeless isle vibes
[2:45:12] Klkpalomo13: hows your day everyone ? hope you guys having a good day today :)
[2:45:12] skillsetzero: does Shannon sit next to you?

[2:45:16] shiavux: @stuffe92 not if u go for mount tho
[2:45:19] Tenzo1o1: is the event better today? yesterday it was a lag fest and layering nightmare
[2:45:28] Plakes027: !server
[2:45:29] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[2:45:36] UnsafeCell: It would be a good content Xaryu and Mitch do a 5 mage bloodmoon at 40
[2:45:42] mandl: @Tenzo1o1 the last EU one was pretty bad.
[2:45:51] typer___iban: @prism_ike not yet, this is week2 of week long lockout
[2:46:08] 94explorer: the event is zero fun when its laggy
[2:46:11] OrganikCum: yea overwhelming when too many groups are around
[2:46:14] prism_ike: oh weird
[2:46:15] gmazca: Our group went in after the event started and got layered and split up
[2:46:19] drewboy29: i tried this yesterday and got killed on spawn for like 15 mins straight
[2:46:21] prism_ike: @prism_ike when does the weeklyu lockout end
[2:46:23] Nelox96: It
[2:46:28] Aphotixc: It's fun as ranged class. Melee not as much
[2:46:28] Nelox96: It's fun until you lag KEKW
[2:46:39] get_me_0ut: or improve servers
[2:46:43] evil_tree: Will you be my valentine @Xaryu
[2:46:46] ninetysix: nah that fucks groups up
[2:46:52] Mokanshu: then you run into ashenvale layering shenanigans all over again
[2:46:52] asloff: what about a layer for parties and a layer for solo players?
[2:46:56] Dimpleshift: @Xaryu That wouldnt be fun for the only 50 players on the second layer tho
[2:46:56] dlb_darkness: I haven't ran this event yet. What is the goal?
[2:47:10] Mokanshu: @dlb_darkness kill everyone dont die
[2:47:10] lambda__function: @get_me_0ut hes not saying bc of lag, but bc of density. just gets too chaotic
[2:47:12] harmingone: you have to start new layers before one is filled so you dont have 600 people playing and 4 people excluded bc of the "technology"
[2:47:12] typer___iban: @prism_ike on tuesday it goes to 3day lockouts
[2:47:17] typer___iban: iirc
[2:47:25] tophe_r: Should have helped topher find his plums
[2:47:46] asloff: I think having separate layers for groups and solo players would be the move
[2:47:51] typer___iban: maybe its next thurs because p2 came out on a thurs, but dont think so
[2:47:54] adeeoe: xaryu still on that corporal because of the dishonorable kill :D
[2:47:57] Lamspread: Lamspread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! :)
[2:48:02] Paladez: i wonder... what is the point of the satchels that the vendor sells? like for 1 silver u buy a satchel that contains 100 blood copper which = 1 silver, why even buy the satchel since it binds on pickup?
[2:48:35] Dinomight3: gear
[2:48:40] Shunmao: Paladez to have only one type of coin in your bag
[2:48:42] Royal_Mail: Bro my homunculi got me a DK and i was so pissed KEKW

[2:48:43] kickflipy: it will in the future
[2:48:45] ziloxity_: still level 35 cuh? (im still 25)
[2:48:45] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: except the rewards, yeah
[2:48:46] markusgg_: rank 14 now is easier to get @Xaryu
[2:48:47] geminuspr: @Paladez guess if u want to buy something that costs silver and u only have a gold coin u can break it
[2:48:50] terengee: you want the new trinket
[2:48:51] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu you want the new trinket and gear later
[2:48:52] lambda__function: @Paladez lets say you have 1g coin, and you want to buy something that costs 1s. you gotta be able to concert gold back to silver coins
[2:48:53] markusgg_: rank 14 gear
[2:48:55] ipetam: 100%
[2:48:56] Vesir_1: its for the gear
[2:48:56] markusgg_: by 60 fresh
[2:48:58] yapercaper: the rank just represents a diff thing
[2:49:03] harmingone: It was fun to get rank 14 once, but never gaain
[2:49:03] adeeoe: true that
[2:49:05] encrypteddeath: that's how I felt from an arena point of view.
[2:49:06] Paladez: ahh i see that makes sense
[2:49:06] yapercaper: time vs skill
[2:49:07] inspect4: there will most likely be new gear for sod
[2:49:12] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: the trinket
[2:49:13] Wulf760: yea I wouldn't care either if I had a DK
[2:49:14] Zeppehhh92: Is it a big grind for 1 blood Gold?
[2:49:17] ttvtracerg: @harmingone SPOT ON
[2:49:18] chamlet2764: but does it look cool
[2:49:20] ddraggbagg: Need the PVP trinket for sure which is ranking based
[2:49:24] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: you get a real pvp trinket at r5
[2:49:24] markusgg_: not till aq 40 @Xaryu
[2:49:24] prismoytt: the vendor gear is good for leveling up
[2:49:26] kickflipy: set bonus
[2:49:29] gmazca: not sure for sod gear
[2:49:30] baldanduseless: its a grind to do
[2:49:33] Erixx: how long is this event for?
[2:49:38] fallen1881: i think its nice to know if someone has some pvp exp compared to some that may not have any
[2:49:40] typer___iban: you can get rank gear faster because you're closer to the rank and not RNG

[3:05:31] asloff: @Babobop yeah chris
[3:05:47] adeeoe: 899 was it
[3:05:49] rombeca: 8-900
[3:05:53] tophe_r: its not like im actually doing anything besides feeding blood lol i dont get the salt
[3:06:01] Corwynn_2: why dont you covert those to silver
[3:06:03] Staltrin: whats ur talents
[3:06:19] 94explorer: @tophe_r pretty sure it was a joke man, not that deep lmao
[3:06:29] tophe_r: oh word
[3:06:31] darthftw: yep
[3:06:41] Babobop: @tophe_r we just fuckin witcha brother
[3:06:50] 94explorer: <3
[3:07:01] darthftw: pepeD
[3:07:24] regulater45: That's pretty nifty being able to heal as a mage
[3:07:29] asloff: Xar apparently you get more coins from kills if you are near the blood troll boss
[3:07:33] M0rley_: If you search for the troll boss and fight in the area where its at you will get a buff that rewards more blood per kill. Ez over 1k per game
[3:07:43] BoonesHQ: cant wait to see you doing this when you are level 40...
[3:07:51] tophe_r: 1min left to get my plums..
[3:08:21] lesley2280: I guess no point in doing solo pvp
[3:08:22] asloff: @tophe_r got 50g for a duel?
[3:08:34] blazzedzz: A Xar Mitch lvl 40 bloodmoon duo would be sooo sick
[3:08:41] UnsafeCell: as a lvl 35
[3:08:41] snowbeezy23: stackin OP classes lol
[3:08:44] iamabirdttv: GOT MY WEP XAR
[3:08:45] iamabirdttv: WOOOOO
[3:08:45] Shway13: been trying to do it solo, its rough lol
[3:08:46] UnsafeCell: must be world first
[3:08:46] SirGrindsAl0t: fun DansGame
[3:08:47] asloff: duel topher now
[3:08:47] caravainilla: I really think this event would be better if they limited you to 2 people per party or something.
[3:08:48] coladonien: yo I was in that “coordinated team” you farmed us F
[3:08:49] baldanduseless: is this napoleon or xaryu?
[3:08:49] gorthymog: nice job xar
[3:08:50] DeathToad007: did they fix the lag?
[3:09:02] stankylank: no xar, only play with bad classes pleases
[3:09:03] espi: no warriors = stacking OP classes
[3:09:03] stankylank: bigbrain
[3:09:05] OrganikCum: was it better than killing a big pve boss in 20 seconds though?
[3:09:07] Neophyterr: priest still insane dmg
[3:09:11] pho_rilla: work hours arent too bad
[3:09:19] neighbor220: no, it was really laggy right now
[3:09:35] RudyRube: The will never "fix the lag".  Lagging with more than 150-200 people in visual range will lag Classic.  Always has, always will
[3:09:36] lolo40001: ranged seems better than melee in this event overall
[3:09:40] seancyx: night time is when most people play and the experience is  ruined
[3:09:42] marius402: I am 40 died like 30 times, tons of rogues, that just one shot u
[3:09:46] marius402: meh
[3:09:53] blazzedzz: Sadge I have a job
[3:09:58] Bigblox: WoW has a lag problem and it's unfortunate that for whatever reason it seems to not be fixable :(
[3:09:59] pho_rilla: i wonder if just getting rid of all mobs in the area would help with lag or if it solely bassed on players
[3:10:03] bn6mz: this aint fun when ur solo
[3:10:08] asloff: Xar, next blood moon you should find the troll boss, kills near him give more coins
[3:10:13] matheusin_42: i wish they changed it to only solo
[3:10:16] ferknasty: just got 200 copper as a war and mage baby
[3:10:16] garbage003: What up XAR!!  how is baby XAR doing?
[3:10:18] SirGrindsAl0t: fun DansGame
[3:10:21] ferknasty: actually enjoying itr
[3:10:23] gorthymog: everyon needs to stop BITCHING.

[3:10:47] bn6mz: Xar whats your thoughts on priests in p2?
[3:10:51] makkaen: most ppl just suffer through that for sure, for items
[3:10:52] Zonex2004: Your name is Josh
[3:10:53] renebabeCoC: he is near the arena
[3:10:53] pho_rilla: monkaW
[3:10:53] detourz28: At night with lag it's unplayable. Sad.
[3:10:54] Dinomight3: he gets ears if he kills people lol
[3:10:55] asloff: he patrols
[3:10:55] capisun523: THat boss is insane
[3:10:56] tophe_r: He roams, usually near mid
[3:10:57] mrwaddles22: near areana
[3:10:57] renebabeCoC: gurubashi arena

[3:11:19] Joxtirol: he spawn at random alter
[3:11:20] batchestspam: @Xaryu get missile barrage yet?
[3:11:33] Amo_Fresh: jesus u have alot of viewers you deserve it all xaryu
[3:11:38] tophe_r: ggs Xaryu, I will get my plums back one day
[3:11:45] Zonex2004: Flare why?
[3:11:49] adam_brisbane: if you want alliance vs horde good pvp go to arena now
[3:11:53] dizze1988: did he just flare you
[3:11:53] coladonien: dude ggs xar that was fun
[3:11:55] tophe_r: xD
[3:11:55] pho_rilla: LOL
[3:11:56] matheusin_42: kind of annoying how good xar is
[3:11:58] newtonowe: Can you explain what this game mode is all about? I am new to it, never played it
[3:12:03] Zellane_TV: @xaryu u ganked me when i was getting a Soul shard from a tiger lol
[3:12:06] Bilzebob: @Xaryu are you drinking any protein shakes?
[3:12:06] Webbyster_: they made xp buff persist through death??
[3:12:08] seamonkie26: I dont see Zulgruub in my realm list
[3:12:09] b1azzuris: cant even feel bad for Xaryu when he gets ganked randomly questing when he does shit like that lmao
[3:12:09] asloff: god, that hunter deadzone makes me sick everytime... xarDownbad
[3:12:11] FATVIRGINMAYOMAN: why are you viewers so upset hes not 40 yet? Maybe he doesnt want to get bored after 1 day played at 40
[3:12:18] tekdubya: this event is dogshit
[3:12:18] Zonex2004: You like it that much huh?
[3:12:19] kickflipy: arenas
[3:12:22] Rypu: @FATVIRGINMAYOMAN im angry 😠 grr
[3:12:23] lambda__function: just do this but in dif zones
[3:12:23] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: duels
[3:12:24] jpayg: ashenvale is dead
[3:12:26] Squid___: Classic+ is the future for sure, OSRS is the model
[3:12:26] baldanduseless: similar concept but more onjectives?
[3:12:27] kindaopmusic: when the lag gets better itll be nice
[3:12:28] tnzpham23: they made the rewards a little too EZ
[3:12:30] kickflipy: arenassss
[3:12:31] adam_brisbane: everyone ends event and tries to get the vendor so they all fight on it
[3:12:32] matheusin_42: make it on a 60 zone
[3:12:33] Pragma8123: Blackrock mountain event
[3:12:33] Lanicor91: there's not enough rewards after a certain point
[3:12:35] renebabeCoC: arenas would be badass
[3:12:38] beastleberry: last night it was terrible. lag was unplayable.
[3:12:39] asloff: @FATVIRGINMAYOMAN we're just trolling him mostly, it's all in good fun
[3:12:41] d0mezg4mer: well the problem is it requires a group, its not free for all its five for all
[3:12:42] grymnyr_: King of the Hill at the towers in plaguelands
[3:12:42] PMA_1: improve EPL
[3:12:42] kief770: they need to have better rewards for turn ins
[3:12:46] encrypteddeath: I wish arenas were in classic
[3:12:47] Ditysalad: this will be dead when everyone has what they want from it
[3:12:48] UnsafeCell: azshara
[3:12:48] jpayg: EPL event would be bis
[3:12:49] Philopinos: needs real pvp zones..
[3:12:52] RudyRube: @Xaryu would be cool if they had 5 factions for event and you "flagged up" for one of them at the start or something
[3:12:53] adeeoe: silithus
[3:12:54] crownhs: Thematically doesn't really fit elsewhere, perhaps make it into a bg
[3:12:56] Bilzebob: hey xar are you using protein shakes for muscle growth?
[3:12:56] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: I would just like to see them have different events for different scales of pvp
[3:12:56] Zonex2004: Do you think there should be different objectives?
[3:12:57] Lanolinlol: isnt there already an event in EPL?
[3:12:57] parkrangerpeter: EPL event should be a horde mode
[3:12:59] parkrangerpeter: against scourge
[3:13:00] baldanduseless: @Xaryu add more to this like giving a bounty to person with most blood etc
[3:13:01] AgentIce99: i want them to make a queue for it, set amount of people, random spawn points
[3:13:04] Scnozzberry: reminds me of timeless isle
[3:13:04] DeathToad007: rings for casters sucks
[3:13:05] tophe_r: Its very impressive to see how fast they are making changes to the event to fix the initial issues
[3:13:06] warringtoad: they need a solo bloodmoon event
[3:13:06] kirk_hunts: This is the most fun event Blizzard has ever made.
[3:13:09] rammd4wg: EPL with tower fortifications would be cool
[3:13:09] adam_brisbane: a bow with agility not strenght would be nice
[3:13:10] Shway13: I think its kinda hard for solo but thats pvp I guess
[3:13:10] FATVIRGINMAYOMAN: @asloff pisses me off that you act like bunch of brat kids watch a man who doesnt not chase meta
[3:13:12] Ophelly: can you go look if the lumber is back?
[3:13:14] newtonowe: Can you explain what this game mode is all about? I am new to it, never played it
[3:13:14] mytownnn: imagine having like tree forts in the trees lol
[3:13:17] renebabeCoC: we need a streamer to lead the SoD arena charge
[3:13:18] kirk_hunts: I wish there was an entire game mode that was just stv pvp event
[3:13:22] j_dillinger777: epicsa re easy to get, we need armor. mounts are just a 100k grindfest
[3:13:25] bluesqusihy: @Xaryu can you show the mounts you can get?
[3:13:26] valentinooo: we want mythic+ Kappa
[3:13:30] afterflossin: not all specs get good epics to be fair
[3:13:31] tophe_r: wPvP is a numbers game everytime
[3:13:34] Shway13: I got like 100 coins as solo
[3:13:35] wreckstormx: he probably wants the items to be better than gnomer gear LUL
[3:13:39] Lanicor91: Rewards are cool but you can get everything you need in a few events, except for the mount which isn't really the appeal for most, perhaps some kind of titles or things that do not really affect power
[3:13:41] d0mezg4mer: I'd prefer if it was truely solo, no groups at all
[3:13:43] chrislu18: i just went in solo and still had fun
[3:13:44] kief770: its to easy to get purples and a lot of people wont grind for mount
[3:13:44] gorthymog: THE REACTION TO THIS EVENT is just a reflection of your IRL Character. Xaryu is grateful, thankful and positive, where the rest of yall like to complain & cry
[3:13:46] Nandrolone11: @Xaryu surprised ur not 40 yet drah
[3:13:47] lampsterof79: We were consitantly fighting a 10 man, not sure what the penalty was
[3:13:48] Aduvanas: @Xaryu Would you enjoy this event if it was stricly SOLO for all?
[3:13:49] bluesqusihy: @Xaryu can you show the mounts you can get? ?
[3:13:52] Mico027: Did they  put back the turning for honor or rep yet?
[3:13:53] AtosL: yo Xar what are we eating?
[3:13:53] UnsafeCell: maybe give 10% buff if you are sololing
[3:13:54] fivetailfox: are you going to by a mount from the event?
[3:13:56] jikorax: Doesn't feel like classic world pvp tho with 5 ppl
[3:14:01] matheusin_42: I'd love it if it was solo, 5 man is a little much still
[3:14:01] kirk_hunts: I wish the rewards were harder to get
[3:14:03] asloff: @FATVIRGINMAYOMAN im sorry you feel that we're too childish FATVIRGINMAYOMAN....
[3:14:05] xfrostlus: it should be limited to groups of 3 durring the event imo
[3:14:06] thebigdongerhere: What u eating
[3:14:06] tophe_r: All I'm saying is I couldnt 1 shot a 35 mage so hunters dont need nerf
[3:14:07] DeathToad007: should be stam gear for gods sake
[3:14:07] newtonowe: Can you explain what this game mode is all about? I am new to it, never played it
[3:14:07] M0rley_: blizz plays alli palli
[3:14:10] adam_brisbane: why should pvp gear not be as good as raid gear?
[3:14:15] kirk_hunts: not cheesing I got all my stuff first day
[3:14:15] bn6mz: not gonna level to 40? XD
[3:14:18] Lanicor91: Perhaps a pvp set or make them harder to get, take longer or give us some titles or a reason to keep coming back
[3:14:18] bluesqusihy: @Xaryu can you show the mounts you can get? ??
[3:14:21] gorthymog: THE REACTION TO THIS EVENT is just a reflection of your IRL Character. Xaryu is grateful, thankful and positive, where the rest of yall like to complain & cry.
[3:14:22] soup_kup_: go sm spam
[3:14:22] capisun523: WHAT
[3:14:23] Lanicor91: i love the event though
[3:14:28] UnsafeCell: you can convert them into silver btw
[3:14:30] j_dillinger777: you need 100000
[3:14:32] tophe_r: Xaryu going for world LAST 40 mage
[3:14:32] bottis96: what if it layered to keep even number alliance vs hoard
[3:14:36] thebigdongerhere: What mount is it
[3:14:37] ghuevo: the rewards for hunters are ass
[3:14:37] detourz28: I think groups should be debuffed scaling to size. Making solo more incentivized. It's a cool event either way.
[3:14:38] packtar: convert them to silver to save space
[3:14:38] kickflipy: you need to convert your coins
[3:14:41] jpayg: its 100k lol
[3:14:45] booker105: is it 100%
[3:14:52] Xenocide321: 100k
[3:14:57] tophe_r: the bow is actually sick for melee hunter as the bonus procs from melee too
[3:14:59] newtonowe: Can you explain what this game mode is all about? I am new to it, never played it
[3:15:00] Doctorbac0n: oh hes clean with it

[4:15:12] GalapagosPlays: what dungeon do i spam at 30 bros
[4:15:13] squarepusher_: It's an unused asset. This one is fine.
[4:15:19] Chomaxx: agreed
[4:15:19] hogantheyoung: that dud tried to sell his account i believe
[4:15:20] xTravvvvv: didnt the guy who got it try to sell his account and get it removed anyway?
[4:15:24] chadbingles: great reference
[4:15:25] obajawanke: i throw up a lil everytime i see a tauren on that mount
[4:15:25] Snorlax_King: leaked twitch drop??

[4:16:05] roxaz_chachvm: i am upset about it
[4:16:07] biki2112: you need to defeat the last two bosses without leaving combat to get it
[4:16:08] dizzlethebot: mechanostrider is most annoying mount anyway
[4:16:08] themanjake2020: Sounds good
[4:16:09] biki2112: its hard
[4:16:10] SpaceCowboy0811: W

[4:16:16] MrPankratz: i think its cool

[4:16:17] SirGrindsAl0t: KEKW

[4:16:26] KosmicDevil_: I hope the add the tiger mount from the myths back in the day
[4:16:27] Warchrist_: wow have alot of this easter egg
[4:16:27] LJimbox: anyone know much about Disc PVP in SoD/Classic? Should i be gearing +healing or +SpellPower ?
[4:16:27] Totsku: dont care if it stays in SoD
[4:16:34] marius402: very fine
[4:16:35] GigaCk: buff wars and im fine
[4:16:38] ThisGuyisLocal: i wish they'd put stuff in similar to mop clear gnomer in a certain amount of time and get X
[4:16:39] tcg_caravan: Do you think a spectral tiger will be a twitch drop in the future?
[4:16:40] Snorlax_King: they should add dragon riding to SoD
[4:16:41] SleeplezzViking: Dont care mount is for move speed
[4:16:41] dan_mcpherson: i think it's really cool, unless i don't get it
[4:16:42] Ubaftw: 10g recipe

[4:16:51] matheusin_42: sod IS for fun, so yeah
[4:16:54] Alfacor: Hey warriors in chat, do you recommend fury or arms for SoD p2?
[4:16:57] limburgse: its SoD babyy <3
[4:17:02] gary_ontwitch: for all intents and purposes, this is a brand new mount for SoD
[4:17:02] MrPankratz: if they will reintroduce things like that? im on the board
[4:17:04] vas7_live: after getting squshed in levels AND gold, you dont feel anything LUL
[4:17:11] juugin26: what are your professions?
[4:17:13] JeebieTheSwampSage: I think new cool mounts should be an expensive gold sink rather than one-time dual spec being a hefty gold sink
[4:17:21] avenomxx: what mount is coming?
[4:17:24] gary_ontwitch: pure W yea
[4:17:28] ChubbsZ: Imagine if they release the warglaive that was showed on the box. Since they are releasing old lore and stuiff
[4:17:29] Reaperz_kinetic: it’s also in a COMPLETELY separate version of wow from the OG which is actually gone because the owner of the ONE AND ONLY green strider was banned
[4:17:31] Thrively: has anyone actually seen this mount?
[4:17:33] MightyCactus1: The player was able to keep it, until they tried to sell their account for crazy money. Then blizz intervened
[4:17:33] Tal_NeonFlame: Guys am I imagining it or do Gnomes have actually lower camera angles in classic ?
[4:17:34] obajawanke: i think its like them rereleasing spectral tiger
[4:17:35] tuna_sandw1ch: how do you feel about calzones
[4:17:35] Karimineel14: would love it if they added more mounts as dungeon drops
[4:17:44] Okiswan: for all intensive purposes
[4:18:01] TakyonTriple654rkedTongue: @tuna_sandw1ch i have a love hate relationship with them and right now i love them
[4:18:07] Purplexxityy: id like them to add a couple fun mounts to sod
[4:18:11] asloff: what about a spectral tiger with like 4wings? an updated model*
[4:18:13] Reaperz_kinetic: plus the only guy who ever got that mount was banned forever soooo there aren’t any in the game anymore
[4:18:16] chauroon: I’m curious what your thoughts are on the black market auction house @xaryu
[4:18:22] tuna_sandw1ch: @TakyonTriple654rkedTongue same, all depends on whos making them too
[4:18:29] Flamexl01: why alliance players so rude? they just camp my body 4 levels up
[4:18:29] chadbingles: tbf who wouldn't!
[4:18:30] asloff: nah it got deleted
[4:18:32] PeeDub1969: It's like Clamweaver Tunic
[4:18:39] TakyonTriple654rkedTongue: @tuna_sandw1ch depends on how fat i am currently LUL

[4:18:57] xking_kano_coc: You can go sm spellcleave grp.its the fastest leveling currently
[4:18:57] Nezzy243: prob same thing with the glaive rogue back in TBC
[4:18:59] GigaCk: kk
[4:19:01] Sciezz: wassup xar?
[4:19:07] Thrively: only 35?
[4:19:07] petronasmercedes: We here
[4:19:08] TakyonTriple654rkedTongue: @tuna_sandw1ch i like making my own
[4:19:11] Reaperz_kinetic: @asloff no he successfully sold it but his account was banned and it was removed 😂 so he won the situation but its all fucked
[4:19:14] lukemeleney: how'd you get an overlay that says 35 when you're definitely level 40 by now?
[4:19:23] Corwynn_2: only lvl 35 cuh?
[4:19:25] Thrively: hahah :D
[4:19:34] Tsmalls777: would you be cool with a scarab lord type quest to get spectral tiger? something super long and difficult
[4:19:35] tha_wicked: 5Head
[4:19:36] asloff: @Reaperz_kinetic ok he got paid, but the mount was lost was my point
[4:19:38] Loodimus: I don't feel like its that crazy lol so many people are 40 already
[4:19:42] roxaz_chachvm: @Corwynn_2 he be slackin bruh on gang

[4:20:37] Seronem0: xar invested into 100 spectral tigers? :D
[4:20:38] wippie__: they should put in a discovery that gives a mount, only 1 per server
[4:20:39] voltrix07: @Xaryu you ever hurt ur knee from working it? just injured mine it stinks not being active man :/

[5:43:04] Iol007: is each blood 1 copper coin?
[5:43:11] Mazuii: Hows the xp doing this event?
[5:43:17] LyteKrame: level 40 is overrated amirite?
[5:43:24] pho_rilla: getting new dedicated servers for SoD would have been a great way to test newer, better servers
[5:43:27] americanbornchild: BabyRage
[5:43:29] KairuruTV: we never have lag on our smaller server
[5:43:37] pkb8: damn xar already lvl 36 ur going quick!
[5:43:38] espi: 500 would be empty
[5:43:42] obajawanke: the event would also have far less pvp encounters
[5:43:46] TransMutedMaya: theMove
[5:43:48] fakeGrimes: then you would never play with your party
[5:43:48] syleion111: 1500
[5:43:53] x_praxy_x: Is it possible that theres more people than all the layers can handle?
[5:43:56] crownhs: It would make the less populated zones dead
[5:43:58] gmazca: need more layers, but also make sure you can join the same layer as your party
[5:43:58] pho_rilla: just make a 50v50 instanced event.
[5:43:59] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: are layers zone specific?
[5:43:59] handovdoom666: there should just be tech that if you are in a group you can't get layered from each other
[5:43:59] bigwuzzy: but they remove layers for the event. Thats the problem
[5:43:59] shadowstorm_sod: To many layers and people r going to bitch they can't find anyone
[5:44:01] shipy14: your assuming all 500 would be doing the event
[5:44:02] retgarr: layers are worldwide
[5:44:04] King_Self: 500 per layer is good
[5:44:08] Faltteri: just put all 3000 players in the same layer
[5:44:17] crownhs: Perhaps change layers to be zone-wide
[5:44:18] society1121: if there was like a central go-to pvp spot then 500 would be fine but nah
[5:44:18] Webbyster_: @pho_rilla the whole point of these events is to be world pvp lmfaoo
[5:44:33] pho_rilla: @pho_rilla yeah and it clearly isnt working for 2 phases now.
[5:44:41] maxjwalther: Have you been 36 for 4 days now?
[5:44:42] swyftboi: Techinically speaking: What's a layer? Are they all on their own VDIs?
[5:44:43] Nellz3r: xar have you tried the full arcane build running arcane surge + missile barrage?
[5:44:47] x_praxy_x: the servers are going crazy theres too many people to layer.
[5:44:51] Nellz3r: Nellz3r subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 4 month streak! heyoo
[5:44:53] strakatak: why isn't there a same layer button?
[5:44:55] roztoky: What is layering when was it implemented?
[5:44:57] john_boxcars: does sod need a wintergrasp?
[5:44:58] enqubas: They should just allow players to join a queue and phase into a  new STV battleground that is 5v5v5 only and has like 200 groups.
[5:45:04] john_boxcars: maybe sod needs a wintergrasp
[5:45:04] Grooveii: anyone experienced event bugging ? I straight up solo killed ppl and got 0 coins, didnt show no debuff or anything as far as I could see
[5:45:06] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: with people popping between layers it makes me think they're trying to tweak things to fix the lag
[5:45:08] LyteKrame: unfortunately they need to make it almost instanced of like 100 or whatever
[5:45:16] scoutbeans: i am loving frost atm
[5:45:37] bbox16: missile barrage pops off
[5:45:38] pho_rilla: they either need to make it instanced or get new servers there isnt much work around
[5:45:49] fofito369: Arcane mage sounds perfect for fast matches like an arena
[5:45:52] Playonwordz: @Xaryu is there a link to your pvp build?
[5:45:54] YouGotSquat: Th3 healer prob got layered to a less populated layer, you should make him invite you all to his layer
[5:45:58] trmonx: too few people would be lame too it needs to ahve this chaos
[5:46:00] Slaughter13x: fire warlock has been gnarly @xaryu
[5:46:01] Nellz3r: seems like with missile barrage you can actually do really good sustained damage and leave arcane surge for a last resort
[5:46:14] Wyant69: @xar You still on track for Gnomer on friday???
[5:46:15] Smidz_: I'm playing missile barrage with arcane, sure i can pop someone every 3 minutes, but the dps outside of cooldowns is still nutty
[5:46:24] lukemeleney: woah
[5:46:27] Amhs: Triple bloods if you fight near boss!
[5:46:28] Herby_Here: that guy fucks
[5:46:29] brawnybravo: 3mil health
[5:46:29] kuroxd2: how is warrior looking?
[5:46:30] brawnybravo: no
[5:46:31] Libertas09: Boss gets string of ears thats awesome
[5:46:32] pho_rilla: monkaW
[5:46:32] VZLAV: uwu whats this

[5:47:10] fijimann: ya last night it was so bad
[5:47:11] fofito369: announce server restart
[5:47:11] detourz28: This is how it was for me yesterday and i was like nah. Totally unplayable
[5:47:11] Elsevier86: make your game crap so less people play it
[5:47:12] Nezzy243: its blizzard, theyre not doing anything about it
[5:47:13] iggiyoo: delete all npcs during event
[5:47:14] Uncle_Mitchy: i wonder if this is a crusader strike problem
[5:47:14] amexpog: I invest money into a better server infrastructure @Xaryu
[5:47:16] Saintsg9: prob to many players
[5:47:16] SavageSeb_: Instanced PvP Events with limited people

[5:47:19] b_argy: layers is all you can do right?
[5:47:19] gmazca: last night was bad too

[5:47:21] tuna_sandw1ch: re log
[5:47:21] shalzuth: you should try layerings into not this layer
[5:47:22] b_argy: idk
[5:47:22] DBGmal: so laggy
[5:47:23] markja629: They haven't done anything the last 20 years. they won't do anything now
[5:47:24] twitch4home007: the game can’t handle this level of popularity @xaryu
[5:47:26] Tripxx1: more layoffs prob
[5:47:27] WhiteTowerGaming: add layers
[5:47:29] elfeeh: make it happen more often..
[5:47:30] Kuhkoenich: employ people who know what theyre doing
[5:47:34] lordextraordinary: the ppl cant qst xD
[5:47:35] PirateWizardKing: if im blizz im spending $0 on improving game and millions on suites
[5:47:37] prismo5: remove hunter pets
[5:47:37] OpticProwle: what is this? why are u constantly in pvp?
[5:47:39] Playonwordz: @Xaryu sorry xar 1 more time on the build
[5:47:40] syleion111: @iggiyoo you can farm blood on NPCs
[5:47:42] SavageSeb_: Just make it instanced
[5:47:43] KosmicDevil_: u also dont take damage
[5:47:47] lolzandis: WE NEED LIKE 3 ZONES NOT JUST 1
[5:47:50] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: drink breast milk
[5:47:51] buhtterstick: make it a BG
[5:47:53] alrajhio: ban more bots
[5:47:53] YouGotSquat: You are in a very full layer that is why it laggs
[5:47:53] x_praxy_x: perma delete account if you get killed in STV
[5:47:54] Uncle_Mitchy: MORE LAYOFFS
[5:47:57] largist_: nuking all npc would suck for questing opt puters
[5:48:00] MrFocuz: maybe multiple layers & separate layers for only stv
[5:48:01] Skyrian: i find it weird pets can attack even when the owner is paacified
[5:48:01] Nezzy243: send more copy paste to people putting in appeals
[5:48:02] kywozen: It being unplayable will self regulate, enough people get frustrated and stop playing = not laggy anymore
[5:48:07] lordextraordinary: make it 160 player BG instance
[5:48:08] VZLAV: @Uncle_Mitchy POGGERS
[5:48:08] iggiyoo: @syleion111 i know but i want to play lagfree instead farming npcs
[5:48:08] haileyxzx: spend more money are betters servers lol
[5:48:11] nemcoy: put out a bounty, 100k to whoever finds a solution
[5:48:13] KairuruTV: this is the problem with MEGA SERVERS
[5:48:15] n0dai: more layers = less players in your area, players will cry as usual
[5:48:18] espi: Lag will go away as SOD Phase 2 launch ends
[5:48:19] lemonarque: its almost like they dynamically spin up the event itself
[5:48:19] bbox16: 3:00 pm -> make new layers
[5:48:21] ShadowPriestFreshy: When will the Bloodmoon start?  .... I think I'm lagging.
[5:48:22] Dimpleshift: just put layer spinning up and down on a 3 hour timer with the event
[5:48:22] TadpoleBill: What if you queue to it?
[5:48:23] sinfulgamestv: the horde knew the kill squad was coming so lagging you out
[5:48:25] lemonarque: and should be able to do the same for layers
[5:48:25] enqubas: Simple fix: have NPCs around the zone that will pop up.  You queue solo and join a group of randoms OR join as a party.  Then you join a STV battleground full of no mobs and it's group vs group.
[5:48:27] asourdoughbaker: instanced events where you que in?
[5:48:29] Abuskillz: some thing would pop for you to enter the event and it would switch you your layer
[5:48:31] espi: More layers just means less rewards
[5:48:32] Playonwordz: !build
[5:48:32] StreamElements: Xaryu's gear & talents -> https://era.raider.io/characters/us/crusader-strike/Xaryu
[5:48:33] lolzandis: cramming it into 1 zone is the issue its too many players... have it be like 3 seperate zones
[5:48:36] haileyxzx: make it a instanced bg
[5:48:38] blazzedzz: Ask ashes of creation where they bought there servers
[5:48:40] Vilend34: Xar, whats your thoughts on rogues in p2 since fighting them?
[5:48:42] Aidu_Eynul: blow the dust off from the server cartridge
[5:48:44] denbleke: I have to say, I think the stv pvp event is a biiiit too much "alive" at the moment ^^
[5:48:56] bruuuhgoalready: KEKW
[5:49:07] shadowmouse516: switch to fire and enjoy combust and hot streak!  it’s so good
[5:49:07] geno_boost91: you should have to queue into the blood moon event, like the wintergrasp battle
[5:49:07] bruuuhgoalready: the ele shaman
[5:49:11] markja629: lol
[5:49:12] Sammah0: it's fun when it's working

[5:49:37] asloff: so scuffed XD
[5:49:45] ripintides: gross the shadowstep is like the tbc one and works in roots..?
[5:49:54] dalvasorsali: they might fix it next maintenance window, probably scaling up requires dowtime, or maybe not enough employees left who give a crap
[5:49:54] john_boxcars: turn the servers off then turn them back on
[5:49:55] haileyxzx: blizzard and their alibaba servers
[5:49:58] kiirkey: you lost blod
[5:49:58] strakatak: skip this one?
[5:49:59] xNotorietyx: nobody has killed yet
[5:50:19] johnnoski: you get more blood fighting around the boss
[5:50:21] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: gotta make a raid to kill it
[5:50:21] blazzedzz: Blow hot air from your mouth on the server and wipe it off with your dirty shirt
[5:50:21] S3yfu: heard u get more blood fighting near the boss. dunno if true
[5:50:25] lukemeleney: the closer you are too him the more blood you get
[5:50:26] detourz28: You get more blood around it. He has like 3mil hp
[5:50:29] Kriehp: its not killable, but you get more blood fighting around it
[5:50:30] Playonwordz: @Xaryu is winters chill worth specing into?
[5:50:30] largist_: you get extra blood from kills near boss
[5:50:33] n0dai: when a layer il nearly full, instead of moving 1 or 2 members of the grp from the layer, they needs to move the entire groups, so ppl will not spam reinvite their grp friends and bugged the layer
[5:50:38] nahvi_: yo just ordered some more elwood tees, got some a few months ago and love em
[5:50:39] juice42069: bruh i be geting SWD for like 1200
[5:50:40] john_boxcars: @blazzedzz this helps the server build character
[5:50:42] tuna_sandw1ch: @haileyxzx alibabas servers handle like 1.3 billion ppl
[5:50:42] BeeMcG: Do people boost SM yet
[5:50:45] lukemeleney: how does 3M hp compare to the doctor raid?
[5:50:47] thenightking06: Hey Xar ;)
[5:50:49] ayechillbro: my swd gets 1500 crits and I have no raid gear xD
[5:50:51] skimansr: Time to end stream @Xaryu , Go get ready for date night!
[5:50:58] Burlane: the boss has 3.2mil hp KEKW
[5:51:02] rxr407: it supposedly has 3 mil hp
[5:51:08] M0rley_: I dont think its killable
[5:51:13] M0rley_: it 1 shots anything it touches

[5:53:04] carlswaganonem: what do you get from the pvp event?
[5:53:05] killanthropist_: i dont know, frost cooldowns are long too and you can still arcane blast/missile barrage/heal while your one shot is reloading
[5:53:20] celestius11: @society1121 you max level already tho?
[5:53:28] M3imar: what mount y take from bloods mate?

[5:57:40] trmonx: you just wait a month people will stop when they get rewards
[5:57:40] MagicalPurs3: Because if you really think of it, lag is good because that means there are more individual users that are on your system. Means more money for the business.
[5:57:40] Badbotqt: stop making the event fun so no one comes
[5:57:40] plumpus81: on-prem cloud
[5:57:42] RewideLive: battle royal server jonk them
[5:57:46] Gaagaj: @Xaryu what gear you pref for pvp ? full stamina and spell power ?
[5:57:46] bigwilly3737: this is 90% of peoples experience rn in this event its terrible
[5:57:46] celestius11: less people per layer
[5:57:47] Speyto: invest more resources into servers
[5:57:47] neimac2: turn it into a qued bg
[5:57:48] sauceboifredo: the star forge ain’t holding up huh @xaryu
[5:57:49] unreliable6969: port players to a 80 player max layer
[5:57:51] ogstreamerlive: xayru chatt is sarcastic as xaryu
[5:57:59] Hissi: As a Certified Forklift Operator, i advise more layoffs to fix the issue
[5:58:02] Teokin: I think the way you move forward is you have more turn in spots or more places where PVP can happen. It's ultra concentrated right now and that's the problem it's not the number of players in the zone
[5:58:09] YEPznWxBKw94PpU: not fun if you're ganking people just out in the world
[5:58:09] nonsens27: @Xaryu I mean that the event takes place in 2 zones at once
[5:58:09] espi: they meant different world zones surely
[5:58:11] FeelsBadWoman: i wish it automaticly ressed you, like everyone gonna res anyways it is just mindless clicks
[5:58:14] blazzedzz: This reminds me of the Southpark special "critters Christmas" if anyone knows what I'm talking about LUL LUL
[5:58:14] Slaughter13x: just ditch Shannon and tonight and play WoW with the boys @xaryu
[5:58:26] Panic_Robot: Maybe the event completly wrong :) That's why they can't fix it :)
[5:58:29] petedelete2019: Whats your thouughts on this event? @Xaryu
[5:58:30] sauceboifredo: maybe you just need a new pc?
[5:58:31] Gaagaj: what gear you pref for pvp ? full stamina and spell power ?
[5:58:36] l337I: where's mitch jones
[5:58:41] shibbz0r: What's this event
[5:58:46] Reaperz_kinetic: holy lag fest
[5:58:47] fenocian: this event has private server vibes
[5:58:49] McCurtis: just make it like helltides in diablo
[5:58:53] yungcheesespread: @FeelsBadWoman disagree, you can now choose if you wanna rez at a different point
[5:58:55] thewal1ofsleep: bloods?
[5:58:58] trickypork: do you get honor during this event?
[5:58:59] nonsens27: @Xaryu Let the event take place in stv and duskwood at the same time. People pvp in 2 zones
[5:59:04] Slaughter13x: just ditch Shannon tonight and play WoW with the boys @xaryu
[5:59:10] bigwilly3737: i mean who thought this event was gonna be smooth with no lag? its blizzard
[5:59:24] yowler_: you dont get honor
[5:59:28] ElephantSurfer: you dont get honor
[5:59:30] Django_7: no you dont get honor @Xaryu
[5:59:31] Pwinzor: you dont get honor or hks during event
[5:59:33] thewal1ofsleep: can you be any level and do this?
[5:59:33] xfrostlus: no honor
[5:59:34] feebeater: can you get the rep with AB now?
[5:59:35] unreliable6969: where do u turn in for honor?
[5:59:36] Gaagaj: @Xaryu  what gear you pref for pvp ? full stamina and spell power ?
[5:59:38] juice42069: is this diff server or u not 40 yet?
[5:59:39] syleion111: @nonsens27 why duskwood ? nobody from horde would go there :D
[5:59:39] Barleycorned: there should be more rewards to buy
[5:59:47] Barleycorned: im already doen after 2 events
[5:59:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @bigwilly3737 it wasn’t smooth at the start and there were a few events between patches where there was no lag… but it seems with each patch to “fix” things they bring back lag
[5:59:52] espi: @Barleycorned bruh
[5:59:54] Wyant69: @Xaryu You still on track for gnomer on friday??
[5:59:59] garbagekidttv: u think they leave melee hunter untouched ? @Xaryu
[6:00:02] unreliable6969: @Barleycorned the mount i guess
[6:00:03] YuraruY: @Barleycorned oh show the mount
[6:00:04] Reaperz_kinetic: @bigwilly3737 it WAS smooth at the start my bad
[6:00:04] Yamamoto78: the lag will die down when everyone gets there epics and opt out
[6:00:05] SilentWisco: @thewal1ofsleep I prolly would wait till at least 35+ bc of the zone mobs
[6:00:05] blomsteryo: FOR THE GNOMES! For Gnomeregan!!!!
[6:00:07] nonsens27: @syleion111 Because its next to stv so the areas are connected
[6:00:12] McCurtis: that lag is crazy
[6:00:13] Slaughter13x: just ditch Shannon tonight and play WoW with the boys @xaryu
[6:00:28] rchrdk: nice copium
[6:00:31] Barleycorned: not counting the mount - a ring and a cloak, 7 silver, done
[6:00:31] hersheyjh: Grind SM
[6:00:32] Teokin: honestly it would be best if they had blood turn ins after the event instead of during, that would make the entire zone a just pvp frenzy with no hotspots that cause the lag
[6:00:34] metalfingers07: this event is cool in theory but in reality blows
[6:00:35] syleion111: @nonsens27 still , nobody would go there from horde, cuz we dont have flying point or zeppelin or boat there, only ally
[6:00:36] Wyant69: @Xaryu Friday would be so lit broooo
[6:00:38] chasingshadowsz: why not 40 tho??
[6:00:38] unreliable6969: the speed buff on rez is so nice, being a pala with a spell mount sucked
[6:00:39] lukemeleney: man look at how busy it is out there
[6:00:40] Zacrilioth: i dont think its possible to do gnomer HC w/o getting pre-bis
[6:00:41] Joelucianttv: I'll take for you
[6:00:41] MilfanCookiez: did u burn thru all your sleeping bag candy already?
[6:00:42] tuskraiderwow: just ditch Shannon tonight and play WoW with the boys @Xaryu
[6:00:44] Barleycorned: need something else too, doesnt need to be gear
[6:00:47] Joelucianttv: Tank
[6:00:49] Zacrilioth: i dont think its possible to do gnomer HC w/o getting pre-bis...
[6:00:51] bigwilly3737: do you ever have eye issues sitting in front of the computer so much?
[6:00:53] nemcoy: Do u have 9 ppl to boost your unprepared ass tho? :)
[6:00:58] yigitaytac3: why we cant blick when stunn dont get it
[6:01:00] Zacrilioth: gnomer hardcore
[6:01:01] tevona: @Xaryu is there a reason to turn in blood for copper before the 30 mins pass?
[6:01:04] Joelucianttv: Full prebis tank paladin
[6:01:15] garbagekidttv: do are your thought on melee hunter ? do they leave them as is? @Xaryu
[6:01:18] Zacrilioth: i meant to do hardcore gnomer without prebis
[6:01:18] trickjames2: ppl did gnomer straight after hitting 40. i think itll be fine :p
[6:01:19] Syloa: gnomer is super easy with full bfd gear
[6:01:21] ninpoon: @XARYU what do you think of the Ascension mode?
[6:01:22] artorias_tv: That shadow Word death hits hard
[6:01:26] smoore48: did gnomer saturday on rogue and only upgrades from my bfd gear were WSG rep dagger/neck/ring. it's not that bad
[6:01:31] ghanoben_6191: how does this event working ?
[6:01:36] unreliable6969: ye shadow priest are crazy
[6:01:43] Playonwordz: pretty sure those fodders are full hp/mana pots
[6:01:45] thewal1ofsleep: can you still do the regular 5 man version of BFD and gnomer in SOD, or just the raids
[6:01:46] Nicholas909: eh
[6:01:48] lordextraordinary: it is
[6:01:53] bigwilly3737: hardcore gnomer is gonna be a wipe for sure
[6:02:03] Slaughter13x: ditch Shannon and play WoW with the boys tonight @xaryu
[6:02:10] nonsens27: @syleion111 if you can get to stv you can get to duskwood i think it would work.
[6:02:14] garbagekidttv: What are your thoughts on melee hunter? @Xaryu im editing a clip for savixx
[6:02:17] SilentWisco: There are plenty of upgrades
[6:02:20] succaw: not really , pearl you will keep and hat and boots and weaps everything else i replaced on my mage
[6:02:20] ogSaltdaddy: @Xaryu We did gnomer yesterday and got 2 epic drops on our first clear :D
[6:02:20] tevona: @Xaryu is there a reason to turn in blood for copper before the 30 mins pass? 󠀀
[6:02:26] juice42069: is that new? i did the 5 man last phase
[6:02:26] neomonstr: @ghanoben_6191 You get "Coins" for each killing blow you do, the coins can be traded in for gear & mounts :) grouping is encouraged, being in a raidgrp gets you punished, solo is terrible
[6:02:36] ElephantSurfer: yeah man it really sucks for that one guy that loved fucking bfd
[6:02:37] NosfeRAtu0202: wbt a mythic 5man bfd
[6:02:43] ogSaltdaddy: for group, I didnt get either of them :D
[6:02:45] XialdinSR: The only upgrades my group had and completed gnomer was the STV rewards and i had the epic bracers from wsg exhalted
[6:02:48] alpacabowldood: gnomer is more about being attentive to mechanics than it is about gear. Xaryu and competent wow players could do it in greens if they have a solid tank
[6:02:50] Ronin825: am i the only one who's getting insane lag and layering issues in STV pvp ?
[6:02:58] bronchoped1: Yeah nice seeing the epics. Seems like it's possible for every boss to drop a epic
[6:03:00] unreliable6969: @neomonstr i think they changed it to team killing blows now
[6:03:09] syleion111: @nonsens27 you are still missing the point, if ppl cant get there directly, nobody would waste their time, of swimming or travelling there, specially when the road  is next to ally camps
[6:03:10] breakfastbygate: of xarmoo dies, Will you never Play it anymore?
[6:03:14] nonsens27: @syleion111 also gromgol is pretty far north not optimal but still. Also maybe ad a flightpass but i dont think blizzard would
[6:03:17] mrwaddles22: how many coins u got now
[6:03:18] neomonstr: @unreliable6969 Can confirm, that's correct :) Was just trying to list some shit fast
[6:04:06] SilentWisco: @nonsens27 if your ally run from sent
[6:04:07] emshot_: r u going for the mount?
[6:04:08] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[6:04:11] garbagekidttv: can u please give ur thoughts on mellee hunter? do they leave hunter untouched this phase? making a video rn and it would help to hear @Xaryu
[6:04:18] iFusion5194: the shadow on your shirt makes it look like youre sweating profusely
[6:04:21] fernandorbretas: nice lag
[6:04:37] Slaughter13x: thoughts on fire warlock? @xaryu
[6:04:40] garbagekidttv: ty
[6:04:44] 1cyveins: it does duckKekw
[6:04:52] metalfingers07: this event is actually so unfun
[6:04:56] MagicalPurs3: You should listen to "The Mexican OT"
[6:04:59] tuna_sandw1ch: wait cannot you not rank up with a dishonorable kill?
[6:05:03] jkuup: @Xaryu can you ask your blizzard connections, if they are aware of the eclipse rune not working properly? Pushback protection doesn't work
[6:05:07] 1cyveins: @tuna_sandw1ch nope
[6:05:11] fofito369: did u know the golden cat mount is based on a 2008 WoW myth? @Xaryu
[6:05:42] tuna_sandw1ch: @1cyveins damnnnn..I had Marshall in 2005 but never got a DK
[6:05:47] limburgse: this lag doesnt look fun at all, like watching pinball
[6:05:56] NosfeRAtu0202: Amrs or Fury warrior for pve?
[6:06:03] nonsens27: @syleion111 I agree that its not optimal but besides adding more layers I dont think there is a great solution. I dont want to split it up from 2 totally disconnected zones
[6:06:18] Speyto: shh dont tell anyone
[6:06:19] bbox16: If you kick you get kicked in all schools
[6:06:25] enqubas: what needs a nerf?
[6:06:29] bronchoped1: Spriest healing seems worse
[6:06:31] petethemyth: does the healing really matter when its just one shots anyways
[6:06:33] mistahfrank: bro get silenced in that heal and you cant do shit
[6:06:37] Slaughter13x: WoW is the greatest game of all time
[6:06:46] nonsens27: Are there any alters on the southern pirate area?
[6:07:06] tuskraiderwow: @Slaughter13x right up there with Monopoly
[6:07:10] juice42069: its the greatest game when u are hitting 20 mobs with ravager
[6:07:14] r4men_noodle: As somone who started wow like 9 months ago, it is BIS
[6:07:17] Slaughter13x: @tuskraiderwow lmao!!!
[6:07:21] griffinwish: what is the 2nd best game of all time?
[6:07:27] Udenwo: good, maybe it will stop groups then
[6:07:30] ElephantSurfer: group up 10 minutes before the event LuL
[6:07:34] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: feels like they listened to you this morning, but it's not working this afternoon
[6:07:36] n0dai: ask em to invite you in a more stable layer
[6:07:37] adeeoe: have to group and meet up earlier
[6:07:41] society1121: lol they aint gonna solve nothing
[6:07:41] Barleycorned: the people in the full layer should be going to the party member in the lower layer
[6:07:41] LemenTozen: just move the whole party to the low pop layer
[6:07:42] TheoDeri: paying money for better servers could be a solution
[6:07:44] 1cyveins: duckWeird
[6:07:44] KairuruTV: easy, make server with normal populations
[6:07:44] thesirganks: just force all the people in a grp into the same layer
[6:07:48] enqubas: they should've just made stv event into a battleground that you queue up solo or as a group
[6:07:48] 1_total_jabroni: the key to a good pastry is lots of layers
[6:07:49] moocowthecow: Easy, layer groups into new layers first. And don't do it when capped, do it at like 70% cap prio
[6:07:49] rustyjeep: people working at Blizzard, you mean like...both of them?
[6:07:49] twitchwarfoo: @xaryu More layers but don't cap?
[6:07:51] neomonstr: @nonsens27 nah, the most southern one is at the ruins on the eastern beach filled with undead :p
[6:08:04] tevona: @xaryu make it instanced like av?
[6:08:09] mistahfrank: make so you can decide your own layer
[6:08:17] Unusual_Steeze: I heard it was only happening to people with starforge systems
[6:08:18] adam_brisbane: make everyone play solo for the event one time see if the lag happens
[6:08:18] DailyDave: If u in a group your on the same layer if the layer is full and you have half a group in that layer. Your full group gets send to the next layer
[6:08:30] tuna_sandw1ch: @TheoDeri ppl act like "just buying new servers" is a viable option..you know nothing behind run, usage, wattage, ppl, costs, installs etc
[6:08:31] AndskiMusic: thanks Xar it was fun anyway - from Napenjoyer
[6:08:38] skimansr: yeah its the opposite of world pvp
[6:08:40] carlswaganonem: how many coins you at?
[6:08:40] P_h_l_o_x: what happens when you’re in a raid group
[6:08:42] ElephantSurfer: no
[6:08:44] KairuruTV: no
[6:08:44] AgentIce99: yes
[6:08:45] adeeoe: nope
[6:08:45] espi: no lol
[6:08:45] 1cyveins: no
[6:08:46] tacoking011: no
[6:08:47] dutchie559: no
[6:08:47] capnzac: time-gated event based pvp does little to encourage 'world pvp', it's effectively a battleground anyway
[6:08:48] Mckenziehehe: no
[6:08:48] Zuldandi: no
[6:08:50] DBGmal: Yes just during the bloodmoon
[6:08:50] killthedemon12: no
[6:08:51] capisun523: Not instance but layering
[6:08:52] myahkaho: no
[6:08:53] aekovontwitch: Why doesn't anyone do Uldaman, can I get an answer chat? SeemsGood
[6:08:53] Walgui1: nope, they did fix Ashenval
[6:08:54] OinkNico: no
[6:08:56] nonsens27: We want involentary pvp
[6:08:56] markusgg_: it could be like tol barad? @Xaryu
[6:08:57] P_h_l_o_x: no
[6:08:59] AgentIce99: its the only way they can remove the lag
[6:09:01] Phlanxx: no instance, they ruined wrath wintergrasp by making it instanced
[6:09:06] Smidz_: @aekovontwitch I'm in uldaman now :P
[6:09:10] Grooveii: they have to fix lag though, unplayable
[6:09:12] skimansr: instance is the opposite of world pvp
[6:09:12] OinkNico: Temp layers a possibility?
[6:09:12] AgentIce99: believe it or not, layers are basically instances too. we need the instances to be smaller
[6:09:13] BigBabaOne77: this event make no sense in a instance
[6:09:20] Paayne_Music: Make more layers and make it so you can select and swap your own layer during the event
[6:09:22] Slaughter13x: some dude said it was only people with Starforge systems 😂
[6:09:22] foam52: neither do they
[6:09:25] AgentIce99: there are too many players "per instance"
[6:09:27] Playonwordz: @Xaryu was ashenvale this bad the first couple of times?
[6:09:29] imseekz: they shoulda make it 2-3 zones instead of all at stv
[6:09:31] killthedemon12: yes
[6:09:31] carlswaganonem: what is your coin count now after the event?
[6:09:31] aekovontwitch: Stream Uldaman
[6:09:33] chobinhood_: tbh it'll probably work itself out in a week
[6:09:37] XialdinSR: I want it to be an actual FFA no groups allowed, im sick of brig groups just stting 20 seconds away from a GY and killing anyone that comes off cd
[6:09:40] zarod89: feels like layers just weaker than the servers we used to have
[6:09:43] sincerityirl: just have permanent blood moon so it isnt as intensive
[6:09:43] strakatak: can you still turn in tyhat blood?
[6:09:44] TrAllesOe: How many coins u got?
[6:09:50] POOFMORE: it will
[6:09:51] OinkNico: TRU
[6:09:52] 1cyveins: duckKekw
[6:09:53] P_h_l_o_x: those scrubs need better hardware
[6:10:05] Temrye: Xaryu I fought you like ten times and Shit is toxic because of the lag, Just could not track you as Melee at all, had you at 15% Hp a couple times
[6:10:08] nb_lee: true
[6:10:08] tevona: @AgentIce99 not exactly, u cant invite your friend to the same bg with u if he isnt there at the beggining
[6:10:08] JeebieTheSwampSage: on a stack?
[6:10:09] Speyto: dead in a couple weeks YEP
[6:10:10] Slaughter13x: OGs only. bandwagoners will dip
[6:10:11] ii_poncho_via_ii: yup cant wait for the quitters
[6:10:12] capnzac: honestly it just feels like a battleground to me with more lag
[6:10:15] Hanscakestealer: no cap babay
[6:10:16] wamuu1: that's what blizz is counting on
[6:10:18] DaProfit: but more people will quit if its bad now
[6:10:19] hazuki_15: all the warriors gonna quit
[6:10:20] ripintides: or more people will be 40 and want to do the event
[6:10:22] wwombology: shit classic players are for sure gonna quit when they fail at gnomer
[6:10:23] shloom995: check gurabashi arena
[6:10:26] lordextraordinary: but coming weeks will be worse, because now more will reach 40
[6:10:27] Daddycool_B: Exactly what happened in ashenvale phase 1
[6:10:28] capnzac: just happens to be 'in the world' but i could easily imagine being in wsg 'in the world'
[6:10:32] garbagekidttv: why dont u do amazon giveways? mitch is kinda fuckn me over rn im starving and need food. could really use that 100 amazon card
[6:10:35] tuna_sandw1ch: compression and scaling
[6:10:38] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[6:10:39] adeeoe: yea all the people that are running out of things to do because they leveled to 40 in 2 minutes
[6:10:42] ElephantSurfer: its awful as melee, the desync just makes everyone teleport and you cant follow anyone
[6:10:47] sauceboifredo: it’s the starforge computers man
[6:10:52] sauceboifredo: them shits janky
[6:10:53] Slaughter13x: once the bottom feeders weed out we will be aight Xar
[6:10:55] enqubas: easy fix: have a lower soft cap for population.  you can get over that cap for that layer if a group member joins.
[6:11:01] Temrye: Yea it just feels bad man, gg on the fights though @Xaryu
[6:11:02] BSVMV: it sucks cause you say more layers right but were having major layer issues already with my grps not getting on same layer
[6:11:02] Final_Griever: Whats the penalty for dying during event?
[6:11:14] blazzedzz: I for saw this and decided against rolling on crusader strike lol
[6:11:15] sauceboifredo: orrrrr
[6:11:19] sauceboifredo: buy a new pc?
[6:11:23] enqubas: yes
[6:11:28] DailyDave: That would mean you need a lot more layers
[6:11:29] largist_: how many bloodcoins you have gathered
[6:11:31] espi: they did for Ashenvale, ppl used it to STACK layers by inviting
[6:11:34] Phlanxx: @sauceboifredo its server lag not pc lag, wtf you mean
[6:11:40] swifty1116: How many coins??????
[6:11:44] CyjaxOG: just need a queue into layer option yeah
[6:11:44] husky907: maybe even breaking it by lvl...let 25-39's have their own stv event, 40's are put on their own zone
[6:11:54] sauceboifredo: my shit run smooth @phlanxx
[6:11:57] Paayne_Music: yeah during the event
[6:12:01] sauceboifredo: I got a computer for vanilla
[6:12:02] Paayne_Music: or only in STV
[6:12:02] WcWillow: man layering is terrible, our whole group was fighting together in stv and we all got layered into different layers
[6:12:07] Detrect: layers are so buggy atm, my group kept getting seperated across different layers durring the event
[6:12:07] wiedehopf: Don't think there is a 10 layer limit, it's just the addon tracking it is limited to 10 layers.
[6:12:08] x_jdot: maybe just restrict it to STV somehow
[6:12:08] Phlanxx: @sauceboifredo happens when you're on a dead server
[6:12:08] cthreeplo: i wish it was horde vs alliance
[6:12:13] WcWillow: during the event at least
[6:12:13] enqubas: but allow group members to join that layer
[6:12:14] Slaughter13x: once the bottom feeders are logged out in a week or two we will be good Xar
[6:12:20] jkuup: @Xaryu  only during the event?
[6:12:22] cthreeplo: why isnt it horde vs alliance
[6:12:24] kajjan112: They've had technology to phase zones forever.
[6:12:24] sauceboifredo: @phlanxx yeah living flame super empty lol
[6:12:26] nides_: can you just mega layer STV maybe?
[6:12:28] Final_Griever: @Xaryu What penalty is there for dying during event?
[6:12:29] espi: horde vs alliance never works
[6:12:31] SippinSimpSyrup: Why cant tou change the number of layers per zone
[6:12:31] HSLN: were there layers back in 2005 ?
[6:12:38] swifty1116: How many coins u got now xar
[6:12:38] sauceboifredo: I’m not a rp server like this crusader joke
[6:12:40] Paladez: make different channels like lost ark and u manually choose which channel to go maybe?
[6:12:40] twitchwarfoo: @xaryu AV specific layers maybe?
[6:12:41] ogSaltdaddy: @Xaryu Yeah, you have to have layers zonebound. So if a zone X has under Y amount of players set layers as 2, for example
[6:12:42] SLAMMMY: HC HYPE
[6:12:42] Spikeqc: pepeD
[6:12:43] nonsens27: @cthreeplo It would turn into a zergfest
[6:12:43] stefkko24: @cthreeplo cuz isnt balanced
[6:12:45] cthreeplo: AV is literally gonna be horde vs alliance
[6:12:45] Spikeqc: AngelThump
[6:12:46] DailyDave: Can they make zone specific layering?
[6:12:46] jkuup: @Final_Griever you lose a little blood thats it
[6:12:56] n0dai: layers are in charge of many zones, not only one. they could use specific layer dedicated to the event, so less charge in
[6:12:58] capnzac: i really thionk they could encourage consistent world pvp by having a set of valuable objectives for people to fight over consistently (eg., xp buff, gold buff, material spawns like mining) that encourage combat at all times, not just during events
[6:12:59] tuna_sandw1ch: its CPU power, based on network infra..you think these newer desktops use the same processing power?
[6:13:01] kajjan112: They already have this technology though.
[6:13:05] largist_: what is ur current count of bloodcoins
[6:13:08] x_jdot: nu tech
[6:13:12] TcrTV_: did u get the spell crit rune yet?  that might be good w/ icelance
[6:13:13] swifty1116: COIN CHECK
[6:13:14] invktvs: @Xaryu blizzard needs to purchase servers that support more players. Pretty simple solution just costs more $ which they probably dont want to spend. Layers is their cheap solution.
[6:13:15] kajjan112: This is what they use in retail?
[6:13:17] retgarr: They have that tech for Retail, it's just not what they did with Classic
[6:13:18] asourdoughbaker: what you're describing sounds no different to instancing to me
[6:13:25] sauceboifredo: ^
[6:13:28] Frank4LuLz: https://clips.twitch.tv/CrackyGleamingPizzaArsonNoSexy-d1CEQ2a4plfo4u6U
[6:13:32] 1cyveins: duckCreep
[6:13:33] sauceboifredo: layering is instancing imo
[6:13:33] Joeldftw: that’s sharding right?
[6:13:40] retgarr: that's the difference between Layering and Sharding
[6:13:41] SippinSimpSyrup: Layering should be dynamic by zone
[6:13:49] grebogef: quest reawrds
[6:13:54] 1cyveins: DO NOT duckRage
[6:13:54] ralphh1541: layer vs sharding
[6:13:55] wiedehopf: @invktvs hardware mostly is not the solution to software scaling issues.
[6:13:57] Ronin825: @Xaryu its a good idea, its just a big change in the engine, and long to implement
[6:13:59] m1lkman10: You risk the world feeling empty
[6:14:00] enqubas: if it's currently 10 layers with 2000 per layer.  your layer is at 1996.  if your group of 5 joins, 1 person gets moved to a layer.  My suggestion is have 20 layers  with a soft cap of 1500 and a hard cap of 2000.  If your group of 5 joints, the extra 500 spots allow the whole group join.
[6:14:00] alexandrub: it's already doing layers per zones, I'd rather have them layer based  on local density
[6:14:03] tuna_sandw1ch: @chat blizzard doesnt have a room for "just WoW servers"..chances are they are Cobol and DB2(all banks use)
[6:14:03] thewal1ofsleep: no
[6:14:03] kajjan112: Should only be used for extreme cases like this
[6:14:04] Joeldftw: i sharded
[6:14:04] ripintides: no real connectivity between zones?
[6:14:04] pretty_cool_guy: never shard
[6:14:04] taylorsdank: maybe the retail not feeling like an mmo thing
[6:14:06] Bolt_: who sharted?
[6:14:12] syleion111: @SippinSimpSyrup that would be probably difficult to implement
[6:14:17] TakiitoPotato: shart solutions
[6:14:17] rjmc94: sharting?????
[6:14:17] the_dayquill: I dont like it when i shart, it gets messy
[6:14:24] 1cyveins: @rjmc94 HUH
[6:14:30] Puskakana: Dont worry. SOD Will be dead in 2 - 3 weeks and problem has been solved :D
[6:14:30] Drukalnn: yes it does
[6:14:32] numblezzz: sharding feels worse
[6:14:32] KairuruTV: yeah
[6:14:33] callerino12345: huuh
[6:14:34] tilt_kongen: 171 / 5.000 Oversættelsesresultater Oversættelsen Hi Xaryu Thanks for always inspiring, I benched two plates last week and ran my first half marathon the same week. I find great inspiration in your lifestyle advice so thank you.
[6:14:36] BeeMcG: no
[6:14:37] einself111: no
[6:14:40] Baeroz: sharding is more aggressive
[6:14:42] bamfosaurus: thought it was the same tbh
[6:14:42] sauceboifredo: when I shard I gotta go wipe my arse
[6:14:43] einself111: sharding feels terrible
[6:14:43] provender_: sharting feels worse
[6:14:44] YermGames: sharting?
[6:14:46] Zhimso: layering is still same server thoi
[6:14:47] enqubas: sharting is bad, but sharding lol
[6:14:50] SippinSimpSyrup: Also layering barely works currently you can spend like 30 mins in a grp and not layer
[6:14:51] hclark0: What is sharding? sry im boomer
[6:14:51] morat_g: Sharing feels worse
[6:14:51] Bolt_: You couldn't bring people over
[6:14:54] skimansr: cause it runs dowm your leg
[6:14:54] callerino12345: huh
[6:14:54] blazzedzz: The servers are already sharting them selves LUL
[6:14:56] lordsloths: @Puskakana lol no
[6:14:58] TakiitoPotato: cuz then thers shit in your pants?
[6:14:58] Suqz: sharting is like my worst fear
[6:14:58] johnnyzampano: sharting feels bad because you get poop down your leg, layering underware is nice because it keeps the poop in them and not down your leg
[6:14:59] Bolt_: Layers lets you go through boundaries
[6:15:04] Bolt_: no
[6:15:04] taylorsdank: guys LMAO
[6:15:05] SilentWisco: I like how Gw2 Zones work.
[6:15:05] BoyeTV: Increasing the global cooldown on abilitys to 2 seconds will fix it
[6:15:06] BeeMcG: no 󠀀
[6:15:07] Bolt_: sharding is a different server
[6:15:08] nonsens27: Xaryu do you think they should do 1 bloodmoon a day where you cant group total free for all
[6:15:09] cvkarrosh: Layering keeps you warm, sharting makes you sad.
[6:15:09] 1cyveins: duckRage
[6:15:09] TransMutedMaya: sharting?
[6:15:10] Spikeqc: sharting
[6:15:11] Unusual_Steeze: lol
[6:15:12] Keyboundgaming: @xaryu can I get a Valentine’s Day “For gnomeregan!” ???
[6:15:13] taylorsdank: LOOOL
[6:15:13] Zacrilioth: sharting?
[6:15:16] shadowstar2080: isnt sharding when u poop ur pants?
[6:15:17] Travmo4: idk man Im getting sick of fighting over quest tags though
[6:15:18] largist_: it feels worse because new things are scary
[6:15:19] neomonstr: I genuinely think it'd be better if they just instanced it :p make it like a BG that you enter by simply talking to a specific NPC in the zone, and make it like a cap of X amount of players per instance... They did AV with 80 people in 2005, surely they can do 500+ in 2024
[6:15:20] buhtterstick: I sharted on my run on monday- wasn't fun.
[6:15:21] taylorsdank: i'll literally NEVER forget my first shart
[6:15:25] 808polska: @Keyboundgaming +1
[6:15:26] bxmang: sharting catches you by surprise so it sucks
[6:15:27] asloff: xarPain
[6:15:27] YermGames: i sharted once, it was not fun.
[6:15:29] pretty_cool_guy: OMEGALUL
[6:15:30] notchacebb: W STREAMER
[6:15:32] Badbotqt: please define sharting
[6:15:32] obstata: @shadowstar2080 accidentally
[6:15:32] enqubas: jesus!  what is with that giant water container?
[6:15:33] tuna_sandw1ch: who was that 1 streamer who shit himself on stream and got perma banned?
[6:15:35] invktvs: @wiedehopf or they could redesign the backend to treat each zone as a server rather than layers within servers. there’s a million ways to solve it they just don’t want to spend the $
[6:15:35] 1cyveins: duckWeird
[6:15:37] Spikeqc: how would blizzard sharts have any impact on performance
[6:15:39] SippinSimpSyrup: Sharting def doesnt feel great
[6:15:40] kanaplayzz: whaddup xar
[6:15:42] taylorsdank: @enqubas LMAO this made me cackle
[6:15:42] swifty1116: BLOOD COIN CHECK
[6:15:43] Bolt_: @Xaryu Multiplayer gamedev for 15+ years. Some of chat is right, others are complete idiots who think their JS knowledge translates to expertise
[6:15:46] Archie_Bunker: Shart question - Can you shart so much that you've pooped yourself or is it still a shart?
[6:15:47] jembah3: my ur a bald one
[6:15:48] Keyboundgaming: xarGIGASHAN
[6:15:48] Slaughter13x: Ditch your date night and play WoW with the boys @xaryu

[6:15:58] einself111: @largist_ sharding is older than layering lol
[6:15:58] tommygunz31: how long is alliance going to be locked for
[6:16:00] Keyboundgaming: xarTroll he said the thing
[6:16:00] taylorsdank: @Slaughter13x dude its his WIFE
[6:16:01] WojoFog: @Xaryu  Why do You think you have more viewers than Payo?
[6:16:09] skimansr: Shartyu
[6:16:10] espi: Nervous for the date?
[6:16:14] grebogef: solo joining for the event ? or 5 player group ?
[6:16:14] jahslim: It's not locked
[6:16:17] spy_bones: its because of layers
[6:16:17] SippinSimpSyrup: Just make layering actually work
[6:16:18] taylorsdank: @WojoFog its the hair
[6:16:20] neimac2: make a horde del;ete it and you can make allaince
[6:16:20] kanaplayzz: prob will change shortly
[6:16:22] society1121: @Xaryu if you stand up and do the gnome dance right at this very moment, i will send an anonymous donation of $100,000
[6:16:22] cheddarluca: horde just has the better players
[6:16:24] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Layering is just 1 server. Sharding is serveral servers and smaller area.
[6:16:25] Spikeqc: Kapp
[6:16:26] minimusmax_: it unlocks and relocks often just keep trying
[6:16:28] itsmistero: lmao
[6:16:29] MilfanCookiez: were able to make horde and ally on the same sever now?
[6:16:32] sauceboifredo: he’s nervous
[6:16:33] thesirganks: lets hope she likes you
[6:16:35] swifty1116: Blood coin check?
[6:16:37] itsmistero: def nervoous
[6:16:42] SippinSimpSyrup: Spent 20 minutes on grp and layered to different layers then my grp
[6:16:48] blazzedzz: Crusader Shart LUL LUL
[6:16:53] largist_: blood coin check
[6:17:00] itsmistero: @Xaryu its okay bruh i have a feeling she like you
[6:17:00] tuna_sandw1ch: you getting steak fajitas, con jalapenos? @Xaryu
[6:17:08] KairuruTV: how about not having servers with 55,000 players when they werent inteded for it?
[6:17:09] sauceboifredo: we just combine shart
[6:17:11] iRayG2: how do they fix it?
[6:17:13] Slaughter13x: @taylorsdank I’m aware. he’s nicer than me, ima be on WoW
[6:17:14] enqubas: have a phased layer for stv
[6:17:14] sauceboifredo: problem solbed
[6:17:15] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: honestly, just maek the layers during the event, who cares if the world feels a little more dead for 30 minutes
[6:17:17] Zolshy89: LET HIM COOK
[6:17:17] peardraxz: STV layers
[6:17:21] Spikeqc: more sharts?
[6:17:21] BSVMV: @Xaryu what is sharding?
[6:17:27] Festwoche: so just stv layer for now?
[6:17:30] enqubas: just needs a phased layer for stv tbh
[6:17:32] Norbicu: Isnt that a bg?
[6:17:32] juice42069: just make it an STV a massive instance
[6:17:34] JosieFS: or just make STV have more layers and keep the rest the same
[6:17:35] SippinSimpSyrup: Make sharting great again
[6:17:36] moocowthecow: Zone specific layers is sharing and it's easy to exploit
[6:17:39] asourdoughbaker: xar, how is layering for one specific zone differnt then making it an instanced deal?
[6:17:39] peardraxz: Azmon Layer
[6:17:41] madabber_: oh yeah so heavily camped spots can be more camped
[6:17:42] enqubas: yes
[6:17:46] sauceboifredo: facts
[6:17:47] LonesmokerTV: ISNT IT ALREADY LIKE THAT?
[6:17:48] YermGames: better
[6:17:49] moocowthecow: Sharding * ac
[6:17:50] invktvs: right. just simply treat each zone as a server rather than layers within a server and link each zone to larger servers that support more players. it’s really not that hard to solve just costs $
[6:17:50] LonesmokerTV: oops caps
[6:17:51] SpaceCowboy0811: Is there proof that's how it works?
[6:17:51] wevlin: xaryu 1 asmon 2
[6:17:51] sauceboifredo: make sharing great again
[6:17:53] Spikeqc: sharting -> wet lands
[6:17:54] holrem: You're using sense though
[6:17:56] jamesQodex: Fire mages are pumping in gnomer
[6:17:56] sauceboifredo: sharting
[6:18:01] Badbotqt: then you end up on the last created STV layer and there’s 7 people
[6:18:03] TboneSoFlo: adaptive layering would be quality
[6:18:03] twitchwarfoo: @xaryu Have it be lowered only during the 30 minute event time? Then go back to 2000 per layer?
[6:18:09] Mr_NeonCloud: I feel like that would be hard as nothing is instanced..
[6:18:10] enqubas: it would work, but i dont think blizzard is capable of doing that in a timely manner
[6:18:11] botttpounder: xaryu will u be my valentine?
[6:18:13] Mr_NeonCloud: Maybe im wrong
[6:18:13] iRayG2: sounds good SeemsGood
[6:18:13] Slaughter13x: everyone just love WoW & your PC and we will be fine
[6:18:13] n0dai: yep, layering for whole world, excepted for the event zone, using shards in it
[6:18:14] ogSaltdaddy: @Xaryu as it is with all tech p much
[6:18:14] twitchwarfoo: That way it only feels dead for 30 minutes
[6:18:15] boglehc: Thats Sharding, its a thing
[6:18:16] swifty1116: Rare mob farming
[6:18:17] ChillyHTX: or make stv a Que like Wintergrasp with a max # of players @xaryu
[6:18:19] sauceboifredo: sharting is how we made wet lands
[6:18:21] buhtterstick: would that cause inflation due to the increased availability of mining nodes/herbs
[6:18:23] neomonstr: They could just instance the event :) like a much larger scaled AV :D
[6:18:23] sauceboifredo: that’s facts
[6:18:25] Bolt_: @xaryu Yeah, but do you even SQL bro?
[6:18:27] HighGradeStacks: what is that add on that shows the arrows to entrances and exits on the map?
[6:18:30] fofito369: @Xaryu if you had to create a new WoW class, what would you create?
[6:18:30] lordsloths: @Badbotqt this
[6:18:31] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: i'm cool with there being 30 minutes where i get more mining nodes
[6:18:43] m1lkman10: I majored in accounting
[6:18:44] blazzedzz: Could they make a bloodmoon "fog" that lowers render distence?

[6:18:54] Travmo4: @Badbotqt bro when youre trying to quest and mob spawns take a long time the less people the better. Questing can take 10x longer when there are  a lot of people in a zone, STV especially
[6:18:54] terrapinstation: druids would be cool

[6:20:16] dtheis1: hey xaryu, looked into arcane mage for pvp `? that  shit is heavy
[6:20:18] jogabonico93: No deepfreez?
[6:20:21] tuna_sandw1ch: MIS is tech with biz focused, CS is nerd/just software/languages etc
[6:20:21] fishh1017: how come?
[6:20:21] flipmeister: your degree gave you a certain perspective on the world and knowledge that you've added to your toolbox, so it's been handy
[6:20:26] restless_prince: for anyone going to college, enjoy it tho ;) but choose the cheapest option for yourself
[6:20:31] Jggrnght: What degree do you have
[6:20:31] nonsens27: Arcane pvp could be sick

[6:20:36] hairfair88: Warden from LOTRO is probably the most unique class in any MMO I've played...but it demands a good memory. Would be cool with a Blizz version of that.
[6:20:37] enqubas: soft cap layer population to 1500 and hard cap at 2000.  have players in a group be able to right-click leader's portrait to join their layer.

[6:21:22] tuna_sandw1ch: @lordextraordinary lol no
[6:21:24] blazzedzz: @xaryu what about a bloodmoon fog that lowers render distance?
[6:21:27] Lindegaard0: How does horde get to gnomeregan?
[6:21:28] enqubas: @lordsloths yup
[6:21:29] MixedBiscuit: 40-50 lol
[6:21:30] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Malah in the guild
[6:21:30] Elsevier86: I think p3 is just 10 levels
[6:21:34] ButterTubb: For Gnomeregan!!
[6:21:35] Morakod: huh
[6:21:36] skimansr: p3 is 40-50
[6:21:36] largist_: p3 40-50
[6:21:37] PMA_1: thats rav
[6:21:38] Morakod: neat
[6:21:41] bbox16: It's not about render distance
[6:21:44] society1121: i did community college, got AA, then transfered to 4 year uni. biggest money saver in education
[6:21:44] juice42069: that wouldnt help the lag
[6:21:45] spy_bones: thats how pservers handled it, with render distance
[6:21:47] EXiTxi: Adding any graphic tech would make it worse
[6:21:54] tuna_sandw1ch: @society1121 thats they key
[6:21:57] Alfacor: Render distance is on the user PC, not the server
[6:22:02] adrise__: lower render distance would make sense for event stuff
[6:22:02] RingersRealm: That would not work
[6:22:03] Tovone: make a new layer if the event is capped
[6:22:03] b_argy: @EXiTxi this
[6:22:03] Zolshy89: me
[6:22:04] Oztecx: no
[6:22:04] enqubas: render distance would work, BUT i hate it when i join a group and im layered away from the other 4
[6:22:05] pho_rilla: thats user-side
[6:22:05] Elsevier86: no
[6:22:06] BigBabaOne77: i think the distance cant be shorter
[6:22:07] JosieFS: prob the easiest strat but doubt it would fix the lag at all
[6:22:09] juice42069: its not lag in rendering its server load
[6:22:11] buhtterstick: I made WoW. It wouldn't do shit.
[6:22:11] ShutrMcGavin: would not
[6:22:14] Alaska_87: not rever side
[6:22:15] Bolt_: <-- The issue is still compounded by # of players
[6:22:18] morat_g: That'd make strategy interesting
[6:22:19] Elsevier86: server lag is the amount of data being sent to and from the server
[6:22:20] Slaughter13x: @xaryu you remember your days of all nighters on WoW
[6:22:23] NosfeRAtu0202: potato settings
[6:22:26] sj0kken: how would you describe the icy veins icon?
[6:22:27] pho_rilla: server-load, you need legit new servers.
[6:22:28] sauceboifredo: would playing wow ascension fix it?
[6:22:29] morfius09: how about do nothing and wait till people stop playing and lag goes away?
[6:22:29] numblezzz: people confuse framerate lag and server lag way too much
[6:22:34] NosfeRAtu0202: potato settings always fix everything
[6:22:35] n0dai: this will increase the user fps, not the server performances yep
[6:22:36] Frank4LuLz: SERVERS, BETTER HARDWARE FIXES IT, BUT ITS MONEY
[6:22:47] crownhs: @Elsevier86 Which also is exponential with number of players near each other
[6:22:49] blazzedzz: Damn I tried LUL
[6:22:51] enqubas: soft cap 1500, hard cap 2000.  let group members join party leader's layer through their portrait.
[6:22:56] warn1ng: chip implants
[6:22:59] swyftboi: cope
[6:22:59] DlLDUCK: it already exists

[6:23:01] Blindactivity: remember the aq40 opening….
[6:23:02] eskilator_gl: Quantom Servers WICKED
[6:23:03] Elsevier86: likely to fix it they would need to restructure the game and they aren't going to do that for classic so likely not much they gonna do
[6:23:05] jayinthebae: and we'll still be playing Classic..
[6:23:07] 94explorer: in 50 years things gonna be way more advanced than that lmao
[6:23:08] pho_rilla: i'd pay 1$ more on my sub if it meant them getting new servers.

[6:23:54] espi: Classic Plus Plus
[6:23:55] Ronin825: @Xaryu the only way i can see getting zero latency is quantum entanglement based network, cuz then physical distance which is the crutch of network latency would be irrelevant
[6:23:59] n0dai: in 50 years we'll play wow in the metaverse

[6:30:43] juice42069: only downside of mage is yes the hate they get
[6:30:44] frozen_ninja_: Im sold

[6:30:46] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Imagine if you never switched from ret pala
[6:30:48] probablysad: mage only class
[6:30:52] Comanchekilo2: @xaryu start making ur  YouTube videos an hour+ long this is not a request

[6:31:48] athalon: @Zacrilioth yea its dooky

[6:32:00] Zacrilioth: thank God
[6:32:02] ShutrMcGavin: @xaryu do you know how much spell hit you need at 40 for gnomer?

[6:32:21] isFeyz: I'm a boomie main and they feel good now without being broken.
[6:32:22] Bolt_: Just delete the entire Druid class
[6:32:26] BackPains: they got ruined in pve
[6:32:26] Trav_Where: moonkin is good, starsurge alone is just okay
[6:32:27] shadowstorm_sod: Feral needs more buffs
[6:32:27] t_trunkmaf1a_t: Yes i agree, I main a Moonkin and it hurt but still good
[6:32:28] KN0HP: they are still op in world pvp
[6:32:31] jackpepsimba: Mookin prob need help in pve now, but theyre solid in pvp
[6:32:34] TakiitoPotato: now they 2 shot instead of 1 shot
[6:32:42] Merkkinz: I called the change before, it's not even a nerf it just slows the same damage down
[6:32:46] 1cyveins: duckHuh
[6:32:46] rein1715: raptor strike needs nerf
[6:32:51] cthreeplo: moonkin still hurt but feels more balanced. now nerf spriest plz blizz
[6:32:52] Bolt_: Yeah, 2 shot instant cast 600 damage
[6:32:54] Bolt_: yeah
[6:32:58] KN0HP: they have movement speed and can run away anytime
[6:32:59] Merkkinz: I still crit just as high but with starfire now which I have to cast
[6:33:03] Bolt_: just delete the class
[6:33:04] Zacrilioth: i got 1 shot yesterday from mage running pom arcane blast into arcane surge lol
[6:33:06] jackpepsimba: "nuke" that crits for 500? @Xaryu
[6:33:22] smashdakeys: @Xaryu congrats on hitting 40
[6:33:26] smashdakeys: oh wait nvm
[6:33:26] Slaughter13x: @xaryu if lag ever gets tough, imagine playing classic on your first ever rig and you’ll be good
[6:33:27] mkinuka: it was needed even tho it sucks. i mean the dmg in pvp and pve was insane
[6:33:28] Joewrx: thats it. why are you running 2-3? because its OP
[6:33:28] athalon: didnt starsurge range get nerfed?
[6:33:39] cthreeplo: survival hunter is busted, but they have to be melee and no gap closer. so they a glass cannon melee unless with pocket heals
[6:33:41] Tyli67: @athalon not the range, just damage
[6:33:46] 1cyveins: duckWeird druid players
[6:33:47] Merkkinz: range got "nerfed" shortly before the damage did
[6:33:48] blightweller: 30 yard range on starsurge without improved
[6:33:50] Trav_Where: @athalon at the beginning of p2 it did. before the damage nerf
[6:33:53] jjonasp: what do you think of shamans in p2?
[6:34:01] athalon: @Tyli67 pretty sure range is 10 yards instead of 30-40
[6:34:02] dustyd0nuts: do you use any UI addons?
[6:34:05] krebz: love this zones music
[6:34:05] 7thSaga: jimblesSleep rip melee players
[6:34:06] Zacrilioth: why are melee hunters pumping so hard?
[6:34:15] Merkkinz: Hey, it costs 5 hard earned mana.
[6:34:16] Bolt_: Improved is 36 yards though right?
[6:34:17] Tyli67: @athalon oh yeah ? didnt see it in the bluepost, i might be blind :D
[6:34:19] revora_: Funny how druid was OP for 4 days and now apparently everyone hates druids LUL
[6:34:22] jackpepsimba: Yeah it's a rune ability, thats on par with many other classes rune abilities
[6:34:32] Bolt_: Yeah, the solution to everything... Nerf hunters
[6:34:34] DatGuyAnton: Hunters will be nerfed soon no worries
[6:34:36] Kazzator: Fire mage is number 1 now
[6:34:38] rein1715: melee hunter hit harder than a warrior
[6:34:42] xlaughtracks: im excited to get geared and nuke people with elemental sham
[6:34:48] cthreeplo: that is so funny melee hunter hits harder tahn warrior
[6:34:50] revora_: @bolt_ they deserve nerf
[6:34:54] Trav_Where: yeah i'm upset i don't have a hunter. i've dreamt of being a melee hunter but by the time i get one leveled i'm sure it will be nerfed
[6:34:55] Bolt_: Wah wah
[6:34:56] shadowstorm_sod: Got the epic bow and now it's worthless
[6:34:58] 7thSaga: LUL Xar keeps his eye on that hunter horde
[6:35:03] Zacrilioth: would heroic leap be a goodd warrior rune to add?
[6:35:04] Mico027: warrior will scale better with gear than hunter, just wait a bit till they get more raid gear
[6:35:11] Bolt_: Everyone just in here crying about nerfing classes other than their own
[6:35:14] Mico027: happens every phase
[6:35:21] revora_: @bolt_ like yourself LUL
[6:35:22] Kazzator: Warrior is very close to melee hunters
[6:35:24] ajchimica: melee hunters doing well because hunters always do well at beginning of patch, warlocks and fire mages already passed them and warrior not too far behind now
[6:35:36] Shashka76: nothing better than this nostalgic music
[6:35:38] ajchimica: its just BM with a really strong rune for melee build rn
[6:35:42] Shashka76: takes me back 20 years
[6:35:43] modlost: hunters not overtuned
[6:35:46] jjonasp: best pvp class in p2?
[6:35:47] modlost: mages and sp are
[6:35:52] rein1715: disappointed with feral though kinda sucks
[6:35:57] gustakw: what is going to be the best mage build (Pvp and pve)?
[6:35:57] Bolt_: @revora_ Oh yeah, did you pay my wow bill? Cause last I checked, I can't even log in
[6:35:57] sankos1990: hahahahah some low lvl meta lock attacked me, so thanks to your stream i knew i can subjugate him, so took him with me all the way from wetlands to arathi horde base :d
[6:35:57] drekitv: still not 40?
[6:36:00] sankos1990: Thanks xar
[6:36:08] Yandawg: dark rider quest
[6:36:08] Zacrilioth: can mages get more aoe for phase 3 Kappa

[6:36:18] cthreeplo: spriest duuude
[6:36:18] drekitv: rogues needf a nerf
[6:36:18] tsetse2fly: Do you hae scrolls of liminal passage on you? @Xaryu
[6:36:19] chobinhood_: except hunters as always
[6:36:20] Zoismoe: PRIEST
[6:36:21] wldot: melee hunter?
[6:36:21] jiggyspice: The oneshot meta is boring tho. COD has slower TTK than SOD
[6:36:21] Paayne_Music: priest
[6:36:21] sum1thatplaysgames: SWDEATH
[6:36:22] BoriOrtiz: if they fix lagg and layering the event will be so nice
[6:36:23] Merkkinz: I'm happy with my balance, balancing.
[6:36:27] Arthannis: moonkin need a buff
[6:36:27] bigboomer2222: I felt so strong as Mut rogue til i hit 40 and had lvl25 daggers and tried to pvp
[6:36:27] ferknasty: 100% sw death
[6:36:28] drekitv: ROGUES.
[6:36:28] jackpepsimba: @j_mar13 boomy is not OP anymore lmao
[6:36:29] Bolt_: HARD HUH
[6:36:31] Austinnmh: Priest is insane atm
[6:36:33] bbox16: They need the 1800 dmg insta cast
[6:36:33] yami_yugi_87: Everyone complains if they are not the OP class who can 5v1
[6:36:34] Execrable1: Grr
[6:36:35] mozartarmstrong: ziqo got one hit by shadow  word death from 90% hp today
[6:36:37] Frank4LuLz: fire mages too strong, way too strong
[6:36:37] ferknasty: 1k non crit is way to much
[6:36:37] revora_: SW death prob only thing that needs a big nerf yeah
[6:36:40] sum1thatplaysgames: the insane part is...they buffed it so many times...its def not a bug.
[6:36:41] WingsDub: if everyone is complaining about everyone that means it’s balanced!
[6:36:41] Zoismoe: it is fucking slapping bro
[6:36:42] texazbandit: nah leave the classes alone rn
[6:36:42] pho_rilla: arcane surge 100% too strong
[6:36:42] DailyDave: Its not like the ret paladins in retail a while ago
[6:36:43] Eskimodius: Eskimodius subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! :D
[6:36:44] Lukeker: nah cause you can kill yourself, its a gamble button
[6:36:45] hazuki_15: BRO ARCANE MAGE 2K CRIT cant even react to that
[6:36:45] Philopinos: arcane surge doin 3k crits
[6:36:53] DatGuyAnton: I play Spriest please dont nerf :)
[6:36:53] lordhodza: Well....XARYUs need a nerf! For SURE
[6:36:54] KN0HP: i dont think swd is op, the self damage is pretty hard
[6:36:59] alexrose7: Rogues needs buffs
[6:37:00] orpheusnz: im a rogue main and think mutilate is a little OP
[6:37:01] Lzmage: its not a gamble its half self dmg and you can shield
[6:37:03] Trav_Where: someone missed a decimal
[6:37:06] NoGrave: Honestly, priest always get nerfed into the ground and then no one wants to play them anymore.
[6:37:07] Zacrilioth: arcane surge also has a 2min CD, balanced
[6:37:07] Drakielol: Fully
[6:37:11] cthreeplo: there are lesser known bugs they shadow fixed. lock tank rune gave like 40% mana per spell crits before
[6:37:12] Harle13: @KN0HP self dmg doesnt matter if it oneshots you anyway
[6:37:12] isFeyz: @KN0HP self damage doesn't matter when it hits for 1.5k and kills everything lol
[6:37:13] pho_rilla: no chance. 12s cd 50% dmg return. arcane surge hits double it.
[6:37:14] Oztecx: sw death has a 1 dmg = 1 sp spell coefficient. its bugged
[6:37:16] orpheusnz: but im still levelling so that could chnage as i apporach 40
[6:37:16] ittaydawg1: self dmg on sw death sucks ass tho lol
[6:37:21] Badbotqt: @kn0hp but there is no self dmg because everything dies
[6:37:22] texazbandit: let the shadow priests shine sheesh
[6:37:25] zaetemira: i mean shadow word death also kills its caster so im not sure if its a win win situation anyway
[6:37:27] Slaughter13x: @xaryu favorite WoW streamer to raid with?
[6:37:27] Bolt_: Nerf Hunters, Palys, Rogues, Mages, Priests, Druids, and definitely Warlocks.
[6:37:28] jiggyspice: PvP is in the worst state its ever been in. oneshot meta is ZZZZ
[6:37:28] jackpepsimba: I think boomy needs another 10% on starfire or wrath just to keep us scaling with other classes in pve, but that's it. the SS nerf was fair
[6:37:31] Ronin825: @hazuki_15 yeah but its on 2 min CD
[6:37:37] ittaydawg1: @texazbandit lol fr xD
[6:37:39] donato30: Xar would you do a 1v1 in game for gold or for subs on stream
[6:37:43] pho_rilla: No lol
[6:37:44] KN0HP: i disagree i never crit 1.5k in pvp with swd with decent gear lol
[6:37:46] jackpepsimba: @jiggyspice it's just Shadowlands pvp, but in classic
[6:37:50] Flayswow: no it wont in pve ;)
[6:37:51] Execrable1: 50%, then it's useless, should use penance instead
[6:37:53] thewal1ofsleep: LUL true
[6:37:55] zulliuis: Boomkin had their time let priest have their
[6:37:56] GigaCk: LOL
[6:37:57] aSteamedTomato: A TRUE execute, innit?
[6:37:57] low619: low619 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:37:59] heygoditsme: let them shine ICANT
[6:37:59] skimansr: Off to visit Soniis stream, Have a good date night bro! @Xaryu
[6:38:00] keredj: yeah Xar let shadow priest shine
[6:38:00] mumbley: sounds like it is executing then
[6:38:01] Bolt_: It has everything to do with "Let people wreck people by pressing a single button and that's it"
[6:38:01] OrganikCum: it hits like 20% harder than starsurge did...
[6:38:04] Donpepe2811: that means it does execute you
[6:38:05] adrise__: priests killing themselves with swd is funny tho
[6:38:07] Jushijuice: i agree. i almost got 2 shot by it and it barely damaged them back
[6:38:07] low619: <3
[6:38:09] Johnykarate: thats a real exacute xaryu
[6:38:09] pho_rilla: What about arcane surge then hitting 2k+
[6:38:10] FeelsBadWoman: it is an instant cast too, insane spell
[6:38:10] cirque78: Does anyone remember hunter arcane shot pre-patch of burning crusade? nearly one shotting most toons?
[6:38:11] Slaughter13x: @xaryu Favorite WoW streamer to raid with?
[6:38:12] jiggyspice: @jackpepsimba yeah its horrible
[6:38:14] NoGrave: it should be when the enemy/player target is at about 25% life then execute
[6:38:17] CLCgames: xar why no sm spam'
[6:38:17] crownhs: incrase the self damage to 100%, ez fix
[6:38:17] revora_: @zulliuis that was 4 days so priests time is nearly up I guess
[6:38:18] bpwryl: @xaryu do you think the wow in-game music is your top most listened to songs in your life?
[6:38:18] loweery: not doing bad in retail iether tbf
[6:38:21] aSteamedTomato: you place yourself before a shadow priest? You place your head on the chopping block.
[6:38:21] Bolt_: How are people supposed to pvp if they don't have a 1 button kill?
[6:38:22] 7thSaga: jimblesSlash
[6:38:23] smaftyz: how does mage feel in pvp @Xaryu
[6:38:25] shadwarform: Meanwhile i rerolled priest to play enchanc 2H
[6:38:30] Lukeker: if you crit a swd and it doesnt kill... well youre dead
[6:38:34] Ronin825: @Xaryu i can crit 2.5K with it
[6:38:36] Ticcy: just switch it to be an actual execute, usable below 25% hp or something
[6:38:37] pho_rilla: Arcane blast into arcane surge 100-0s my priest with shield on
[6:38:39] Playonwordz: did you get missle barrage yet?
[6:38:40] Zacrilioth: arcane surge is fine... you can kill one person per 2 minutes
[6:38:40] SgtPepperTTV: at least AS takes 100% of your mana
[6:38:42] texazbandit: so is mage so let’s nerf them both then no?
[6:38:42] DatGuyAnton: Arcane surge such useless
[6:38:42] cthreeplo: damn 2.5k SWD??
[6:38:42] Badbotqt: 100% mana on a 3min cd tho
[6:38:44] aujewinashoe: I got 2 shot by a mage, arcane blast, arcane surge, dead. surge did 1800ish dmg.
[6:38:48] smaftyz: I mean shadow word death with low cd instant cast and low mana cost hgits for 1k non crit...
[6:38:48] Udenwo: My chaos bolts are critting for like 2900, but its like 10 seconds of setup time
[6:38:49] Zimy: @Xaryu dunno if the abilitys are too strong or if ppl just are glass cannons tbh, I barely see ppl rocking any stam gear at all
[6:38:49] isFeyz: Arcane  Surge also drains ALL of your mana, so there's a very clear disadvantage lol
[6:38:51] j03seph: wtf do they want out of that rune but one shots lol
[6:38:52] h00lio23: how is he not 40 lol
[6:38:54] winsong: suge cost all your mana though so it has lots of drawbacks no?
[6:38:56] Lzmage: arcane surge 2m cd, pom 3m cd, not 12 sec
[6:38:57] Sarthe: 1239 raiders from Sarthe have joined! 
[6:38:57] sum1thatplaysgames: ok soooo Arcane surge takes your whole mana pool....i think its fine and it requires setup to hit that hard. also it can hit for 3k cause I did it with mine lol
[6:38:59] idothingsdaily: 2k and 0 mana left, probably fine
[6:38:59] winsong: surge*
[6:39:01] holynickel: everything 1 shotting
[6:39:02] cthreeplo: welcome raiders
[6:39:03] sum1thatplaysgames: it only hits for 2k+ if it crits also.
[6:39:05] smaftyz: I mean shadow word death with low cd instant cast and low mana cost hgits for 1k non crit..
[6:39:09] BitLegions: light the blowers on fire
[6:39:11] archhyyyy: Sp op? But we nerf boomy
[6:39:15] mikeeyy22: happy valentines day josh
[6:39:18] MonkeyOverlord: I swear people would find one shots and not talk about them until a patch nerfs
[6:39:18] BitLegions: LUL
[6:39:18] xlaughtracks: remember s1 SL rogue w/ kyrian lol
[6:39:20] Zacrilioth: naw
[6:39:21] MatChad7: Almost 40 dude woohooo
[6:39:22] restless_prince: love you Xar <3
[6:39:26] thewal1ofsleep: resilience?
[6:39:28] BlackRe3per: that's lame
[6:39:31] Herby_Here: but thats no fun
[6:39:32] Brophizzle: !server
[6:39:32] deus_vult25: I agree every patch has something op rarely it doesn't
[6:39:32] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[6:39:35] Zacrilioth: sounds less fun
[6:39:39] neon_wow: If only blizzard had the technology to predict spells killing people in 1 hit at 40.
[6:39:41] Badbotqt: swifty 2 shot macro then
[6:39:42] jackpepsimba: @xlaughtracks SoD P2 giving us 42-0 streams back!?!?!?!
[6:39:45] diirtybum: Shadowlands one shot Prot
[6:39:56] Zimy: @Xaryu Ppl are just glass cannons atm tbh, 0 stam gear
[6:39:57] donato30: Xar would you do a 1v1 in game for gold or for subs on stream
[6:39:57] DatGuyAnton: Swifty new one shot macro EZ
[6:39:59] Hash_berry_: How would you ever do this - gear would be completly irrelevant at this point
[6:40:03] welchungus: sarf raid
[6:40:03] Pocalyps: isn't that what the resilience stat was for?
[6:40:04] Blindactivity: so many stuns it’s hard enough to kill people in retail 30min 2v2 match’s lol
[6:40:06] cthreeplo: Shadowlands convoke spirits
[6:40:09] jiggyspice: is that what classic is about? that makes me sad to hear
[6:40:18] McNerdSauce: the gnomer cloth dps set is wild... lol 800 hp
[6:40:20] TB8008: What do you have against wildlife?
[6:40:20] Badbotqt: sarth 1200 people raid missed
[6:40:21] Zacrilioth: arcane blast into pom arcane blast gets people to like 30-40%
[6:40:22] TaNGoIX: That would normalize every all in ability in a bad way. It's a band aid solution for the actual problem of them balancing.
[6:40:25] grkgemini94: i thought the point of SOD was to transcend the basic notions of classic and make something new... but here we are.....
[6:40:26] smaftyz: phase 2 is wayyyyyyy too oneshotty, its not even fun
[6:40:27] dogsenses: what was 1 shot in retail? i just joined stream
[6:40:30] cov3rt: nearly all of my gear has +sta wtf you on about
[6:40:31] miciahclay: no one has stam gear bc there are so many one shots rn, better to just one shot them first
[6:40:37] Mico027: when people itemize they tend not to care about stamina, so people in STV tend to be squishy
[6:40:37] Jushijuice: @Badbotqt FeelsBadMan rip
[6:40:39] neon_wow: If mage was in the same spot as enhance you would care.
[6:40:45] Glathus: look at melee hunter
[6:40:48] Glathus: this is crazy
[6:40:49] BigDaddyEuro: Raptor Strike with melee runes pens armor, it ignores all armor
[6:40:58] BitLegions: Kappa
[6:41:00] adrise__: what if they made it so you could only cast it at 10% like a true execute
[6:41:00] DakuiOG: Sarthe Raid
[6:41:07] keredj: like Xar Mega healing himself xD
[6:41:13] 0xLisko: i hope they get the sane 50%+ nerf boomies did
[6:41:16] sum1thatplaysgames: Something that is a fun killer with 0 Counterplay needs a fix.
[6:41:17] Paayne_Music: its okey balance now, fix the damn lag now
[6:41:18] Elsevier86: that heal is op
[6:41:19] Xrantin: best mage to exist
[6:41:27] kcm92: as a boomie we 1000000% should have been nerfed but it feeels very odd that they was the only one that got nerfed when there is so much that is just as broken
[6:41:27] Zacrilioth: what a gamer
[6:41:33] gateloz: GIGACHAD
[6:41:36] Glathus: we need pvp items or more stam on raid gear
[6:41:38] cthreeplo: there some nice pvpers
[6:41:41] keredj: GIGACHAD
[6:41:42] deus_vult25: honorable war
[6:41:45] jiggyspice: I just dont want to get onetapped
[6:41:46] neon_wow: Level an enhance
[6:41:48] grkgemini94: the run back here if you die is a marathon too LUL
[6:41:48] DailyDave: xarW xarW
[6:41:49] surgento: implying the game was ever balanced
[6:41:50] dogsenses: that was a GM, they watching ur stream
[6:41:51] NosfeRAtu0202: cs u are not the one dying all the time
[6:41:53] gateloz: Spriest scale badly is the only thing
[6:41:54] BitLegions: he was vybing
[6:41:54] aSteamedTomato: A true hero of Azeroth
[6:41:54] NosfeRAtu0202: just bc of class
[6:41:55] texazbandit: sod just a budget retail seems like at this point lmao
[6:42:01] cthreeplo: SPEAK OF THE DEVIOL
[6:42:02] keredj: think fast Xar
[6:42:02] cthreeplo: HAHAHA
[6:42:05] KosmicDevil_: gg
[6:42:07] Zacrilioth: what people fail to understand is that balanced classes would just be retail
[6:42:07] DailyDave: Damn the priest interrupted the ms paint
[6:42:21] thewal1ofsleep: it's also level 40, not 60. and also, vanilla wow was never balanced LUL
[6:42:24] b_argy: "the homies"
[6:42:24] gateloz: its the same thing with hunters. spriest are good early on but when u get more gear they scale off
[6:42:25] OnlyRift: les hmonculuss
[6:42:26] Badbotqt: forgot to loot staff of jordan
[6:42:27] aadeBirger: Homonculsus
[6:42:29] foam52: you saw him
[6:42:33] Elsevier86: he's not gone
[6:42:34] Xrantin: HES COMING
[6:42:40] smaftyz: @thewal1ofsleep sod is not about level 60. half of sod is below level 60
[6:42:47] obajawanke: wtf the shadowfiend teleports?"
[6:42:55] thewal1ofsleep: @thewal1ofsleep literally exactly what I'm saying
[6:42:58] Xrantin: @smaftyz you can’t get to 60….
[6:42:58] BitLegions: RUNNNNN
[6:42:59] numblezzz: cant use swd with penance
[6:43:01] numblezzz: he doesnt have
[6:43:02] stefkko24: @thewal1ofsleep every game with pvp,classes are unbalanced, is almost impossible to balance classes in pvp, cons/pros
[6:43:02] jackpepsimba: @texazbandit it's 10000% more like the pservers it's being ripped from/based on that anything else imo. Ascension or Duskhaven, and Turtle to a degree
[6:43:10] cthreeplo: ah stream snippers
[6:43:11] jackpepsimba: but I feel you
[6:43:11] thewal1ofsleep: @thewal1ofsleep facts
[6:43:25] eskilator_gl: Shadow Word: Skill
[6:43:31] foam52: the shamans telling him to fuck off
[6:43:34] BitLegions: LOL
[6:43:37] nuhiva: he is running penance which means no shadow word death
[6:43:37] Zacrilioth: it wouldnt be classic wow if ervery class was balanced with each other
[6:43:39] nuhiva: u can kill
[6:43:40] n0dai: haha
[6:43:40] texazbandit: @jackpepsimba I feel that my guy 100%
[6:43:46] DakuiOG: You missed the Sarthe Raid Madge
[6:43:54] Elsevier86: nothing gets in the way of graph time
[6:43:55] cthreeplo: impromptu class tier list?
[6:44:06] Bolt_: Druid definitely on the spectrum
[6:44:06] nonsens27: why is it a scatter graph
[6:44:08] numblezzz: im not understanding the x coordinates
[6:44:09] Shad_WW: @Zacrilioth 1 class being so oppressive that nobody even gets the chance to play isnt fun
[6:44:24] nonsens27: Dude did not do statistics in college
[6:44:26] exteps: why not just explain it like a tier list\
[6:44:30] Xrantin: 500 IQ
[6:44:32] Blindactivity: I feel that’s how retail is now
[6:44:33] OhhYeahhMrKrabs: man u understand what the graph is supposed to be why are you like this chat
[6:44:37] EXiTxi: Standard Deviation is the same for every class
[6:44:38] itsnavarre: So buff warriors
[6:44:40] Xrantin: @nonsens27 just because you can’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s wrong
[6:44:42] Zacrilioth: @Shad_WW im not disagreeing that some things need nerfing, im just saying it shouldn't all be balanced
[6:44:44] bapewho: what do you think about melee hunterr
[6:44:48] Psych0naughty: Well we dont know exactly how things will play out once people have gear
[6:44:54] cthreeplo: what you saying is nerf hunters more NODDERS
[6:44:57] Slaughter13x: @xaryu Let’s just love WoW like we were installing on discs again
[6:45:00] ooTHExTUBEoo: put a movespeed buff on warrior boot rune
[6:45:00] thewal1ofsleep: I like to play a class or build that's strong, but I really only care if it's fun to play and "viable". If it slaps, great, but as long as what's fun it's busted, I'm happy
[6:45:01] Blindactivity: I wish but warriors are killing 2ve terrible 3v3
[6:45:02] Jab1_: i mean people loved classic era and it wasnt even remotely balanced
[6:45:05] shadwarform: Xar i quit priest and rerolled enchanc 2H...
[6:45:06] kcm92: as a boomie we 1000000% should have been nerfed but it feeels very odd that they was the only one that got nerfed when there is so much that is just as broken
[6:45:07] gateloz: I feel like spriest will fix theirselves with gear since they don't scale well
[6:45:07] LoosieJuice: nah the class i play should always 1 shot and never be able to be 1 shot tho
[6:45:10] jiggyspice: I  have gear. 3k hp still getting NUKED by priest
[6:45:11] nonsens27: @Xrantin thats a weak insult
[6:45:12] 1cyveins: @OhhYeahhMrKrabs for real man people are dumb
[6:45:13] joebu123: im an spriest and im having fun
[6:45:13] smaftyz: I mean the gear is hardly much better than bfd gear as caster
[6:45:16] mumbley: make it more rock paper scissors than just a comuple of dominant and non dominate classes?
[6:45:18] Elsevier86: watching you play it is obviously mage is op and needs a nerf
[6:45:19] Xrantin: @nonsens27 but a true one
[6:45:23] DailyDave: Wow devs are discovering the playing field as well
[6:45:30] Blindactivity: they are
[6:45:32] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: i'm a warrior, waiting for fun
[6:45:35] Droobear: Im a boomy and I was having fun ><
[6:45:37] smaftyz: @Elsevier86 Jebaited
[6:45:41] Blindactivity: me as well
[6:45:41] Zacrilioth: jokerd spent like 200g on tailoring helmet
[6:45:42] nonsens27: @Xrantin explain how
[6:45:45] mugenjam: how are shamans?
[6:45:47] MonkeyOverlord: paladins feel very weak.  Our buffs are still short, our aoe is easily replaced, single target is trash...
[6:45:50] kryptogirrl: !server
[6:45:50] StreamElements: SODHC REALM = LAVA LASH NA; SOD REALM = CRUSADER STRIKE NA; HARDCORE REALM = DEFIAS PILLAGER NA
[6:45:54] foam52: Xaryu still thinks you're OP
[6:45:55] zulliuis: you had fun enough on boomy now stuggle lol
[6:45:55] Merkkinz: I'm a boomie and I'm still having fun
[6:45:58] Drukalnn: boomies just mad they have to press starfire now
[6:45:58] faceblurry: no :(
[6:46:00] megafresh15: Moonkin is still strong
[6:46:01] Espriest: we shadow priests and boomies were at the bottom of the chain... its time for us to shine
[6:46:01] Xrantin: @nonsens27 I don’t have to, you didn’t understand it and that proved my point.
[6:46:03] svendvang: not in pve
[6:46:04] thewal1ofsleep: is feral still good?
[6:46:05] guiou125: guiou125 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:46:05] revora_: I am still :) I enjoy the play style of moonkin. I always have
[6:46:07] Arthannis: way less fun they need to up wrath
[6:46:08] Droobear: Its still a good time, just less exciting when a starsurge hits for half the damage
[6:46:09] Grubjaw: My PSU crapped out today, I’m not having fun.
[6:46:11] cthreeplo: maybe spriest is a good thing because more will prob off spec for healer if needed for raids for the future of SoD. Always need more healers even if off spec
[6:46:14] dogsenses: that nerf was big
[6:46:14] fofito369: i think part of the 3 phases is so Blizz have time to test and adjust before lvl 60
[6:46:16] megafresh15: all the FOTM boomkins are crying
[6:46:17] ArsonistEU: what is MITCH doing ??
[6:46:17] gigasnek: Ret would feel better if divine storm or crusader strike did holy damage
[6:46:18] WHOisTHePianoMan: im killing lvl 40 mages as 36 spriest with no problems, its fun but not ok (im not even gooed at pvp)
[6:46:19] MMOLater: @Xaryu asa PVP focused player who dont like PVE which WOW is good to start for first timer?
[6:46:21] NosfeRAtu0202: mks were just having fun just bc they were broken, not for being good
[6:46:22] alexrose7: Rogues needs buffs
[6:46:22] niko5341: Warr are in a bad place rn, but will prob be fixed with some raid gear
[6:46:24] dogsenses: 30% baseline AND spellpower coeffiecent. HUGE nerf
[6:46:27] archhyyyy: Boomie 0 now
[6:46:27] GOSUBO_: @Grubjaw did u put it in rice?
[6:46:28] kirk_hunts: I'm a melee hunter and I'm actually not having fun. Hunter was a fun utility class now I'm expected to press 2 buttons and tunnel bosses to push phases like warrior dps/
[6:46:28] darkc0iL: @Grubjaw is your PSU a mooonkin?
[6:46:34] thewal1ofsleep: what level will phase 3 be?
[6:46:37] alpacabowldood: druids have the most pvp utility and they still want to cry
[6:46:37] blazzedzz: I'm a boomy I'm have fun now the nubs rerolled
[6:46:38] SlashNerfx: it wasnt a big nerf, they just have to press another spell and they are sad because of it
[6:46:39] Execrable1: i'd be okay with a sw:d nerf if they made mindflay more than useless
[6:46:40] nonsens27: @Xrantin It annoys me that you think you are right, but i guess thats a win for you
[6:46:44] Armaerei: I'm feral and got nearly 500 blood last event, i dont feel OP but still having fun
[6:46:50] foam52: kirk_hunts i felt this in my soul
[6:46:54] Hash_berry_: Imagine hotfix nerfing balance, but dont even touch priest at all
[6:46:56] Daddycool_B: a guildie just hit another player for 2K342 with arcane eruption
[6:46:57] Ticcy: sp was fun in p1 too tho
[6:46:58] Hash_berry_: kinda disgusting
[6:46:58] ArsonistEU: will MITCH play P2?
[6:46:58] Garrett4: Garrett4 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[6:47:00] megafresh15: There's always going to be FOTM players who only roll that spec because its completely broken and will cry when it's not anymore
[6:47:04] northernlite: your dad is epic for adding that stipulation to your "wow repayment" contract thanks for youtube comment ill be back wen i can drop prime
[6:47:04] Johnykarate: how long do u think u gonna plat sod or are u gonna play till u just stop having fun
[6:47:08] shamrock55: They should make one class OP for one week and rotate LUL
[6:47:09] ooTHExTUBEoo: I've been vibing on my warrior in PVP idk what the dissapointment is about. Only one I always lose to 1v1 is warlock.
[6:47:11] rustyjeep: ie druids
[6:47:11] kirk_hunts: @Foam52 because it actually sucks that they did this to hunters.
[6:47:13] Xrantin: @nonsens27 it annoys you because it hurts your ego that it’s true. if you understood the graph, you’d know it’s true. closer the dots = more balanced
[6:47:19] Mamagos: I love dying in a blanket silence for 5 sec, 100 to 0
[6:47:21] alrajhio: dont care about their experience. just wanna have fun
[6:47:22] kcm92: they couldnt give boomie a week they have been trash in classic since classic
[6:47:24] liightzouut: its not that good
[6:47:25] spanishdrill__: spanishdrill__ subscribed with Prime. 
[6:47:26] Zoismoe: yep felt it in AB
[6:47:29] liightzouut: it heals alot
[6:47:29] Zoismoe: 100 to 0
[6:47:31] Zoismoe: arcane surge
[6:47:33] adam_brisbane: I am a hunter think raptor strike is to good now but ranged attack is terrible
[6:47:36] foam52: kirk_hunts we're the only class that cant do another role and now we're not even what made us unique anymore lol
[6:47:36] Zacrilioth: have you reached out to mitch since he talked about being assaulted?
[6:47:37] sending123: arcane surge as arcane hits garanteed 1.4k non crit
[6:47:38] Slaughter13x: let’s all just delete all the priests @xaryu
[6:47:39] liightzouut: but if you get kicked while casting it, youre dead
[6:47:39] Jushijuice: LUL
[6:47:40] hazuki_15: YES i got 2069 dead
[6:47:43] Grimadin: ziqo hit 3k this morning
[6:47:44] papieggroll: poggers in the lair!
[6:47:45] grkgemini94: if you let a mage free cast 4 arcane blasts you deserve to get 1 shot
[6:47:46] Drakazagra: lol
[6:47:46] isFeyz: KEKW
[6:47:46] Morlac13579: priest discord is finding ways to nerf swd to bring it more into line

[7:04:46] unhinged_srt: your doing it for the fodder mostly
[7:04:46] espi: @Hobblets never goes to the bathroom
[7:04:48] WcWillow: lay down when you go afk
[7:04:48] dersdog1: convienient to do when taking a break tho
[7:04:48] EXiTxi: That math doesnt check out
[7:04:49] DakuiOG: the fodder is big
[7:04:50] Daddycool_B: it's not true, it depends on your pace of xp/hour

[7:05:05] deus_vult25: you can do something else in the meantime
[7:05:09] swifty1116: That's how u test it. Xp grind for 3 mins
[7:05:10] Fewis_: 3 min in SM>exp from bag
[7:05:11] qom99: using the bag from 25-40 gets you the equivalent of 1/2 a level between 39-40 so its worth it
[7:05:12] parabellum2213: only benifits you if you have to go afk...
[7:05:16] DannyShotgun: you’re a real opportunity cost kinda guy lol
