[0:08:33] Teyren: What quest window addon is Lula using?
[0:08:33] projectgrave: Can someone tell me what the quest addon Lula is using is called?
[0:08:35] Sollice: I would love it if she thinks she does something great for the Jailer and then he turns around and kills her because her anima is the last he needs for this plan
[0:08:44] indiegarona: Tyrande is kind of becoming her.

[0:09:01] Thunderlops: this is zone is awesome
[0:09:06] daddy_dolby: @Towelliee Her torture is re-living her conversion over from Arthas.
[0:09:08] KILLJOY4455: this is world of WARcraft not world of lets hold hands
[0:09:15] apopthis: I mean at this point. Is she right though? I mean, the world really could use a reset
[0:09:40] bmj80: @apopthis true
[0:09:43] osatox: seems she's driven on Revenge
[0:09:53] TialePetit: I was happy to see lady Vashj
[0:10:01] Sollice: @apopthis The problem is she may be doing it for Azeroth, but you have to remember ALL worlds and dimensions, known and unknown are broken. She is screwing over the entire universe
[0:10:18] xstraightbrutal: i hope we see Zul Jin again
[0:10:30] Dalrend7640: sometimes the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many xD
[0:10:33] TheKitsuneAdventures: i want nathos head on a spike and the jailer just laughing at it
[0:10:45] b3njie: How long has our king towel been getting them z's
[0:10:46] osatox: @TialePetit IIRC Vashj was still "alive" during the Ny'alotha raid, when did she die?
[0:10:48] Sincline387: so good he picked sylvanas
[0:10:54] KushDaddy03: is that towel in a bed?? haha wtf

[0:11:10] Needdaann: Drakka and Thrall need to have a mom and son moment :D
[0:11:19] royhandlesit: its buggy
[0:11:21] Sollice: I like, at this point, they aren't shoving Thrall back down the horde neck. Like make him warchief again so far
[0:11:29] osatox: OH IM THINKING OF AZSHARA IM STUPID LUL

[0:11:59] xALcaPWNedx: Jeez, I jumped on a little deal from costco for a 32 inch LG monitor, 165hz 1ms . . i love it!
[0:12:02] Sollice: Azshara is out in the void waiting for the next expansion when Illidan and Sargeras come back to rescue us
[0:12:09] osatox: SAFE SPACE
[0:12:11] osatox: WASH FACE
[0:12:12] KILLJOY4455: the undead were fighting to protect their people and were cursed and killed then were rejected by the people they died for protecting...... let em burn
[0:12:12] MoodyVanessa: the only last boss we actually killed in BFA was Ghuun Keepo
[0:12:14] psycothedruid: as an ally. wouldn't be mad with luthemar being your next war chief
[0:12:19] Boozehound: @osatox Confusing two female nagas for each other. That's racist. Kappa Kappa
[0:12:19] psycothedruid: really don't want it to be bane
[0:12:20] authorized411: azshara should be, she's 10000 years old, lol
[0:12:21] Digitaldragon754: Is hogger still alive or would he be somewhere in shadowlands?
[0:12:22] Herzenliegen: @sollice LUL
[0:12:30] apopthis: @Sollice True, it does. But the only thing I keep thinking is this woman is so damn broken because of Arthass, all she can see is the end game. Not saying she needs put down, but I think it's very much for a good reason
[0:12:31] gtmax69: A dropped a tear when Ysara came out of the wild seed
[0:12:35] Sollice: It's true watch for it :) Space expansion next !

[2:59:17] Activ3X: Sushi+
[2:59:26] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves i mean yeah but.. maybe it's just the side of game development I see. I don't understand it. For a full game with game breaking bugs like Valhalla I understand, but with xpacs for MMOs I don't get it
[2:59:28] arturoo09: lmao
[2:59:28] mmrghost7: anyone on draenor is in the game rightnow ?

[2:59:53] Doedje: towellieee dreams of wow anyway so we just hooked the hard up to his brain and this is what happens.
[3:00:24] realTINTAX: new technology lets you screenshot while your sleeping PogChamp

[3:01:05] ascended696: Dude is Towlie sleeping in the same room as you playing lula?
[3:01:09] capricore: Y’all don’t wanna see my dreams
[3:01:13] DragonofWolves: psycothedruid yeah well, its something called ragequitting, or rage refunding. You can expect people to understand MMO's or the work that goes into it, and some have a distaste for blizzard. remember that
[3:01:15] ascended696: Idk how people can sleep like that
[3:01:23] DragonofWolves: can't*
[3:01:32] Indamoment: @ascended696 with their eyes closed?
[3:01:35] realTINTAX: @ascended696 laying down?

[3:02:55] ascended696: lol
[3:03:15] realTINTAX: clearly he can play while sleeping PogChamp
[3:03:29] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves that's fair. I was a game development major in college and worked on a few indie games with friends, fans can be rude as hell for sure
[3:03:31] UberManDude: Lula!!!!!!!!
[3:03:46] vexed247: @dragonofwolves It's not about rage quitting - I can't quit something I can't actually use.
[3:03:50] TheGinjahNinja: Lula whats your favorite zone so far?

[3:05:31] Zurithil: Im looking at a iLvl 21 sword on AH for 166k
[3:05:41] cookiemonstersex: "If you're level 60 in shadowlands it means you got no life, no friends and are unemploye" - Asmongold LUL true
[3:05:46] Thelocogringo: doesnt mean it will sell
[3:05:56] psycothedruid: Nope but I guess I just have low expectations. Look at Modern Warfare, a year and it still makes GTX and RTX GPUs shit themselves and they just can't be asked to fix it haha @vexed247
[3:06:11] Fangy_Playz: I'm not a peasant
[3:06:22] rLocks: Wake that dude up.....LOL
[3:06:34] DragonofWolves: vexed247 thats your choice and i understand that. i wasn't talking about you in general. Just when it comes to blizz, gotta keep expectations low.
[3:06:53] psycothedruid: ^^
[3:07:12] Thunderbrew: People need a reason to complain.
[3:07:15] vexed247: @psycothedruid I get that we need to manage our expectations around a launch but there are a lot of people in the EU who just can not access the game or if they do it is unplayable.
[3:07:16] ijuki: @Prezzet Sigh
[3:07:16] Yordie_Sanders: Dr. Lula hittin us with the truths
[3:07:39] Kerasto: Sleeping all day ^^
[3:07:39] DragonofWolves: Honestly, when it comes to blizzard, you can't really have high exoectations
[3:08:03] Kruorem: playing in the evenings for EU just hasn't been possible. massive lag and 3 hour queues.
[3:08:06] psycothedruid: @vexed247 I wonder why it's hitting EU so hard though. Who knows if it's the work from home conditions or what, it seems odd to me that it's affecting one region so much worse than another
[3:08:38] Brodih_: @psycothedruid the servers must be in 2 different locations

[3:09:06] Redhed_Iou: huh? LUL
[3:09:15] cyhrslle: how is this possible? are you sleep-streaming??!
[3:09:17] psycothedruid: @Qhaz_ lmao I mean yeah, but the devs normally keep both going strong,but there have also been a crap ton of EU job postings
[3:09:20] DragonofWolves: psycothedruid towelliee was saying earilier that they should have trust launch day stress tests. didnt they do that for previous expansions? i cant remember
[3:09:21] Zurithil: i mean, lets look at the facts. We have MILLIONS of people in quarantines and lockdowns. SO what once was good enough for the multitudes, is now being put under stresses that werent entirely expected
[3:09:44] cyhrslle: are you sleep-streaming? LMFAO
[3:09:47] Cricke00: how does he play when he is sleeping?
[3:09:50] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves they did. I think the delay messed up the stress tests
[3:10:00] Zurithil: And secondly, We've been nearing a point in our infrastructure of the internet backbones that have been heading towards bottle necks for years
[3:10:07] Redhed_Iou: only pro gamers can play in their sleep
[3:10:10] Mazuma19: lula the mutherfucking legend
[3:10:15] Haigro: someone lese is playing with his permission
[3:10:19] HaxzorJimDuggan: the keyboard and mouse are on the other side of the mattress Kappa
[3:10:20] DragonofWolves: psycothedruid for BfA and Legion right? or was it just Legion? i dont remember BfA having a stress test
[3:10:22] vexed247: @psycothedruid Possibly - I just know that unless people vote with their wallets nothing will change.

[3:10:40] psycothedruid: @vexed247 friggan true. unfortunately
[3:11:05] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves Yeah they did at least dungeon stress tests for BfA, and all around tests for Legion. Both smooth af, didn't want a WoD repeat
[3:11:10] cookiemonstersex: Sleep is for casuals
[3:11:11] Victaeron: Anyone knows what happens to Renown levels, chapter progress and so on if you swish covenant for the first time?

[3:11:52] DragonofWolves: psycothedruid yeah just COVID has taken a toll on a lot of shit.. bah just want this crap to be over you know?
[3:12:10] SonofHorus82: It's only been a few hours and Lula is awesome. Get over it.
[3:12:22] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves same. hardcore same. Comcast just released a statement that they're removing the unlimited plans from everyone and charging people $10 per gig over their 1TB cap again.
[3:12:30] XNViciousZ: He's moviong
[3:12:36] Tipsybasil: Hi Lu!
[3:12:40] psycothedruid: Didn't clarify if it's for people like me who paid for the unlimited cap before it was granted to everyone or not
[3:13:05] Beriech: @Victaeron All of your covenant progress is saved but when you change you start from renown 1 with the new covenant... so if you go back to the original Cov you pick up where you left off
[3:13:07] BadFoxtrot: Should everyone have a crafting/gathering profession?
[3:13:14] subnuub: lmao so u ppl watching a stream of a sleeping dude ? my god... this is disturbing
[3:13:16] MrGattz: i cant imagine how much internet i use per month.. i think last time i checked it was like 5tb or something..
[3:13:20] psycothedruid: @BadFoxtrot I'm a masochist so I run enchant and tailor
[3:13:38] DragonofWolves: psycothedruid that sucks, i have spectrum so im good on that end.
[3:13:42] psycothedruid: @MrGattz I'm at about that as well, between working from home and streaming/games, plus my fiancee watching netflix and such
[3:14:01] Victaeron: @Beriech thanks
[3:14:14] BadFoxtrot: I focused on only leveling so now I'm in Bastion with no professions LUL
[3:14:17] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves I had spectrum when I lived in Michigan. Switched to comcast when I moved to Nashville. I live in like the one suburb that doesn't have AT&T or Google fiber, go figure. Should be moving in March though
[3:14:31] TheGinjahNinja: OLD

[3:14:47] Deathkanigit101: ignorant, uneducated
[3:14:50] capricore: Too rich to understand the issue
[3:14:51] BadFoxtrot: @TheGinjahNinja Yeah that's the word LUL
[3:14:53] bodli1125: @Towelliee welcome to germany its the same here even worst
[3:14:58] psycothedruid: @Towelliee Lula it won't work :( I started an ISP when I was in Michigan that was "backed by the government" and they did literally nothing to help, no matter how much lobbying we did
[3:14:59] smashwow: technologically ignorant/challenged
[3:15:01] DragonofWolves: I have spectrum in Florida, i think i pay like $75 a month for 100 down 60 up
[3:15:05] HaxzorJimDuggan: my parents still have a 3mb line no other options available except satellite which is over priced
[3:15:11] DanielDotWav: My mom took pictures of the photos on her tablet to transfer them onto her phone :) (crying internally)
[3:15:16] gidgeet: I have Xfinity aka Comcast with unlimited Data
[3:15:21] CrimsonNurse: You just need lots of money to lobby their votes
[3:15:24] DanielDotWav: these people decide over your internet LUL
[3:15:46] ipendora: Who do you think invented the internet?!
[3:15:51] apopthis: Lula - I can tell you how it is from a smaller ISP if you want.
[3:15:53] DragonofWolves: thomas edison
[3:15:56] DragonofWolves: LOL Kappa
[3:15:57] psycothedruid: @dragonofwolves I'm paying $130 for 1GB down and 300 up, but it averages out to only 400ish down because cable. I just want fiber lol
[3:15:59] capricore: @ipendora Al Gore of course
[3:16:17] sussyrev: still find it creepy that towelliee is streaming himself sleeping
[3:16:31] MrGattz: im paying like $90 for 300/20. love spectrum..
[3:16:32] DanielDotWav: why? i always watch him sleep
[3:16:35] DanielDotWav: Kappa
[3:16:35] psycothedruid: @apopthis it's a rough time. my isp only had about 400 customers but it was part of the rural broadband project in michigan they were trying to do and it was rough
[3:16:36] capricore: @psycothedruid I have Fios, but the damn condo I bought isn’t wired for Ethernet and I’m not tearing the walls to wire it up
[3:16:39] ijuki: I pay $30 for fiber, sounds good to me
[3:16:43] ipendora: Lol
[3:16:51] gidgeet: I have Fiber but the company is not that known around here. Metronet, I want Verizon Fios or Google Fiber
[3:16:54] sussyrev: i pay 70 for 35 down riPepperonis
[3:16:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: i pay $65 for 200 down 20 up with a 700 gig monthly limit
[3:17:08] psycothedruid: @capricore dude this house was built wired up, but comcast ran the coax to the wrong side of the house so I'd have to rerun it myself if I wanted it to actually work hahaha
[3:17:10] devaston: Glad to see you back Hank. i had to get sleep, unfortunately.
[3:17:13] DragonofWolves: Well i think it all depends on where you live for spectrum, and pricing
[3:17:25] MadGoatHS: It’s a simple fix for Congress. Term limits. A lot of people in congress were in politics before the internet was a thing
[3:17:31] apopthis: So @Towelliee from a smaller ISP who provides Fiber in Kansas. We actually get almost no funding from the government. Everything we provide is funded from us and our customers. When it comes to the bigger companies we have to actually pay them as well for pipe access.
[3:17:36] Mostdangspy: my girlfriend just made a pie and she doesn't like the way it looks. Should I convince her to make a new one so I can eat the whole pie myself?
[3:17:49] DragonofWolves: Mostdangspy why not lol
[3:18:03] capricore: @mostdangspy pro gamer move
[3:18:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: 2 pies greater than 1
[3:18:39] apopthis: @psycothedruid it is. Rural broadband projects are great...but smaller ISPs almost always lose the bid because we don't have the big dick cash to throw at them
[3:18:41] highroller31: i'm thinking about throwing down the forty clams for Shadowlands. the zones seem nice enough that just questing might be worth it
[3:18:59] Mostdangspy: haha true. and its my favorite...pumpkin

[7:17:50] Comrade_Reaper: yeah it give 568 haste/crit/mastery it can also give mana if healer is 20% mana or heal someone 20% hp or break CC and spawn a decoy that taunts if you got aggro @Towelliee
[7:17:53] PrimalRain: yeah
[7:17:59] Unt4med: its a shitty week for a lot of people
[7:18:01] Aro725: Wait till raid comes out
[7:18:04] night__monkey: people are hype for Naxx not this
[7:18:05] SlonkiJippi: people list interest in modern wow
[7:18:06] Secondbreakfasttt: i feel so comfy right know; i get ridoff neck and the back... i'm officaly over BFA towJesus
[7:18:06] Apheelia: Holidays dude!
[7:18:09] JackedDown: Crazy too, because this is a great expansion
[7:18:11] TurboTineke12: It will be back when world first raid starts
[7:18:12] krisqo86: of course when I decide to check WoW out after a few years my authenticator is borked fml
[7:18:13] kbeltz85: i think BFA just left such a sour taste in people's mouths, they have a lot of trust to earn back
[7:18:13] AudioJaq: If youre leveling faster than some, people may wanna avoid spoilers
[7:18:14] Narodigg: I think part of that was missing race hype to max level
[7:18:16] radiorahem: i mean thanksgiving is tomorrow
[7:18:16] ZyntosAran: @night__monkey lul
[7:18:18] PrimalRain: it doesn't help there's not a ton to do
[7:18:18] Zellidon: @Towelliee It's cause people are PLAYING and not just checking it out anymore
[7:18:19] oradros: @Comrade_Reaper its the loaded dice roll of shadowland pretty much
[7:18:19] DutDuck: i know for me it didnt have the same hype partly with the level cap being hit so fast
[7:18:22] Ozrockz: Really? I think that everyone is too busy actually playing the game than commenting about it online @Towelliee
[7:18:23] Lukaii: because everbody could play themselves @Towelliee
[7:18:24] LosDuervo: might have had some bots too
[7:18:25] lekkahdh: you were stuck in black screen all day, that happened Kappa
[7:18:27] kc7hif: the quests were worse than bfa
[7:18:29] UberManDude: @Towelliee Reason being is because twitch did not really advertise it. Twitch is advertising Cyber Punk bro. Watch when that come out, it will hit 1 mill.
[7:18:33] kc7hif: leveling experience
[7:18:40] Apheelia: too busy playing to watch?
[7:18:42] SeckSymbols: Yeah but this year is differnet, we have already been at home
[7:18:44] Broomba: first day hype is normal especially when login boss is raid boss
[7:18:46] Iver_monk: Maybe the content is too easy to get through
[7:18:47] Mystirose: IT'S really hard to play and watch at the same time.
[7:18:49] xxrecneps: during wow launch day, they had random lifestyle streams on the front page lol
[7:18:49] SeckSymbols: Holidays are no different than any other day
[7:18:51] Ras_Aku: tourists don't have the dedication to wait for the log in ques
[7:18:51] ShockASU: @Towelliee There are a lot of other games out there now
[7:18:52] Crystalyzee: people prob watched while they were in black screen dc's the first night then they logged in and turned off the stream
[7:18:53] Comrade_Reaper: oradros its stupid op imagine that one from m+14 prob going to be 2k stats
[7:18:57] Hybridwarhawk: I think it seems more people are enjoying playing this expansion
[7:19:01] Mystirose: I mostly listen
[7:19:01] Slitze: if i see you with more then 6 ppl this Thanksgiving and you're in Oregon, I'm calling the police
[7:19:02] TurboTineke12: People only watch streams when they are in Que
[7:19:03] SeckSymbols: I think that is wishful thinking
[7:19:04] nightlight20: its a really good expantion so far
[7:19:07] ProClicker: Xpac doesn't have an important lore character as an enemy
[7:19:08] Holysal: that was me not watching lol
[7:19:12] nightlight20: much better then BFA
[7:19:14] rawz0ne: Well ive havent played for like 10 years and returned to this
[7:19:15] xMortal_Wombatx: Is the maw on a daily or weekly lockout?
[7:19:19] Apheelia: I think its amazing so far and im only 56
[7:19:19] Deekan33: @Towelliee think most are staying away cause they dont want to get spoilers from story
[7:19:20] PrimalRain: yeah the story is really good
[7:19:21] theDirtyon3: @ProClicker you must not be paying attention
[7:19:29] Karbonn: So far they've knocked it out of park with the Expansion imo.
[7:19:30] wolfkinn: i watch while at work then play when i get done for the day
[7:19:31] SeckSymbols: We dont know jack shit about the Jailer though
[7:19:34] elchaposkjelbo: Turalyon gon be a boss
[7:19:34] SeckSymbols: So he isnt an important lore character
[7:19:35] DrewShing: what's your favorite area so far in Shadowlands?
[7:19:36] night__monkey: yeah but nobody cares about him
[7:19:36] xebren01: Maybe it could’ve been something with new consoles coming out this year? and more upcoming games coming? Idk neither
[7:19:37] Apheelia: Jailer scares me!
[7:19:37] SeckSymbols: He isnt Nzoth
[7:19:39] Lukaii: jailer is badass
[7:19:39] ShockASU: @Towelliee Plus think of it like this: People enjoying expansion because it's not BFA cohhGG
[7:19:41] Broomba: @towelliee -- i feel like SL is an Ion expansion -- system, lore, etc
[7:19:42] xMortal_Wombatx: Finally long weekend - and now I can finally start to play Shadowlands towHAMUP towHAMUP
[7:19:43] Darkhopp: Im honestly loving the expac. the leveling process is nice and streamlined .
[7:19:44] JumpTroopC5: @towelliee I am watching less because I don’t want things spoiled
[7:19:53] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: Alexandros Mograine, Ysera, Houndmaster Loksey
[7:19:54] UberManDude: @Darkhopp Facts!
[7:19:56] theDirtyon3: @Secksymbols why should we? we know enough to know that he is very bad
[7:20:14] Sadisticmedic: @Secksymbols no but I see a return of a character from BFA
[7:20:17] SeckSymbols: @theDirtyon3 I am responding to the fact he isnt an important lore character like previous expansions
[7:20:25] ProClicker: @theDirtyon3 Jailer has no lore history
[7:20:26] Salfurium: This expansion feels a bit "detached". Somewhat like WoD lore wise. We will see how the characters develop and what impact it will have on "our world".
[7:20:33] Comrade_Reaper: i felt that the mythic zero was very easy this expansion
[7:20:35] Ace11575x: was fine all day just gpt dcd and 40 min q NOOOOOOOOOOO
[7:20:37] Crystalyzee: @Slitze cool i guess..but im sure they will be to busy elsewhere
[7:20:48] Iver_monk: Gaming is saturated with releases maybe?
[7:20:56] TomtenKJ: @Towelliee can you show the transmog for the new raid on plate?
[7:21:02] ExpoUhl: Do you think the quick leveling did it?
[7:21:09] Slitze: @Crystalyzee right. i just watch the governor i nearly shit my pants

[7:21:21] maggiras: @Towelliee what do you spend your Anima on in the "Order Hall" can't decide what building to build first
[7:21:23] Comrade_Reaper: i am loving shadowlands tho
[7:21:26] Spintaru: just got off work... and i'm in a 40 minute queue
[7:21:28] Sranjola: Bfa was hyped as hell
[7:21:31] Eternaalll: maybe cause it was streamed a lot in beta?
[7:21:31] kc7hif: becuz people were hyped up with legion thinking bfa was going to be better
[7:21:35] DrewShing: i'd say 5th gen consoles did have huge impact
[7:21:36] Wrecknado: legion was pretty decent
[7:21:36] LochNess: It's because everyone is in Shadowlands enjoying it
[7:21:40] paintednpierced: Id say as the big stream contests end... the views do
[7:21:40] kylern58: for me it's that legion was really good so the hype going into bfa was high and fun to play along and watch. I quit during bfa and so far through watching, tho I enjoy watching, shadowlands isn't making me want to resub
[7:21:42] bgriff87: I very well could be the new gen consoles.
[7:21:43] night__monkey: because legion was great and bfa was good at the start til people realized bfa sucked so there's no hype for SL since bfa was shit
[7:21:46] SeckSymbols: Servers arent an issue right now
[7:21:54] TweakT: maybe november is also a busier month
[7:21:54] HonestPhilosophy: Consoles coming out makes sense
[7:21:54] freebeee: well it didn't release smoothly? release date set back, again log in troubles. ppl get tierd of it?
[7:21:56] UberManDude: @Towelliee I will say. When it comes to gaming in general and because of Covid, the numbers has gone up.

[7:22:09] LochNess: Could be holidays and the delayed release
[7:22:10] drunch85: twitch dead confirmed Kappa
[7:22:10] resergz: on viewership, do you think it was due to how good Legion was and high expectations for BFA?
[7:22:13] Onearmyof2: I mean I think people are just playing it instead of watching twitch
[7:22:21] ProClicker: Unboxing Pokemon cards gets all the viewers now
[7:22:34] Slitze: @Crystalyzee call the cops on your neighbor if you see more then 6 ppl at a thanksgiving dinner

[7:22:34] UberManDude: @ProClicker Lol wut?

[7:23:01] CatoireLore: @Towelliee kill the shades around him and he will spawn
[7:23:07] FutileDiploma: @Towelliee i am stick on this damn quest where i need the horn to kill the boss but hes bugged at 0% and wont drop
[7:23:08] UberManDude: @tano_cosplay Could be. Before WoW change the xpac date I already had my date set for time off. When they changed it, I was like so disappointed.

[8:39:24] rhk_: 2h
[8:39:26] korickss: 2h
[8:39:27] Exodeo_: 2h
[8:39:27] QPOrbis: @Zurithil 2h
[8:39:27] Praetour: @gtmax69 fair enough, less of the kit is useful with 2h than?

[12:10:55] Matt1218: What server are you on cus Im in que for illdan at 3k lmao
[12:11:05] DragonofWolves: but i think the covenant sanctum upgrade system is actually rewarding unlike the azerite system and people actually like it? idk
[12:11:06] TaNGoIX: !addons
[12:11:06] RPGSauce: 100% is

[12:11:16] raldrik: its because loot triggers a server call that isnt buffered
[12:11:19] Malac1te: @towelliee hey bro, I got a question. For the Druid, I want to try and play all the roles no matter the content, but I wanna know if you have any suggestions for covenant?
[12:11:22] spellrunnerz: They are shutting down the realms
[12:11:23] Kromede: perhaps elvui turned on fast loot
[12:11:24] gillychrist: @towelliee sure you have had this question 8 million times but .... what’s the best covenant for prot in mythic plus ?
[12:11:24] NSDGamingChannel: NSDGamingChannel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[12:11:26] Quantizati0n: @Towelliee sorry if it's been asked constantly but can you explain your reasoning for going Venthyr over Kyrian?
[12:11:31] MOLAR305: keys
[12:11:42] fadofbr: Enjoying so dar?
[12:11:46] Twigz_KC: just poured myself a delicious Basil Hayden, good shit
[12:11:52] Wulfenst: @gillychrist for paladins Venthyrs abilitiy is vastly superior.
[12:11:57] xPebs: Anyone know shortest 3 dungeons?
[12:12:24] MOLAR305: sanguine is pretty sort also
[12:12:46] ripquantum: @Towelliee How do you get the souls for upgrading your sanctum? I know there is a weekly in the maw but is there more?
[12:12:57] fadofbr: Enjoying shadowlands so far?
[12:13:00] Wulfenst: @Quantizati0n venthyrs ability is vastly superior compared to Kyrian for AOE, specifically since paladins are some of the best aoe tanks.
[12:13:24] CipansR_Ayaya: that mount looks amazing
[12:13:26] Meigosh: catJAM
[12:13:27] willy_billy_silly: what is that mount
[12:13:28] bigchodeehaver: is that a new moiunt? looks sick

[12:13:35] ZeethianDragon: Where you find torghast?
[12:13:36] LoseAlotLuke: catJAM
[12:13:38] Quantizati0n: @Wulfenst I can see that for raid tanking but 4 min CD for mythic+ seems... meh. But the soulbinds for Venthyr seem really good
[12:13:39] raldrik: sounds like something that would have been on the NES. Mike tysons punchout or something
[12:13:39] silverknight16: It sounds like a Sonic level theme.
[12:13:40] drhoser: towDmca
[12:13:41] Thunderbrew: How do you get the map labels?
[12:13:43] LoseAlotLuke: very much catjam worthy @Towelliee
[12:13:45] NinjaTexan: a nice montage
[12:13:46] LoseAlotLuke: catJAM

[12:13:56] damnflanders: damnflanders subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[12:13:59] NSDGamingChannel: sounds like some old school double dragon music
[12:14:05] CDubTheRIPper: catJAM
[12:14:08] Iver_monk: Yup montage music
[12:14:11] scoodush: training montage vibes
[12:14:13] Wulfenst: @Quantizati0n i mean realistically is having a shorter cd ability that does meh damage/things overall better?
[12:14:15] griffdog125: THE BOTTOM BRICK
[12:14:23] domoss93: ilvl?
[12:14:25] TMMOOF: Alright, Step, 1, 2, Step
[12:14:25] chukudu: how do you recruit more basic troops for the command table please ?
[12:14:31] bigchodeehaver: SLUG MOUNT
[12:14:39] cripnozz: How do u get that mount?
[12:14:45] Twigz_KC: sounds like the sound track to the type of movie the guys from Rifftrax would make fun of, lol
[12:14:47] Quantizati0n: @Wulfenst it's more the free 5 holy power every minute that appeals. Especially with how stupidly powerful word of glory is right now
[12:15:00] DeeKeeezy: que up guys kekw
[12:15:12] faulen: Token's are so cheep right now. Like 118k

[12:15:33] nichtdiemama: @Towelliee what would you say is the best choice for ret as conv if im not raiding just more doing dungeons and stuff? Not sure if i should use NF or KYR tbh.
[12:15:46] krysanthimum: i wish i had ppl to play with regularly... i have to pug all the time which takes forever just to do a dungeon
[12:16:02] Quantizati0n: @Wulfenst Was hoping he could give a breakdown of his reasoning but my guess is that he's been talking about it constantly so oh well
[12:16:08] NSDGamingChannel: gezz darkmoon cards are still a thing. figured they would be obsolete by now

[12:19:30] Zerodur1: The leveling is much faster the second time - did it today in maybe 3/4 of the time my first run through
[12:19:50] xo_navi: unforch
[12:20:10] Racerover: bouncy panda
[12:20:14] Ebony71: I didnt choose, I want to see if a mount is involved
[12:20:16] ZeethianDragon: Unfortunate.
[12:20:56] Racerover: gotta complete them all for covenants... rip
[12:21:04] FruckAwesome: is it better to skip story on second toon?
[12:21:04] Varchon: Throwing out your back usually means you've strained the muscles in your back. Lifting heavy objects or bending forward in an awkward position are common muscle strain causes. The pain that muscle strain produces is usually right around your lower back and no further
[12:21:18] blrwllm: i thnk u have to fruck ?
[12:21:32] FruckAwesome: no... you have an option

[12:21:54] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee so whats the verdict. do we do threads of fate or just the story?
[12:21:56] blrwllm: i think choosing is better
[12:21:59] xo_navi: I remember once i had sciatic nerve pain it fucked me up for a week
[12:21:59] Starmander: @Zerodur1 Was that doing the story again or threads of fate?
[12:22:16] FruckAwesome: then you need to level on world stuff or dungeons...
[12:22:21] DecayedmiNt: @FranciscoTHEmage Threads will likely be better even if it is slightly slower. Since you get to start covenant stuff at 50
[12:22:30] blrwllm: i guess it depends on what u mean by better then
[12:23:02] FruckAwesome: faster
[12:23:16] kelanimate: what covenant is best for ret pally?
[12:23:18] FruckAwesome: or better to level the covenant as fast as possible..
[12:23:21] stephennaru: you have to get the barrels to feed him around the area
[12:23:21] blrwllm: i rather not do all those escort quests again lol

[15:28:29] neuton23: ok
[15:28:38] AccidentalBard: the regular version just has a touch too much lag for me, so getting timing was a bitch @Drakenking
[15:28:39] GoodEnough4Me: yeah, he was on this morning
[15:28:41] divinebeefs: he was streaming everyday
[15:28:46] superluboss: is dungeons fastest way to level?
[15:28:49] Drakenking: @StageRight that might honestly just be server lag right now lol
[15:28:50] phragg: O-o i think by getting dc'd one of my questlines got fucked up
[15:28:51] xideontv: 26mins q to log into Illidan
[15:29:00] killawatts75: @cdougs that’s not helpful to state even if someone is that’s not how you tell them.
[15:29:16] LosDuervo: the one that I found annoying was that one where you get tossed up off the flower petals in the sky and have to float down on another to go higher.
[15:29:22] AccidentalBard: @Drakenking tru

[15:34:11] CADZtv: threads of fate is actaully pog idea
[15:34:15] killawatts75: I feel it also depends on ur tank there are a lot of new tanks who don’t know how much to pull and stray on the safe safe for short small pulls making dungeons seem longer

[15:58:51] CrimsonNurse: I heard there is a mount in Torghast is that true?
[15:59:05] Sherbert1492: @Towelliee im lvl 54 and not done with bastion is that okie
[15:59:11] sukmyturban: So what is quicker threads of fate on your own if you dont have a group to dungeon lvl or the quests ?
[15:59:18] morethrowback: how are bear tanks doing in shadowlands?
[15:59:18] Daddy__Winston: if this was SWTOR you could let them die :)
[15:59:26] Beakar: dungeon leveling looks pretty quick :)
[15:59:38] Just2Nasty801: yes it is
[15:59:59] CushyPop: Can you enter Torghast immediately after hitting 60 or are there other quest you have to do?
[16:00:02] TiwazFo5: i was 55 and some change lol yea
[16:00:11] swoody1867: I dinged in ardenweald
[16:00:24] Ranger208: I stopped doing side quests and only focus on main quests unless I'm under-leveled.

[16:00:25] krysanthimum: yeah i was 59 when i got to revendreth on my first toon...
[16:00:27] Bayne77: yeah i had to do the last half of the story line in revendreath at 60
[16:00:30] Cru3: i was 56 when i left bastion
[16:00:31] metavahn231: i think we are at that point again where level 52s do more damage than level 60s in dungeons
[16:00:33] Boots_Malone: So is there no real point in doing anything but the campaign if it gets you to 60 and u gotta do it all anyway?
[16:00:34] Truthseeker96: you get the covenant stuff after doing campaign idk why ppl are weirded out by not getting it at 60
[16:00:35] Vynos_: Yee i got 60 in Revendreth with 4/7 in the Campaign
[16:00:38] CrimsonNurse: Blizzard put a lot of exp into this expansion
[16:00:43] CushyPop: ok, cool, thx
[16:00:44] Frippe_TV: i did only the campagin + the bonus objectives and some wanted quests, i dinged 60 when i had 2 quests left in revendreth
[16:00:46] RageerPLZ: I can finally do mythics and actually get invited to some, only had to buy 150k item to make the ilvl point for heroics
[16:00:46] Sadisticmedic: @Towelliee I just got to Revendreth at 59 and 70%
[16:00:48] divinebeefs: i hope
[16:00:49] osofuerte: I liked Rivendreth and Maldraxxus the best. I would play those again. Just let me skip Ardenweald please.
[16:00:59] Scoodles91: can you skip the maw intro ?
[16:01:04] Quann1337: im 85 % into 59 and still in ardenweald
[16:01:20] wdforty_88: what lvl are u now
[16:01:24] LGilbert1982: I found the best way is to do only story quests except for in the zone that you plan to be covenant for. Do all of that zone for rep and flight paths. Doing it that way ensures you hit 60 just before you finish the story to unlock the covenants.

He was an idealist and was not fond of the demonic allies and warlock magic he was forced to use in combat. He questioned why he was no longer allowed to try and communicate with the elements and the ancestors, in response to Gul'dan's orders. Durotan was unable to provide a real answer, instead telling him to keep quiet , he was a real orc shaman :)

[16:59:59] Chopstix2005: @nazzari01 correct
[17:00:14] beandipperyamean: Brewmaster just kinda feels like playing an AOE heavy DPS character, it doesn't even feel like tanking to me.
[17:01:16] beandipperyamean: I love it.
[17:01:24] Fearrless: @nazzari01 yep have to build a group and walk there for mythic

[17:02:42] TheRavenGrave: Stagger Can Not Be Fixed
[17:02:44] DaRukus: I don't think Mists has teh Stagger, I remember them being shit tanks back then

[17:03:27] MVPeteTV: is it possible to get 1250 soul ash this week?
[17:03:28] beandipperyamean: Honestly, up until Shadowlands, I had completely disregarded the Brewmaster, all I could remember was spamming kegsmash on the ground years ago and I never looked back. Happy I finally gave it another go.
[17:03:38] snoo_32: well stagger helps monk be tanks. They can do dodge or make monks wear plate, and they can't givethem flat damage reduction
[17:03:42] HasjSNAke: Good morning towHi towHAMUP
[17:03:51] snoo_32: they cant*
[17:03:59] snoo_32: so stagger is the monk's thing

I would also love to get into both PvP and Raiding one day. Could you perhaps advice me a class that does good DPS (always have been a true DPS player at heart) in both these things? And preferably a class that goes a bit easier on a new player :)

[17:44:42] Dherjee: @gmoney170 i got 9 mythic items equipped
[17:44:42] gingerbasterd: Anyone familiar with making the items for legendries? I am looking at the recipe and there are 4 different amounts listed for the mats. Which should I go by?
[17:44:43] Daveybutter: @Towelliee should Blizz dial back the xp gain? 55 at the end of bastion seems too high.
[17:44:57] Chopstix2005: @gingerbasterd Rank 1 lego craft
[17:45:01] TheRavenGrave: i don't think DK are that hard
[17:45:06] Gundams33d: Hey!!!...Ok Ye...You Right
[17:45:24] Ekvision: dk pull shit to them they don't walk much
[17:45:25] Decoyszn: How was Monk DPS in raids for BFA?
[17:45:25] gingerbasterd: @gingerbasterd Is that the lowest cost recepie?
[17:45:53] Chopstix2005: @gingerbasterd I believe so. Could always check wowhead
[17:45:58] Flyingmeat: What is the fastest way to level alts now ? Still story line ?

[17:46:10] Chopstix2005: @Flyingmeat dungeons
[17:46:20] Flyingmeat: Thanks @Chopstix2005
[17:46:26] Monger_Ops: I was 60 before I even went to Maldraxxus
[17:46:29] Decoyszn: Fastest would be dungeons, but you have to do the storyline at some point for your covenant
[17:46:33] beandipperyamean: Is Towelliee planning to stick with Pally for Shadowlands as main tank?
[17:46:41] PvtHudson093: i got 5 levels in Bastion because of the alliance warmode 30% bonus exp
[17:46:54] Chopstix2005: @PvtHudson093 thats illiegal

[17:47:56] Chopstix2005: @ZBernhardt it has a install script when you log in with ELVui
[17:48:08] safeway10: its about 1.2k for me for herbs
[17:48:11] sotsil_: 1k per node @Towelliee
[17:48:27] safeway10: horde
[17:48:30] PoppaShot: horde
[17:48:38] PoppaShot: i was getting 1.2-1.3
[17:48:38] Flyingmeat: Why does alliance get more ?
[17:48:40] Decoyszn: Anyone have an idea of how monks will be in pvp?
[17:48:46] conwats: 1.2k per node and I'm Alliance
[17:48:48] sotsil_: @Towelliee 1.3k ally
[17:48:58] Masqerader: @conwats wm on or off?
[17:49:00] pertsem: !uptime
[17:49:02] Rock_tart: Is there anyone who does dungeon runs talking through what going on and what abilities their using? Would make a good tutorial/reference.
[17:49:02] Mons00: do we need complete all story line for covenants if i level alt or if i skip story and level alt with dgs will covenants be able to choose ?
[17:49:03] Decoyszn: Alliance get more cause they are outnumbered in pvp
[17:49:05] conwats: WM on
[17:49:18] whiteout3713: so how does threads work with dungeons. do you hsve to go quest even if u hit max level?
[17:49:24] Decoyszn: @mons00 you have to do the campaign, no way around it
[17:49:35] Chopstix2005: @rock_tart Tankspot?
[17:49:40] SteLawBro: @Flyingmeat To make up for the time they spend in the graveyard. Alliance having warmode on, for me at least, is probably a net loss overall.
[17:49:46] Masqerader: i personally think the exp buff should have been disabled for week 1
[17:50:00] Flyingmeat: hahaa @stelawbro ouch
[17:50:03] smoggs95: is he realy already 57 hours awake?
[17:50:06] Rock_tart: @rock_tart I'll have them a look thanks
[17:50:15] Mons00: @itsdecoyszn thank you, then skilpi
[17:50:17] Decoyszn: Agreed @masqerader - 5-6 hours leveling is pretty quick IMO
[17:50:36] Liquid_vsop: How many characters have you lvl to 60?
[17:50:37] Mons00: skipping campaign has no meaning then
[17:50:40] Stormagedden91: @rock_tart Fatboss

[17:51:47] Chopstix2005: @Stormagedden91 ahhh lol ok. I usually just read wowhead guides lol
[17:51:55] SteLawBro: I tried the warmode on thing but never really found any fair fights. It was always like 1v7. On top of that you have to wait for sometimes up to 10 horde groups to kill named mobs for quests so you actually end up losing exp with it on.
[17:52:09] Deadelus0: Morning! towHi
[17:52:35] D3V1L_MAN: @stelawbro You definitely need a group
[17:52:48] mrbrindle23: Morning all! towRed

[17:53:38] Decoyszn: The hell is ToF hah
[17:53:42] snoo_32: contrary to popular belief, alliance are pretty good at teamwork and helping each other out. But individual wise, horde are better players and 1v1 horde almost always win
[17:53:53] Cntrl11120: How far into the 240 hour stream are ya ?

[17:54:15] Rock_tart: 1v1 horde don't win if I'm the horde :)
[17:54:17] PaulieeB: I just got an ad on twitch of sire denathrius cgi
[17:54:23] Decoyszn: Yah @vurax1 but you have to do the campaign at some point
[17:54:23] Chopstix2005: @rock_tart lol
[17:54:38] SteLawBro: @holyanimal99 I mean its not really about skill or anything like that. Sharding just feels wonky. Looking around and see'ing nothing but a sea of red names is pretty normal.
[17:54:39] vurax1: @ItsDecoySZN i thought u can sskip the campaign iwht threads of fate
[17:54:56] Decoyszn: I could be wrong but not that I know of

[21:10:23] Rudric_Ice: Maldraxxus was my least favorite zone out of all other zones
[21:10:29] MuhannaM: @2chest_1head I've heard alot of people saying that, is it really that good?
[21:10:30] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[21:10:32] quakegoogl: lol
[21:10:45] Aphex_fr: @Tiger_Ice agreed. A real nightmare
[21:10:48] Robodope: no way maldraxxus rules
[21:11:03] rayguiss: @Towelliee : do u think Method with their new roster can make a decent comeback ?
[21:11:07] Robodope: ashbringer dude
[21:11:15] BrowneePoints: Maldraxxus was a fun zone
[21:11:20] warrenny: @tiger_ice Necrolords great prob my fav zone
[21:11:21] xPete: I like them a lot, but somethings gotta be the "worst"
[21:11:27] Imtheguy15: yea maldraxxus was best zone i thought
[21:11:31] JamesWaudby: How's the leveling speed during threads of fate?
[21:11:33] Bearrdman: Ardenweald was the worst imo
[21:11:41] Teidran: really? i loved it. i think drakka is the warlord we deserved instead of silvanas ahaha
[21:11:45] Anxsy: I ended up really liking maldraxxus story alot
[21:11:48] Robodope: yeah I didn't like ardenweald, except the very end of the story
[21:11:51] warrenny: Kyrians worst they seem messed up
[21:11:52] 2chest_1head: @itsMuhanna leftovers for making sandwiches? Yes lol. Cause you put stuffing in em. Make like a whole diner in the sandwich lol
[21:11:58] The_Nubtub: I don’t care anything for ardenweald. Which sucks because their ability is really fun
[21:11:58] CrawlerCarl_: mal's my fav zone
[21:12:00] aksel______: i still preferd maldarxus over bastion tbh
[21:12:07] Craznman: the only questing i liked was in argenweald and that's because it was so over the top silly
[21:12:11] Craznman: ardenweald*
[21:12:21] Thunderbrew: Do we like any of the zones?
[21:12:26] snoo_32: i thought ardenweald was the worsts. The quests didn't feel good for me. I thought that it was a terrible block of grind to go through 70 quests or 7 chapters. It really was a battle of fatigue to 60 in ardeanweld imo
[21:12:33] Shrenko: and Ardenweald is beautifuul
[21:12:36] Zpiria: revendreth was really fast imo
[21:12:42] jj_ptv: God so much NPC lines to listen to :(
[21:12:43] metavahn231: i like the vampire zone the most
[21:12:50] metavahn231: that place is bloodborne

[21:12:52] Wrizzik: leftovers: take stuffing and roll it into balls, and put it in the oven/toaster oven. Holy balls!
[21:12:52] 2chest_1head: Ardenweald has a great soundtrack
[21:12:57] Anxsy: Ravendreth story was great
[21:13:15] Strewgle: revendreth is great
[21:13:16] kofijuve: do you think that magic find should be in wow as stat

[21:14:16] iRegretn0thing: @Veramer Crying for Tyrande
[21:14:22] Imtheguy15: @Towelliee since no mounting in maw they should done like vashir in cata give us a movment speed buff when we are there
[21:14:27] flanders61: i gotta say i like the look of the Bastion armour set for plate
[21:14:30] Nuboc: what a trooper. How do you play for 270 hours continuously?
[21:14:32] 無職提督: malf? being a little pussy ass as always
[21:14:33] BrowneePoints: @Towelliee I mean, Ardenweald told us that Winter Queen and Elune are SISTERS too! That's HUGE lore news!
[21:14:33] skazz__: you already got a second character to 60? @Towelliee
[21:14:37] snoo_32: i also think that the reason i didn't like ardeanweld was my gear was a little low and my dps was sloppy to kill stuff at 58
[21:14:43] TacticalWee: she is going to be a raid boss i just know it
[21:14:49] Nightz101: Malfurion likes that foreplay
[21:14:59] Kromede: my bear has no problems in the maw KEKW
[21:14:59] suitguytv: Just play druid
[21:15:11] BrowneePoints: @Towelliee She flat out called ysera "my sister's Pet"
[21:15:15] ColdIceCreamMan: She was probably talking about Eonar
[21:15:16] Bel_Daeva: She did though - "My sister's pet" when referring to Ysera.
[21:15:19] CriticalPhil: i unlocked the transportation system in the maw
[21:15:24] smartiekidd: shes eonars sister not elune lol
[21:15:27] Craizar: may have been referring to Eonar actually
[21:15:36] meischa_: How long was threads of fate to get to 60 I just tuned in
[21:15:40] TheFabilolz: Wtf ? are you lvl 60 on your monk ?
[21:15:41] Craizar: titans seem to be on the eteranal ones level
[21:15:43] Zerofkgiven: are the world quests any good in shadowlands?
[21:15:47] BrowneePoints: Ysera is more closely related to Elune than Eonar @smartiekidd
[21:15:55] Craizar: elune would be above them as a first one
[21:15:55] Qoax: Not elune but eonar and winter queen are sisters
[21:16:34] Alaquane: powerful panda piss
[21:16:35] p0werslav3: money shot
[21:16:35] PadidinJones: Yep
[21:16:37] Thor2k4: @Towelliee we all know.. hogger was the FIRST one :D
[21:16:40] smartiekidd: @BrowneePoints theres literally a WQ calling ysera Eonars pet
[21:16:42] Zerofkgiven: is this the jailor?
[21:16:48] Wrizzik: ...it burns when he pees?
[21:16:56] NickCarnegie: Fire dick
[21:16:57] crossfire_omg: Thats cool
[21:17:06] FatChase: First ones are older than the jailer, and theres no way Eonar is a first one
[21:17:10] thebeardedcanadian2: @Zerofkgiven No he is the runecarver
[21:17:17] boeiee: atleast he can scratch his back now
[21:17:19] crossfire_omg: he is having a nap
[21:17:21] PadidinJones: I wonder if we ever release him
[21:17:24] TheSynchronos: at least he can scratch his ass now

[21:17:59] Eshel: 2 hops this time ....
[21:17:59] Rudric_Ice: maldraxxus story wasn't bad is that the zone was pretty cramped and full of trash packs everywhere just like nazjatar without flying

[31:34:28] SpoofAvatar: better than warfronts and islands
[31:34:28] MrGattz: idk i enjoy a lot but i also think they could have did a bit more
[31:34:31] MOXP: @mrgattz freudian typo "dont think" LUL
[31:34:39] ImOnlyTom: whats better for Venthyr the Transport Network or the Anima Conductor
[31:35:09] Endin: I'm losing my god damn mind with these long world quests and no whistle
[31:35:15] 20secgaming: towelliee hows prot for shadowlands todays my catchup day
[31:35:18] MrGattz: @schilder you know it was a typo but after thinking about it for a second i kinda agree with the typo. i have very mixed feeling about sl so far at this time
[31:35:27] MOXP: game just feels empty and scuffed imo
[31:35:55] MrGattz: i will say the music and the art is fucking beautiful though
[31:35:59] FarmerClovis: LUL
[31:36:05] MOXP: @mrgattz same ye, i see the potential but it's not quiet there yet

[31:36:13] 20secgaming: prefect
[31:36:18] bekindtoeachothr: ive had fun no complaints really for me the world quests have been long but im not in a hurry
[31:36:28] MrGattz: the new world quests seem to be purposefully longer for no reason imo.
[31:36:28] Mightbeworth: which are you picking for DK? and are is there one that is good for all 3 specs? @Towelliee
[31:36:29] the_biek: the nimbus cloud?? ;)
[31:36:30] 20secgaming: how long did it take to 60
[31:36:31] PoGelo: How I can get more those Redeemed Souls?
[31:36:46] MOXP: music and art was always S tier imo. it's always about the gameplay
[31:36:52] LoseAlotLuke: Ony is so cute sleeping on the bed when your sleepin @Towelliee

[31:37:42] MagiMetal: I actually really like the maw -_-, I'm also not a mythic player really. The whole jailer's eye thing feels cool from an immersion perspective instead of just "your dailies are done".

[32:23:15] Rainadin: The fact that Ashen Hallow makes me do more DPS on bosses than DPS will probably get it nerfed cause people will complain they don't feel relevent. I love it so much lol.
[32:23:28] Sanctana827: @Broseidon_91 make sure you do layer 3 on both parts of torghast, and complete the quest that gives 200

[32:28:38] Spintaru: Do it for the FUN of it
[32:28:50] RazorKameo: @SorionZ no clue. i havent tested that. my guess would be no since theres an achievement for killing all bosses

[32:29:26] darthsabre: @Ziathion That tends to happen when a new expansion comes out. They nerf gold making in previous expansions so people playing via the battle chest edition can't easily make gold and play Shadowlands "for free" :)

[33:40:04] plate_of_food: @paintednpierced but couldn't you just abuse it by having 4 guys being locked? 1 guy gets all the loot
[33:40:07] deathlady392: It’s been that way for years
[33:40:10] IcingdeathTwinkles: You could abuse it and run dungeons with 4 people saved and 1 person would get all the gear
[33:40:14] Venocta: then you could just go with 4 locked and the last guy get all the loot
[33:40:16] Fayrgrus: that would eb an exploit, people would just sell 4 man saved dungeons for guaranteen loot on every boss
[33:40:18] 3verfett: not how that works
[33:40:19] WTHeckman: If it didnt work like it does then you could funnel all the loot to one person. It is actually working as intended
[33:40:20] Syllvn: Nah if it was sent to the others, take 4 locked and the 5th gets all the loot. Too abusable
[33:40:21] amerecasual: What expansion would you say has best dungeons to learn tanking? I'm leveling my first tank
[33:40:34] neblivion: @MerePlebeian i would recommend burning crusade. Dungeons are good to play and difficult enough that you need to use defensive's
[33:40:38] royhandlesit: that wouldnt be exploitable at all
[33:41:08] deathlady392: That isn’t an exploit, been that way for years. If someone’s locked then that person won’t get you hear

[37:54:45] Fangy_Playz: @towelliee I spent the first couple of days just grinding herbs and ore I just reached Revendreth before I had to head to work.
[37:54:57] STEELSOUL69GAMING: 3k isnt bad
[37:55:33] Abomenation: Hey towelliee I haven't played wow in a year. How is the game now?

[37:56:25] Drakenking: Idk, sanguine depths is pretty awful on some pull
[37:56:32] Fangy_Playz: I'm terrified to try to level my rogue that's on Illidan
[37:56:32] shadez1: @Towelliee are you guys runing 2x tanks ? prot and brew ?
[37:56:46] MysticalOS: btw make sure to reach out to me if you find any trash warnings are missing @Towelliee or any warnings that do exist don't appear to be working right

[37:56:59] MysticalOS: Glad to see you using alpha though so you saw I already fixed the bladestorm and haywire warnings. :)
[37:57:07] Hitmanblood: ya the phasing really sucks right now
[37:57:08] ShyNeferpitou: I'd buy a level 60 boost if they offered them once you did the leveling process once
[37:57:10] Radtvlol: makes the game feel dead, really bad
[37:57:17] Drakenking: @fangy_playz I havent had any issues at all thus far, its really about when you get a chance to log on whether there is big queues or not, for me the biggest ive had was 30m
[37:57:31] Nonnpoint: lol goto maldraxxas in warmode its packed af

[37:57:56] Drakenking: Once i got past bastion I didnt see any alliance
[37:57:59] DrewShing: you think this limited phasing is a temporary thing to address the week 1 volume or is it gonna be like this from here on out?
[37:57:59] Fangy_Playz: My warlock is on Zuljin its jampacked
[37:58:05] Hitmanblood: ya illidan has so much alliance on my phase.
[37:58:10] Grulkthar: honestly i like the solo questing as it makes the story a bit better. endgame is kinda boring with the heavy phasing tho
[37:58:14] MysticalOS: anyone that's pvping is dong it in bgs to actually get 171 gear. out in world is waste of time

[40:01:20] viiscerall: you gonna be streaming raids?
[40:01:20] kaylis_hayasei: @Azphelle Right now Venthyr is coming out as the strongest overall choice for Havoc Demon Hunter, but not by much. Sinful Brand Icon Sinful Brand has good applications for both single-target and burst AoE, and while the cooldown for AoE is limited by Metamorphosis Icon Metamorphosis, the damage it can do is really powerful. It also comes with some good Soulbind options that start out strong and have good flexibility, especially Nadjia the Mistblade.
[40:01:25] kaylis_hayasei: sorry for big paragraph
[40:01:32] WestCoastCait: How do I get back to The Maw from Oribos? cant figure it out
