[0:20:49] MachoCham: I'm not sure how it works but are you having to build a new type of audience up
[0:21:16] keyboardturner: is it something to do with tags maybe? personally for me i rarely see shorts because id on't click on them, they give me super unrelated videos

[0:30:13] Layliah79: so odd
[0:30:33] breninn3: People are insane, if you don't like someone don't interact with them
[0:30:34] keyboardturner: all of his replies are really weirdChamp
[0:30:38] breninn3: Just scroll past LUL
[0:31:16] apollymae: they just want the attention
[0:31:30] keyboardturner: i think it's underwhelmign and not the archaeology revamp we want
[0:31:42] KaisenSiru: anniesHmm
[0:32:03] keyboardturner: there's still no rep rewards it's crazy
[0:32:06] keyboardturner: and no description

[0:32:25] Layliah79: it says "A Learned Azerothian Archivist"
[0:32:28] MachoCham: 10.2.6 isn't out
[0:32:29] keyboardturner: it's completely bizarre idk what's going with that
[0:32:48] Layliah79: oh yeah!!!! nothing
[0:33:00] Layliah79: maybe this is just a "test"?
[0:33:22] Layliah79: rep takes forever to get
[0:33:30] breninn3: Does anyone else get a notification to say Renowned Explorer title has been removed everytime they log into retail? I've earned the achievement in previous expacs, do I need to do it again for the new zones?
[0:33:31] Layliah79: and all the currency.
[0:33:46] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[0:33:48] Layliah79: it's a known bug
[0:34:02] BBMezzy: I'm also fairly certain the archives had very little to no focus in their social media posts promoting 10.2.5 content. They know what they released was bad
[0:34:05] breninn3: Yeah the title is gone too
[0:34:24] Layliah79: yep it's gone
[0:34:43] Annathebanana1986: Afternoon ðŸ˜Š

[0:34:56] MachoCham: I hope the wife doesn't find out
[0:35:32] breninn3: Partner is working all weekend, so I'll be juggling the parrot and dog duties. Real life parrot isn't as easy as the one I tamed in WoW
[0:35:43] Layliah79: i watched the documentary on Netflix about Rick Flair. Wow what a life he lead. I didn't know he was adopted either.
[0:35:56] Layliah79: yes
[0:36:00] Layliah79: it was really good
[0:36:00] apollymae: dart tournament
[0:36:58] Layliah79: she looking forward to it?
[0:37:01] breninn3: He's quiet compared to must parrots, loud in comparison to dog. Mimics the dogs bark when someone knocks the door which is hilarious
[0:37:13] Layliah79: aww :(
[0:38:02] Volryn: LUL
[0:38:52] Annathebanana1986: He was brill ðŸ˜„ we got told if we went out during the event we weren't allowed to come back in.. even if it was to go to the loo LUL. Also someone decided to attempt to jump of the bridge near the theatre before the event so there were loads of police around the area, I wondered what the hell I was walking into haha
[0:40:10] MachoCham: Doesn't surprise me tbh
[0:40:21] Elrathir: mrgmO
[0:40:23] Layliah79: wow that's crazy

[0:53:37] Haestoh: Nah that Love Rocket reaction was top tier.
[0:53:37] MachoCham: @Annathebanana1986 We went to taskmaster live last year, was great!
[0:53:58] Layliah79: Colin Mochrie has always been my fav on the show.
[0:54:17] MachoCham: Did you wake up at the nearest pokecenter?
[0:54:20] Annathebanana1986: Oh wow, they must be really getting on now, I remember watching it with my parents LUL @layliah79

[0:55:46] MediumRareOG: SL will be so much easier at 80 than 70
[0:55:46] MachoCham: Sort the addon out for completionism content first of all
[0:55:54] skewlbeta: the only bad cats are in video games
[0:55:58] physalis4: SL completionism is a grind with all the covenants
[0:56:06] MachoCham: Yeah the overlay
[0:56:24] Annathebanana1986: Nice @machocham, it's so funny how they come up with randoms things for the tasks
[0:56:24] MachoCham: mrgmHehe
[0:56:36] MediumRareOG: Wochi catching strays LULW
[0:56:51] coversRbetter: by completionist we man literally everything like transmog and stuff or only achievements?

[0:57:29] MediumRareOG: Path of Annoyance
[0:57:31] keyboardturner: faceroll easy
[0:57:36] keyboardturner: just grindy with the anima cost
[0:57:38] MachoCham: You 100% nailed the word "of"
[0:57:39] coversRbetter: it always was easy, what do you mean
[0:57:44] Annathebanana1986: Its just annoying
[0:58:15] physalis4: I wish they'd go back and reduce anima costs of everything
[0:58:27] MediumRareOG: Think I've got 800K anima. Still short grateful offerings. And genesis motes
[0:58:32] keyboardturner: of course they are
[0:58:33] Dashric: they will get over it
[0:58:37] goekenaitor: asmon viewers are going to be soooo mad
[0:58:43] keyboardturner: they're also gonna be like "why can't i transmog all types of armor"
[0:58:45] BBMezzy: Of course, they've heard what they wanted to hear and reality is going to be different
[0:58:55] Elrathir: @keyboardturner LUL
[0:58:59] apollymae: they are always upset over something
[0:59:02] keyboardturner: and also "why aren't these class skins"
[0:59:24] bojackhorseman2004: Dark Ranger
[0:59:33] bojackhorseman2004: Which is for MM and BM?
[0:59:48] bojackhorseman2004: when it should been for MM and Surv
[0:59:50] skewlbeta: They were gonna take your lunch money lol
[1:00:00] bojackhorseman2004: Sylvanas has littrarly fought with a knife before
[1:00:13] jskillz777: no it shouldnt be for survival
[1:00:24] jskillz777: it says ranger in the name
[1:00:32] jskillz777: ranger with ranged weapon
[1:00:47] bojackhorseman2004: Dark rangers are based off sylvanas, Sylvanas fights from both range and melee
[1:00:48] BBMezzy: The Dark ranger tree was very underwhelming from a BM point of view.. it was much better for MM
[1:00:56] Dashric: I dunno how wow streamers can be so clueless about the game they stream
[1:01:12] keyboardturner: i mean to be fair it's a big game
[1:01:45] StreamElements: Isle of Dorn Zone Preview - The War Within (Pre-Alpha) | #worldofwarcraft #warcraft #gaming #shorts - https://youtu.be/bCyGbTUz7Is
[1:01:46] jskillz777: i want to do dark ranger to see how it goes
[1:01:49] skewlbeta: all wow streamers must memorize all 20 years of WoW content and the other, what 15 of warcraft lore. It's known.
[1:02:04] Jelky55: waaaaaaaaaaaadap
[1:02:07] Annathebanana1986: I don't have a fucking clue about wow and I've been playing since the beginning of time LUL
[1:02:08] Jelky55: still not 40?? smh
[1:02:09] Jelky55: :p
[1:02:15] bojackhorseman2004: its not actually mrgm playing, hes just commenting over pre played gameplay Kappa
[1:02:29] keyboardturner: prerecorded stream
[1:02:45] Dashric: many folks aren't doing trading post until the last day of the month
[1:02:51] Jelky55: what did i missed , tl dr me xd
[1:02:53] audemus22: Ive played since 05 and im terrible at the game still
[1:03:05] bojackhorseman2004: Idk, loads of wow streamers dont know part of wow. But wow is a big game and people do different things
[1:03:11] bojackhorseman2004: parts
[1:03:59] Dashric: maybe I am just finding the Neurotypical streamers
[1:04:38] bojackhorseman2004: I got banned in FemTVs channel becuse i ganked him in shadowlands beta and then told him in chat .(
[1:04:56] Jelky55: no, ur supposed to play the game i play xd
[1:05:05] Jelky55: your way is bad
[1:05:10] Jelky55: i love those comments
[1:05:12] physalis4: We're very much in a Twitch/Twitter bubble too. There are plenty of WoW players that aren't part of this "world"
[1:05:19] bojackhorseman2004: He was testing somthing for warmode
[1:05:33] bojackhorseman2004: like repfarming optimazation
[1:05:42] Annathebanana1986: I sit in valdrakken all day
[1:05:48] CloudyHS: do you think its possible to maintain the classic playerbase long term? it seems like it largely rides on new releases, i just wonder how many new things they can come up with
[1:05:52] S3N71: @bojackhorseman2004 He probably banned you for stream sniping, as opposed to PvP per se
[1:06:26] fumennen: do you think that the .07 will be immediately after heartstone event or a few weeks after it?
[1:06:37] bojackhorseman2004: @S3N71 It was just for the lols, i would kill mrgm to if i met him in a pvp enviorment :)
[1:06:45] CloudyHS: i hope they can keep that playerbase happy, im a retail player but its always healthy having a good population for both versions
[1:06:54] Akela3: that's a pretty consistent trend across games today. active players come and go with seasonal content
[1:07:05] S3N71: @S3N71 I get that.  But I can see both sides of the cion :)

[1:07:44] bojackhorseman2004: Do you guys really trust modern blizzard to make completly new content for classic?
[1:07:45] CloudyHS: the hearthstone event ends on monday the 18th for NA, so it tracks for 10.2.6 to be on the 19th tuesday
[1:07:46] bojackhorseman2004: like dungeons
[1:08:10] Jelky55: oh btw gz on KSM :p break time till Fated from keys huh :D
[1:08:40] CloudyHS: i know a lot of people are stuck in perma doom about blizzard, but its just stubborn to not realize we're dealing with a completely different wow team than we had in 2020 / SL era, theyve earned my trust back
[1:08:45] physalis4: Time to get KSH now
[1:08:48] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:08:52] Jelky55: well its certainly gna be this year, but idk the month
[1:09:17] CloudyHS: d4
[1:09:27] BBMezzy: So now that you're a M+ pro, did you like this season's dungeons?
[1:09:30] albuquerquez_joze: Ga,mepass

[1:09:58] albuquerquez_joze: Wow will get there too
[1:10:02] Jelky55: i mean it was kinda expected ye
[1:10:04] Jelky55: for wow to come eventually
[1:10:05] CloudyHS: i cant see wow being on gamepass, no way
[1:10:06] albuquerquez_joze: maybe a diferent subscription
[1:10:10] physalis4: D4 cuz of controller support
[1:10:13] skewlbeta: next is rumble for sure
[1:10:16] jskillz777: because its a banger
[1:10:39] jskillz777: meep
[1:10:40] albuquerquez_joze: probably a premium subscription Blizzard + Xbox
[1:10:48] CloudyHS: wow is unique with its subscription model, i cant see microsoft wanting to cut out 50% of the sub money by adding wow to gamepass
[1:11:11] bojackhorseman2004: game pass says its for "$9.99/mo"
[1:11:14] albuquerquez_joze: expansions will be paid for sure
[1:11:16] HaloS23: think that means wow as well? i dont think so imo
[1:11:26] albuquerquez_joze: u have to pay dlcs in gamepass too
[1:11:37] S3N71: I get my GamePass through EE
[1:11:41] bojackhorseman2004: they would lose money adding it to the gamepass
[1:12:00] CloudyHS: neither, honestly
[1:12:04] Thoreya: neither, but gamepass
[1:12:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[1:12:20] CloudyHS: im not against it, i just dont think theyll do it
[1:12:28] albuquerquez_joze: I think its not bad
[1:12:30] Layliah79: would it keep the subs?
[1:12:31] albuquerquez_joze: makes sense
[1:12:31] jskillz777: too much drama
[1:12:44] physalis4: review bombs idk
[1:12:47] fumennen: for us is not for the company is losing money
[1:12:47] Thoreya: if it goes F2P, more p2w maybe
[1:12:50] Annathebanana1986: We love drama though
[1:12:59] bojackhorseman2004: the issue is, it be easier to track my game time and thats just depressing
[1:13:01] physalis4: not a reason to keep it off
[1:13:12] theszoti: if i launch wow from steam and it just starts battle.net, then no thank you
[1:13:15] Annathebanana1986: Never will it be F2P
[1:13:18] albuquerquez_joze: probably u will have the option off just Wow and the other with gamepass
[1:13:20] CloudyHS: well i guess for me it depends, would they put wow items on the steam marketplace? if they do that then im totally against it, like instead of the AH they can be posted on the marketplace for steam credits like CSGO skins
[1:13:23] physalis4: WoW won't go ftp...the subs are a huge cash cow
[1:13:24] CloudyHS: if they do that im 100% against it
[1:13:35] theszoti: lot of games do that and it's super annoying imo
[1:13:40] CloudyHS: if they dont do that, then im ok with it
[1:13:42] CloudyHS: bigger audience
[1:13:48] physalis4: If you want WoW to go FTP I hope you're ok with more micro transactions
[1:13:50] jskillz777: u can buy platinum on steam
[1:13:54] Layliah79: i just worry if Wow ever lost it's sub based subscriptions then the quantity and quality of content would go down.
[1:14:26] Layliah79: imagine having to do a micro transaction for more bag space
[1:14:28] physalis4: Did you see the bundle that was as much as the game?!
[1:14:29] Thoreya: people pay, thats why they do it. its crazy
[1:14:32] Elrathir: 60 dollar shiny pony
[1:14:38] bojackhorseman2004: Wow freetoplay but a 60 dollar expansion everyyear, i be fine with that
[1:14:38] theszoti: thats more like macrotransactions lol
[1:14:40] jskillz777: i bought the portal bundle
[1:14:52] physalis4: I can't complain...I just dropped $40 on the new OW premium BP
[1:15:03] jskillz777: there was mount too
[1:15:16] Jelky55: Jelky55 is gifting 3 Tier 1 Subs to MrGM's community! They've gifted a total of 7 in the channel! 
[1:15:16] jskillz777: i thought the mount was pretty ugly
[1:15:16] Jelky55: Jelky55 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Mekael5000! 
[1:15:16] Jelky55: Jelky55 gifted a Tier 1 sub to monarcheh! 
[1:15:16] Jelky55: Jelky55 gifted a Tier 1 sub to TulanOnTwitch! 
[1:15:21] Jelky55: u had 287 subs, i had to round it to 290
[1:15:36] Jelky55: yw
[1:15:48] jskillz777: no i didnt buy it
[1:16:14] S3N71: It's so nice out, I may fire up the BBQ this evening :)
[1:16:19] Elrathir: I heard someone say "If I paid 60 dollars for a mount, I'd expect to ride Lilith herself into battle"
[1:16:25] bojackhorseman2004: 10k on steam or overall?
[1:16:26] theszoti: lot of people play on battle.net too
[1:16:28] bojackhorseman2004: i am guessing steam
[1:16:36] Xolido: @MrGM What level on retail do u think is enough to farm TBC Kara - i really want the mount and the gun from Opera !?
[1:17:00] Xolido: ok thanks
[1:17:06] bojackhorseman2004: D4 is a monetary success. I am just waiting until the content is there
[1:17:27] bojackhorseman2004: The campaign was good
[1:17:38] bojackhorseman2004: but i play Argps for the endgame
[1:17:59] bojackhorseman2004: I play Bg3 for the story
[1:18:27] bojackhorseman2004: You really should
[1:18:49] jskillz777: its more of a dnd clone
[1:18:50] Annathebanana1986: I've been playing Tomb raider remastered, damn it's so fucking stressful, how the hell did complete them in my teenage years LUL
[1:18:56] bojackhorseman2004: PoE is peak dopamin mechanics endgame
[1:19:01] bojackhorseman2004: and Bg3 is peak rpg story telling
[1:19:38] Xolido: i regret so badly buying D4
[1:19:40] CloudyHS: this is a scalding hot take but in terms of RPGs bg3 is pretty average
[1:19:45] Annathebanana1986: Naa, I'm too busy watching her boob wobble LUL
[1:20:22] S3N71: The BG3 turn based combat takes a little of getting used to after WoW, SWTOR, etc., but the storyline is awesome
[1:20:23] jskillz777: digimon are the champions
[1:20:34] Digiimon: TRUE
[1:20:45] Annathebanana1986: LUL LUL
[1:21:18] Digiimon: Digiimon subscribed with Prime. 
[1:21:29] CloudyHS: how do you think reputations that are hated going to work once they make them account wide, like bloodsail. might be annoying if you wanna work on the goblin rep on one character and bloodsail on the other
[1:21:31] CloudyHS: since theyre opposite
[1:21:50] lunarae_star: lunarae_star subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! 
[1:22:14] S3N71: I'd recommend running the event in a party when you do
[1:22:21] lunarae_star: Doing well, yes thank you!
[1:22:34] CloudyHS: lol, makes sense
[1:23:08] lunarae_star: How are things with you @MrGM ?
[1:23:13] Volryn: true
[1:23:21] CloudyHS: have they clarified how reputation sources will work in account wide? like if you do X quest for 200 rep, will your alts just not get rep?
[1:23:26] CloudyHS: exactly yea
[1:23:35] lunarae_star: I'm so much looking forward to the War Within
[1:23:57] Layliah79: account wide rep gains - but limits to weekly amount of rep gained?
[1:24:05] Layliah79: people would complain lol
[1:24:15] CloudyHS: well that itself creates some issues, what if theres a recipe at renown 10 you want, but your alt has the profession the recipe is for
[1:24:27] lunarae_star: For sure @Layliah79
[1:24:36] S3N71: I like that at Exalted, you get tokens you can send to alts
[1:24:39] Layliah79: You get to try to break it when Alpha comes out!
[1:25:12] CloudyHS: so like, if ur 2x gathering on ur main, but theres a recipe for a tailoring at renown 10, youd have to get max renown for ur alt to use that recipe
[1:25:29] Volryn: or just make the items account bound
[1:25:30] Jelky55: when alpha is out, lets report is as "feedback"
[1:25:36] Volryn: then mail to alts
[1:25:37] coversRbetter: didnt they have that in sl? couldnt you buy an item that put you on like 40 renown?
[1:25:39] Jelky55: thats why testing is there
[1:25:43] Lausten: I'd rather they dont make it token based, having to track which of your 59 alts have exalted or not is an unnessesary hazzle
[1:25:46] Layliah79: honestly Rep on alts has been so easy to get this expansion.
[1:26:16] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[1:26:21] CloudyHS: i think one of the sleeper most important features is cross server guilds. wow is at its best when playing with friends, and this opens the door for SO many more people to be able to play in guilds
[1:26:33] mcloveinu716: feed ur pet
[1:26:53] CloudyHS: damn i got an ad right as i sent that message
[1:27:46] dastago: yeah ngl when i'm not subbed i notice there are a lot more than other streams
[1:27:47] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[1:27:51] Jelky55: dont run ads, why would u earn anything
[1:27:53] Volryn: I noticed other channels I'm not subbed to seem to have a lot more ad breaks
[1:27:58] physalis4: Twitch recently changed how they do ads. There is an option to let them adjust ads
[1:28:01] CloudyHS: stop putting up ads and take that raid shadowlands sponsor
[1:28:13] Volryn: LUL
[1:28:25] Lausten: All unsubbed people get all my Turbo ads Kappa
[1:28:35] CloudyHS: its a meme cuz they give it to anybody with a camera and internet
[1:28:52] fooxytv: same, turbo users are causing more ads
[1:29:02] fooxytv: :D
[1:29:30] CloudyHS: for me the biggest thing is preroll ads, like when i load into a stream and i get 2 minutes of ads, i just close it out
[1:29:33] CloudyHS: im not waiting for that
[1:29:33] Lausten: Yeah the chat is so toxic that way
[1:29:37] mcloveinu716: yup
[1:29:38] Lausten: 100% coded into it

[1:29:55] lunarae_star: That's odd, I don't see ads
[1:30:02] dastago: weirdest thing for twitch for me is sometimes i get gifted subs for channels i've never even watched
[1:30:14] Annathebanana1986: I mean how else am I supposed to know a new burger at McDonald's is out if I don't watch the ads
[1:30:15] CloudyHS: any gifters KappaCool
[1:30:36] keyboardturner: Stare
[1:30:44] CloudyHS: keyboardturner Stare
[1:30:45] Annathebanana1986: Lasagne
[1:30:45] apollymae: i hate that sometimes you get the same ad 3 times in a row
[1:30:49] Annathebanana1986: Yummmyy
[1:30:52] Lausten: The number of times I've seen first message of the day people write "ad" right after their first chat I would be a millionaire Kappa
[1:30:54] SlithTheSivak: subway now has footlong cookies
[1:31:11] CloudyHS: youd be shot dead in the streets of italy if you were seen eating that
[1:31:13] dastago: have you seen they've done a creme egg cookie too
[1:31:18] SlithTheSivak: subway also has churros!
[1:31:39] Annathebanana1986: Oh, I didn't know about the carbonara one mrgmPOG
[1:31:41] CloudyHS: does subway in UK have sausage rolls
[1:31:56] dastago: we got the pigs in blankets at subway over christmas tbf
[1:31:56] lunarae_star: lunarae_star gifted a Tier 1 sub to CloudyHS! They have given 6 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:31:57] SlithTheSivak: missed opportunity
[1:31:59] S3N71: I am leaning more and towards Twitch Turbo as a means to dip in and out of streamers who get raided by the streamers I support, as I get no ads, but they get the avenue
[1:32:11] lunarae_star: There you go @CloudyHS
[1:32:17] CloudyHS: @lunarae_star EZ thanks boss
[1:32:31] fooxytv: 11.99
[1:32:34] keyboardturner: i have never heard of twitch turbo
[1:32:38] lunarae_star: @CloudyHS  Hee
[1:32:50] S3N71: Aye
[1:32:57] fooxytv: it was around 8.99 before they put the price up
[1:33:00] CloudyHS: given the state of services whenever i see a new subscription service im just against it, theres so many subscription services thrown in ur face
[1:33:41] CloudyHS: yeah bro no offense you could be tweeting the secrets to immortality and i wouldnt sub to ur twitter
[1:34:10] Lausten: I hang out in so many wow, hearthstone and counter strike tournament streams that I would be broke if I were to sub to everyone.. #Turbo is the only way I can afford to support with the inflatrion at the moment..
[1:34:12] SlithTheSivak: these subway cookies are f'ing rediculous
[1:34:26] CloudyHS: LOL
[1:34:29] keyboardturner: i would maybe pay for a sub if they gave me actual features like custom emojis to use
[1:35:01] CloudyHS: each tier of twitter sub unlocks 2 digits of the persons social security number
[1:35:05] CloudyHS: 50 dollars for the whole number

[2:32:45] Dunkurk: Gutten morgen
[2:32:58] S3N71: I'm not convinced I completed it first time round as never has the bag space
[2:32:58] Dunkurk: Degeneracy has taking me
[2:33:25] Dunkurk: I finished workk at 4am yesterday, rolled a new warrior on sod and hit 25 at 6am this morning
[2:33:37] S3N71: I enjoyed it tbh
[2:33:38] Jelky55: i havent actually checked it
[2:34:12] Jelky55: are we witnessing MrGM reacting to MrGM?
[2:34:35] S3N71: It popped up on my phone when I was a coffee, so watched it.  Coffee and shorts work, confirmed
[2:34:44] michaelmm: I like your delivery in that - it's super punchy!

[2:38:52] Dunkurk: Remember to check th BB AH for them aswell
[2:38:57] Lausten: Cause BB AH may have them while this one doesnt
[2:40:08] Dunkurk: I think its just percieved rarity, they alll have the same drop rate from the same mobs im sure
[2:40:14] Lausten: Some of them are probably lower drop rates, would make sense with Blizzard
[2:41:39] Dunkurk: workk out what the xp per golld on the crates is cause you dont need th erep
[2:41:55] Dunkurk: There's an addon that tells you how much each crate turns in for
[2:42:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[2:42:37] Dunkurk: Theres nothing at reveard or exalted yet

[2:47:15] Iwony: yeah also still don't have it I slowly begin to think it is as rare as the manuscript
[2:47:20] S3N71: One day for me, off to London tomorrow, so hopefully Sunday
[2:47:20] Iwony: as the mount
[2:47:59] Lausten: You'll get less XP the higher level you get
[2:48:18] Dunkurk: the guide might be waiting to see what xp you are at to see if it needs to have a grind step before handing in
[2:48:37] apollymae: probably continuation so youre not running around everywhere
[2:49:41] Lausten: The color of the quest determines the XP, but also your level, I think wowhead even have a slider for the XP depending on what level you are

[2:58:09] Zuldak: I have fond memories of old thousand needles as horde
[2:58:16] Calfast: Oh god Helcular's Rod
[2:58:38] Dunkurk: Its a low drop rate quest item from the yetis that turns in to the alliance graveyard which has the guards in it, great design
[2:58:39] Zuldak: @Dunkurk you've unlocked some cursed memories... damn yetis
[2:58:59] michaelmm: LUL Blanked out the memory!
[2:59:22] Dunkurk: @Zuldak I did it 2 days ago on my shaman it's even worse when the cave is full of alliance on a pvp realm
[2:59:37] Zuldak: well that's on you for playing on pvp realm
[3:01:09] kickdbucket: Dan is a closet horde player :P
[3:01:16] Dunkurk: I did a warrior to 60 at classic launch and was intent on being DPS, so of course i wound up as the Main Tank through MC and BWL
[3:02:04] Dunkurk: I picked the warrior then for one reasion, i played the long game and wanted TBC classic from day one to get stormhearld
[3:02:20] Dunkurk: damn tootin i did
[3:02:32] itsDets: hello @MrGM just got back to wow after 1-2 months break and noticed something... did they say something about a change from "Blizzard account bound" to just "Account bound" or "Binds to account" on items?
[3:02:32] Dunkurk: stormhearld and lionheart executioner
[3:02:38] Dunkurk: ARMS gang
[3:03:27] Dunkurk: I picked the whirlwind hammer just to trigger kexman
[3:04:00] NIICKLAS_TV: doing fantastic mrgmPOG how are you?
[3:04:23] itsDets: oh I see thought it has maybe something to do with the speculation about WoW coming to Steam

[3:05:44] Calfast: Next year needs to be bigger obviously
[3:05:45] OrthiadNick: I saw that melee hunter is doing pretty well in SOD, are you going to try it?
[3:05:55] Dunkurk: really weird thing i noticed leveling up last night, when you turn in waylaid supplies it consumes rested, normally quests push the rested bar along but not these

[3:13:49] Madve: U can have 3, but one has to be gathering, or something
[3:13:51] Dunkurk: I dont see any harm in retail letting you have them all, since they all end up usless by the end of an expansion apart from enchanting
[3:13:58] Prycey: I would love if they did what FF14 does, just let us have every profession on 1 character
[3:14:50] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:15:21] Sindragozer: enchanting has an item that gives 20 spellpower for 30 mins, on a 30 min cd. and alchemy has combat potions now that give 35 spellpower for 20 sec on 2 min cd

[3:16:58] Larkaro: 10.2.6 is a myth and its just going to be ALPHA
[3:17:35] yuldovah42: 10.2.6 is an April fools day patch
[3:17:35] Samiccus: Prepatch in early summer so that makes sense
[3:18:02] Samiccus: whats up my man @MrGM
[3:18:04] Prycey: fated for 5-6months is gonna be so boring
[3:18:09] Samiccus: i dont remember either
[3:18:39] Zuldak: I just want my duck mount
[3:18:43] Prycey: DF raids and all 10 DF dungeons it's gonna be bad
[3:18:46] Larkaro: fated raids but its all the final raids from each expansion
[3:18:51] michaelmm: They usually have an off season with the rewards carrying on but the 0.1% and PvP titles end when the pre-patch drops
[3:19:45] Dunkurk: I go into each expansion with the intention of getting KSM, stil never done it
[3:20:05] mikeygames: from memory Dan zygor wants you to do that for a quest in searing gorge that you'll never do this phase
[3:20:09] mikeygames: so just do what you want with the silk

[3:23:27] Samiccus: no release just a tease
[3:23:34] FloberSF: Thats why you listen to trance more often
[3:23:45] Dunkurk: It's ironically named best drops ever
[3:23:49] Dunkurk: some of them are unhinged
[3:24:12] Madve: What are some rewards u can get from follower dungeons then? other than just gear
[3:24:17] Dunkurk: It's like drop from a banging donk to nicklebackk
[3:25:11] Prycey: raiding in vault and ninjaing the necks just for a mount was funny LUL
[3:25:19] keyboardturner: it's the classic experience
[3:26:22] mikeygames: imagine being the only person back in 2005 with zygor LUL
[3:26:30] mikeygames: you'd be a legend
[3:27:26] Sindragozer: love is in the air is over :(
[3:27:36] Dunkurk: think its a SoD specific quest if its tagged seasonal
[3:27:51] Sindragozer: i thought i had more time and i didnt finish.
[3:27:59] Sindragozer: no seasonal is the holiday stuff
[3:28:15] Sindragozer: you could get candy boxes that give really good buffs
[3:28:30] Sindragozer: 23 spellpower
[3:28:33] Sindragozer: 2 percent hit
[3:29:18] Dunkurk: There was probably some idea that having one a time would encourage you to break up leveling to go get the chest done and turned in as something different to do
[3:29:26] Dunkurk: in reality youu just deleted ones you wherent gona do

[3:29:58] Dunkurk: I dont even thing the limit of 12 is needed either
[3:30:06] Dunkurk: unlimit them and let the filled crates stack
[3:30:38] mikeygames: some of the new ones are bugged I think as they class as 'low level' when turning in
[3:31:21] Sery_Bot: A 90 second ad break is starting! Thank you for sticking with us through this break! seryboLove Ads help support my content. Consider subscribing to remove ads and support the stream!
[3:32:15] Dunkurk: its something like 3 days
[3:32:34] Prycey: someone did it in 36hours
[3:32:43] mikeygames: 21 hours 16 mins according to reddit and a youtube video for evidence
[3:32:52] Sery_Bot: The ad break is finishing now! seryboLove
[3:32:53] fooxytv: I'm still 25
[3:33:52] mikeygames: the 21 hour record was suppported by other players killing mobs, the proper record is 36 hours 12 mins on wowhead
[3:34:14] mikeygames: wow 1-25 took 4 hours according to article
[3:34:22] Prycey: I think the fact on retail you can lvl from 1-70 in under 4hours is mental
[3:35:14] mikeygames: are we getting flying at level 10 in war within? since Dragonflight will be the default leveling experience the new players?
[3:35:17] yuldovah42: skip
[3:36:26] mikeygames: how many unused maps are there? I'd be interested in that video
[3:36:46] Dunkurk: I was so confused there, i used the ingame wow timer to set a timer for my air fryer that just blasted "CHIPS" on my screen, turns out the alarm repeats if you leave it
[3:36:48] S3N71: I wish we had dragon flying from the moment we unlocked flying in Retail
[3:37:18] Sindragozer: more ass you say?
[3:37:49] Dunkurk: You ever see the kara map thats in vanillas files
[3:38:15] yuldovah42: what about the zone behind stratholme
[3:38:44] Dunkurk: theres also the island with the big squid temple thing in the alpha files
[3:38:48] keyboardturner: what do you bet the lvl50 raid will be? I notice they're choosing raids with relatively small-ish (7/8) bosses, which works for RFD / Uldaman / Zul'Farrak
[3:38:55] yuldovah42: there a secret area that hasnt been devoleped in side the zone
[3:39:06] mikeygames: Sunken Temple! imo
[3:39:26] keyboardturner: Sunken Temple is an immense amount of bosses, idk if people will do it
[3:39:36] Dunkurk: Theres nothing saying they have to only do 1 level up raid at 50
[3:39:49] mikeygames: @keyboardturner full blackrock depths then ha
[3:40:12] Dunkurk: nono nothing saying they only have to do one level up
[3:40:19] Dunkurk: they could do 2
[3:40:39] keyboardturner: it's joever
[3:41:46] Prycey: I like that they made evoker Soar have dragon flying it's really cool
[3:41:49] keyboardturner: Maraudon is a little bit longer but also a possibility
[3:41:52] Dunkurk: 21 bosses
[3:42:15] keyboardturner: it should still be there I think
[3:42:15] GaryNec: Yes and its been remopved
[3:42:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[3:42:18] GaryNec: Removedc
[3:42:22] Dunkurk: Technically 27 if you count the differnet bosses than can spawn at ring of law
[3:43:05] keyboardturner: i have a working version
[3:44:03] keyboardturner: i don't think it was above? what
[3:44:07] GaryNec: Ye thats where it used to be
[3:44:20] Big_Rum: Hello There!
[3:44:32] keyboardturner: are you talking about the floating rocks and domes? that was north of deadmines area, not above
[3:44:42] Big_Rum: I just woke up this flu is thepits
[3:46:49] keyboardturner: southwest not north oops. but it's still there

[3:51:00] funviking99: bots
[3:51:01] mikeygames: bots prob
[3:51:03] Dunkurk: SUS
[3:51:04] keyboardturner: uhoh
[3:51:13] Zulef: ofc theyre bots
[3:51:13] unleashyourbless: Yeah, probs bots.
[3:51:49] keyboardturner: they're spewing "boost" trade chat psam
[3:51:50] xmalthael02: Same for 0rg
[3:51:58] yuldovah42: yes also in org
[3:51:59] xmalthael02: Yup
[3:52:03] mikeygames: set yourself as a guide and go into the south bank in stormwind... enjoy the murloc headed bots
[3:52:04] Dunkurk: Whilst your in swamp remember to go slap a couple of green whelps and see if the pet drops
[3:52:21] unleashyourbless: Haven't noticed any on my server, really. But I play on an RP server.
[3:52:22] keyboardturner: able to go to stormwind immediately, don't need to do an intro, unlocked immediately unlike allied races
[3:52:35] keyboardturner: almost instant red flag that the message is a scam
[3:52:39] mikeygames: hundeds all stacked on top in stormwind bank
[3:52:44] Dunkurk: Any time i was doing ST in classic i made sure to swing by the whelps on route and kill a couple
[3:52:57] michaelmm: Everytime I pass through Shattrath there's a bunch hanging out there.
[3:53:20] Zulef: Zaralek Caverns in retail is full of gather bots too
[3:53:35] keyboardturner: every month or so blizz does a banwave on all the boost spammers btw, the key is to report the lvl1 spammers. it's actually against ToS to advertise cross server
[3:53:36] mikeygames: probably skinning and vendoring everything
[3:53:38] funviking99: farming gold I think
[3:54:24] mikeygames: suppose if a bow of searing arrows of 500g+ ha
[3:54:31] Thoreya: for gdkp
[3:54:39] Samiccus: They banned GDKP
[3:54:59] keyboardturner: apparently they've been testing bot banning tech in retail and classic for a little while and are prepping to fully implement it in full force soon
[3:55:01] Thoreya: i meant the new tech was for specifically gdkp
[3:55:03] Dunkurk: Theres a bunch of people complaing they got banned by the GDKP protection for traidng gold from retail for calssic gold
[3:55:03] michaelmm: There's still dsicords doing GDKP.
[3:55:05] mikeygames: "hey mage, can you conjure me some water please? here's 2000g"
[3:55:27] Samiccus: GDKP black market lol
[3:56:55] Dunkurk: I've always hated GDKP, bring back regular DKP
[3:56:59] michaelmm: They set up a discord to do xserver arbitrage to get around the GDKP ban - but the server has had to pause and folks using it were still getting banned LUL
[3:57:14] unleashyourbless: Used to watch a content creator who did GDKPs all the time, but once they were banned, he did a 180 and said he always hated them. Like bro, what? lol
[3:58:13] mrsrockguru: Just started a nelf priest on Lava Lash any chance of an invite into the guild @MrGM
[3:58:44] michaelmm: There's a tonne of folks saying they got banned just for "innocently" trading gold. LUL
[3:58:55] mrsrockguru: nps which one are you on. I have a priest on wild growth as well
[3:59:04] keyboardturner: unless somebody gets mass reported i almost never believe the "i got banned for nothing!"
[3:59:27] Layliah79: lol
[3:59:43] michaelmm: I always love it when someone on the forums pushes the forum CM's too hard about it and they share why that person got their ban. LUL
[3:59:52] Sindragozer: nah, i got permad for nothing once. it took a couple weeks but it got over turned
[4:00:02] Dunkurk: You know what i love, the old school runescape dev mod Ash, replys to ban appearls on twitter occasionally and posts log sand everything being like "Yeah you where legitimatly banned"
[4:00:07] Samiccus: Oh ya i did tell him i was going to pound his mom my bad....
[4:00:40] keyboardturner: it would be kinda funny if we could see public ban logs
[4:00:44] funviking99: @samiccus hello there
[4:00:50] unleashyourbless: That quest can take ages
[4:00:58] mrsrockguru: Yep I have a nelf priest lvl 8 on wild growth, again any chance of a guild invite, toon name is Leyanyar
[4:01:07] michaelmm: They usually shut the "I didn't do it guv" threads pretty fast by very occasionally they will react if someone dosn't take no for an answer.
[4:01:29] Dunkurk: people think blizzards logs are dumb, you can searcah the logs for every key stroke a persons ever made in the game all the way back to account creation
[4:01:46] StreamElements: Isle of Dorn Zone Preview - The War Within (Pre-Alpha) | #worldofwarcraft #warcraft #gaming #shorts - https://youtu.be/bCyGbTUz7Is
[4:02:00] bomayaa: was that the one called I played all of it a lot or something?
[4:02:24] Dunkurk: When i temped at blizz for legion launch i loved digging into ban appeals
[4:02:45] bomayaa: I just saw the title but had no idea who he was so ignored it
[4:03:32] keyboardturner: I wish we kinda just had a "completion order" story mode
[4:03:39] Dunkurk: j1mmy has a lot of good video essay type videos on RS aswell
[4:04:15] Dunkurk: his bt releases series is gigga
[4:04:26] Dunkurk: he plays every bit of content in OSRS in ordert it was released
[4:04:31] keyboardturner: even dragonflight has the issue, there's nothing indicating what quests come first to complete them in chronological order
[4:04:41] keyboardturner: you get 10.1/10.2 all shoved at you at the same time
[4:05:11] Manthieus: This is strong Dejavu. Was killing these whelps just hours ago.
[4:05:23] keyboardturner: lot of people missed the dawn of the infinite story because they had to rush throguh the dungeon
[4:05:31] keyboardturner: same for the 10.1 raid frankly
[4:05:55] bomayaa: I find that with all dungeons which is why I love followed dungeons
[4:05:59] keyboardturner: well even LFR you're pressured to just rush through or get kicked
[4:06:45] heavenfall91: !zygor
[4:06:45] StreamElements: I am using Zygor for my in-game Guides! You can get 20% off Zygor when you use the code "MrGM" and use my link https://zygorguides.com/ref/MrGM/

[4:08:53] fooxytv: I'd like that, I played a custom server which had bots in raids
[4:08:58] fooxytv: you could play single player
[4:09:15] keyboardturner: frankly i think having the follower bots to replace LFR would be nice

[4:09:49] LuiBMHunter: but half the fun of lfr is the idiots in there
[4:10:04] LuiBMHunter: yeah!
[4:10:10] keyboardturner: ffxiv has the same feature for raids and dungeons and has no issues with their population
[4:10:17] Lausten: I think thats the idea, its techinically a continuation of the Exiles Reach experience..
[4:10:18] Samiccus: the "wow is dead" guys are always in the comment section lol
[4:10:28] fooxytv: nope, being told every 5 minutes "you are doing it wrong, kick the tank!"
[4:10:54] keyboardturner: frankly the follower dungeons in ff make it immensely more inviting to actually learn the mechanics too
[4:11:16] keyboardturner: you don't feel like you're wasting anyone's time if you mess up
[4:11:17] LuiBMHunter: 19 bots one player in lfr - you wouldn't learn anything - you could just afk the whole thing
[4:11:27] Dunkurk: I use the follower dungeons in FF to learn fights, you watch what the NPC move for since they are pre scripted to move out of the bad before it appears
[4:11:35] keyboardturner: mostly yeah, some people do it in private still
[4:12:15] StreamElements: dracJAM TWITCH PRIME dracJAM
[4:13:04] Squiggle10: Do you plan to raid Gnomergan? It's really good fun as a 10 man
[4:14:11] Dunkurk: farming that gold
[4:14:16] Lausten: Did you ever find your sleeping bag?
[4:14:19] S3N71: Probably for gold
[4:14:26] Dunkurk: I've used rested xp
[4:14:32] S3N71: Not yet, but I will get Zygor
[4:14:47] fooxytv: Joana's Guides is good also :)
[4:14:48] unleashyourbless: I've used both RXP and Zygor
[4:15:01] spezzj: wow devs have been so calm latetly, hoping they're cooking something good :p
[4:15:03] Dunkurk: yeah rested put out SoD specific guides
[4:15:06] keyboardturner: closest thing to a guide i use is questie just to see quest objective locations in classic, otherwise nothing like RXP/zygor
[4:15:09] Dunkurk: it includes runes along the way
[4:15:13] unleashyourbless: I like RXP for Classic, Zygor for retail
[4:15:17] Squiggle10: Most 40s there are likely farming "Heart of the wild". They're used for new Tailoring recipes and sell for a lot of gold
[4:15:42] Lausten: Never used any guides for leveling, I only use guides for collecting, secrets and such, and usually its just wowhead guides on the third monitor :D
[4:15:57] Squiggle10: They drop from the plant monsters. Can't remember the name of the mobs haha
[4:16:00] fooxytv: 3rd monitor??
[4:16:15] unleashyourbless: I like Zygor the most, though, because it has stuff for achievements, profession leveling, etc.
[4:16:21] unleashyourbless: At least in retail
[4:16:21] Dunkurk: Wowhead is 4th monitor content for me
[4:16:22] fooxytv: discord monitor :D
[4:16:28] Lausten: Yeah same, I got a horisontal monitor
[4:16:35] Lausten: Vertical*
[4:17:08] fooxytv: MrGM on the main monitor for me
[4:17:11] fooxytv: ^^
[4:17:15] breninn3: Have you seen those square monitors people are using for streaming
[4:17:42] Dunkurk: You don't think you need an extra monitor until you get it then you think "how did i live without this" and the cycle repeats up to about 8 at 8 monitors your FOV is full
[4:17:51] Lausten: Sometimes I feel like I need a 4th, but I'd rather get a bigger one so I can scale stuff instead
[4:17:59] Forgiven78: I have you on 1/2 my 49 monitor and work on the other half.
[4:18:28] fooxytv: need you in the car
[4:18:50] FlutterBaby: that's me while i grind out old content for xp and achieves lol
[4:19:06] breninn3: Not the Elgato, LG DualUp is one, 16:18 Aspect Ratio on a 27 inch monitor
[4:19:23] unleashyourbless: See? You said the drop rate was good and you jinxed it lol
[4:19:54] Dunkurk: Oh the quare one
[4:19:59] Dunkurk: square*
[4:20:03] Lausten: That sounds like the tihing I would need for my third monitor
[4:20:37] Dunkurk: The prompter would be great for like IRL streams seeing chat
[4:20:45] BBMezzy: I want the prompter but don't really have the proper space for it on my desk
[4:20:55] Dunkurk: as a setup with a seperate cameraman anyway
[4:21:14] Lausten: A vertical 24" for Discord is cool, but you all of a sudden need another monitor for a website, thats where a monitor like that would be cool
[4:21:46] Lausten: But damn, was it 600?
[4:21:53] neverbornlucky: MrGm did you see in florida where the cop thought he was under fire but turned out a squirrell dropped a acorn on his cop car and he started shooting
[4:22:18] breninn3: So anyway I started blasting
[4:22:38] Lausten: I was just thinking that
[4:22:39] neverbornlucky: yes
[4:22:48] keyboardturner: KKona
[4:23:03] S3N71: Squirrels are still classed as vermin in some parts of the UK and fall in to the kill on sight category
[4:23:24] bwoods79: Excited for your house viewing? Maybe its everything youve been looking for.
[4:23:37] breninn3: Especially Grey Squirrels, they're non-native and killing all the red ones
[4:24:33] bwoods79: Maybe he was busy playing SoD
[4:24:48] BBMezzy: Is it the house you were talking about earlier this week? The one down the street?
[4:24:54] Lausten: Everytime I hear something like a cop shooting like that I think of that cartoon clip from Bowling for Columbine.. "A Brief History of the United States" LUL

[4:30:01] Lausten: Jailbreak, best quest of vanilla wow..
[4:30:09] breninn3: Would love to see WoW get included with GamesPass. I think they'll remove the expansion costs and keep the sub
[4:30:19] neverbornlucky: Last Epoch is so much fun btw
[4:30:26] FinkTV: @MrGM hope all is well brotha!
[4:30:41] Lausten: Yeah.. I got chills when I played that questline when classic came out, so much nostalgia
[4:30:43] FinkTV: doing well thanks for asking!
[4:31:12] Dunkurk: I still think they'll let you have up to dragonflight with game pass then youll need to buy war within and a sub to play passed that
[4:31:18] Lausten: Walking through Stormwind to expose Lady Katrina Prestor as Onxyia..
[4:33:14] neverbornlucky: MrGm doesn't need a computer he's getting MSI Claw
[4:33:23] Dunkurk: so you can do the winterspring turn in quest at level 58, meaning you could technically just farm winterspring rep to go from 58-60
[4:33:42] michaelmm: Wow's probably a better candidate for cloud gaming than a FPS is latency wise.
[4:33:51] neverbornlucky: yep first non  valve handheld with Steamos and windows
[4:33:54] Lausten: Wasnt it dailys at one point?
[4:33:57] Dunkurk: If you intended to get the mount anyway may aswell level at the same time
[4:33:59] S3N71: MSI Claw is a gaming handheld
[4:34:35] neverbornlucky: legion is windows
[4:35:18] S3N71: There was the Windows phone, had one for a while, the OS was okay
[4:35:39] Lausten: I got a Microsoft Surface Pro, its fine, but its faaaar from a tablet..
[4:35:41] neverbornlucky: I think legion is the one that has detachable controllers like switch
[4:36:22] S3N71: @Lausten I've a had a couple of Surface tablets.  Sadly, fairly recently, last one was stolen :*(
[4:36:55] Lausten: Yeah thats how the Surface Pro works, detachable keyboard
[4:37:37] S3N71: I've a HP Spectre, which has a touch screen and the screen can be folded back 180 degrees too.  But I had to pay for the stylus separately
[4:37:44] Lausten: @S3N71 I bought mine for school, only 120GB, BIGGEST regret ever, way too small
[4:38:31] Lausten: Aint that how the Surface Laptop works as well @S3N71 ?
[4:38:47] S3N71: @lausten I had the Surface Pro 7 - i7, and I think a 512 SSD
[4:39:17] S3N71: @Lausten Poss, never had the Surface laptop
[4:40:39] S3N71: Shimmering flats, another turtle graveyard ;-)
[4:41:10] S3N71: Just made my hunter a 14 slot quiver :)
