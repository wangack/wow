[1:00:51] NewWorldReign: did they slow down mount speed in shadowlands area?
[1:00:54] Qazroth: where do you rank this expansion amongst the others?
[1:02:02] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee Good morning, sir. Got my Hunter to 173 ilvl and am 3/10 LFR Nathria. Got another Legendary Power from Altimor, and got two pieces of 187 gear from another Hunter.
[1:02:17] bec0o: there is nothing to do
[1:02:27] Qazroth: damn, glad I didn't come back for this one then
[1:02:28] CritcobainTV: Grey Kreygasm
[1:02:30] MrGattz: there is plenty to do.. it just feels like work.
[1:02:36] Vadagar1: Hey at least its much better than BFA
[1:02:38] Magaruis: Whats that addon to send out troops ?
[1:02:53] CritcobainTV: @KKazroth I've enjoyed it for sure, if you enjoy pvp there's a lot more to do. But i've had WAY more fun than BFA
[1:03:06] pavepawns: damn the new torghast follower is insane
[1:03:09] MrGattz: i dont want to grind anima for 10 hours for 1000 when you need 5000 to upgrade something. takes way to much time for no return
[1:03:11] Angerina: I just keep leveling alts
[1:03:17] Angerina: it's fun for that
[1:03:28] Flufflol: It honestly feels just like bfa minus the endless grind, so that makes it wod basically.
[1:03:36] Moiste: so right now you think overall this is a pretty bad expansion?
[1:03:54] MrGattz: @Moiste its the xpac with the most potential that isnt utilized
[1:04:07] MrGattz: so its not wod bad, its just not finished.
[1:04:26] NewWorldReign: it needs more work before we can rate this expansion

[1:04:31] lolyouwildwyd: @Towelliee what xpac didnt need a lot of work man? it's all systems that never carry over and just add so much needless bloat lol
[1:04:39] pavepawns: i would love wod tier raids tho this expac
[1:05:40] xrandomdoodx: the PVE gearing bottlenecks you too much compared to PVP, so it's def understandable that people enjoy it less who don't enjoy PVP

[1:09:08] SlayerLightStorm: @Towelliee I also got the Arboreal Gulper yesterday in Ardenweald. It's one of the few 100% drop rate mounts in the game, but here's the real kicker: I outran a Demon Hunter on the way to the rare, and they called for a nerf to Trailblazer. LUL I was like, "I'm fast as fuck boi" and just took off like Sonic the Hedgehog after he goes Super Sonic in Sonic 3 and Knuckles.
[1:09:48] mo197: cool good work....I saw a little on Lux's channel

[2:21:27] Ithylz: All the info will be dropped at Blizzconline for sure. Waiting for big juicy news
[2:21:29] Sandman_88: Feb 2 and 5th

[2:22:18] warrenny: @mekchopperdiaries Because even if it was perfect ppl would still whine
[2:22:23] Gapz: @Towelliee But was not a core thing about this expac: do weekly stuff rather than daily as oposed to Legion and BFA?

[2:22:32] toobaked1987: @Towelliee do you think we are at a WoD state currently in Shadowlands?
[2:22:33] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[2:22:35] mansohi: @mekchopperdiaries because world changes?
[2:22:47] Cosmolus: twisted corridors was announced as the mage tower 2.0. That's the problem
[2:22:53] jbeastb: Maw and tower is a bust
[2:22:59] Affiiance: The Maw is so bad
[2:23:02] PrimalRain: I had high hopes for twisting corridors. wanted cosmetics and such from it. it was meh
[2:23:04] Cosmolus: and the rewards are discusting
[2:23:10] lanara233: @warrenny , @mansohi fair enough
[2:23:10] xXSiebzehnXx: Yeah 5 masks visions lasted longer than 8 floors of Tc
[2:23:17] Flufflol: twisting corridors would have been amazing if it had like cosmetics and shit every layer and every last floor honestly, it was a dissapointment.
[2:23:29] Ithylz: They are fine in essence tbh but are lacking replayability
[2:23:34] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee was the Mage tower more challenging?
[2:23:37] propoopimus: everyone said visions 2.0, all streamers were like "NO IT'S AWESOME' yea horse shit
[2:23:37] Korupcija_: Ion has to god
[2:23:39] aPorkpie: Cosmetic rewards. being one mount and one tmog
[2:23:39] Korupcija_: go*
[2:23:41] Immanis: oh snap! different hammer colors?!
[2:23:42] KingSlayerYotam: the 72 floors torgasht seemed so much fun on beta
[2:23:43] RodneyIsPro: i like the maw in a group and 2 sides a week is fun suuuuperrr ez tho
[2:24:02] toobaked1987: No one wants to go to the maw. Why would I want to spend 16 hours in Twisiting for a mount that represents a place I hate going in the first place
[2:24:09] Cosmolus: i can't clear layer 6 on my ret
[2:24:18] XuremGaming: Torghast would be better if the powers were more fun for all specs and it had better/more rewards
[2:24:41] warrenny: @enryu_mazino Thats why i hroup it tried l1 as ret then realised group
[2:24:44] snipsfan: the maw just daily grind for stygia.. and the items people want cost way to much stygia IMO. 7200 per socket and 1900 for a random conduit upgrade most likely lands on wrong spec. gah
[2:25:00] Cosmolus: i always get the mawsworn floors and when i get to 14+ floors they 1 shot me
[2:25:02] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee a lot of player have still not completed all the Twisting corridors. why do you all always make the same mistake comparing streamers who play all day every day to the millions of wow players who dont
[2:25:03] Tharia: mage tower was fun and challenging with decent rewards. maw is just boring all around
[2:25:17] Affiiance: I dont even want to go in and do the 30 minutes it takes to get Soul Ash anymore
[2:25:22] Lincoln_WoW: the pool of powers is not big enough
[2:25:44] Korupcija_: I'm afraid they will work on the maw and torghast but it will still suck
[2:25:47] korickss: so versatility is a better stat than mastery?
[2:25:49] KingSlayerYotam: it was bad yea
[2:25:56] fallchild6: yep didn't even use the hound
[2:26:03] Gapz: @Towelliee Thats because non-twisting corridos are just so damn easy
[2:26:11] chubbeh: shadehound was great for me because it tanked and I could just free cast
[2:26:14] PrimalRain: it really needs new anime and actual rewards outside of legendary stuff
[2:26:27] thegrinchdwarf: I agree. I don’t like the Shade Hound and I don’t feel like spending 3+ hours in The Twisting Cooridors and then fail at the end.
[2:26:44] jbeastb: the whole thing is a complete bust. Visually boring. Mechnically boring. Little to no rewards. And worst of all? Mandatory.
[2:26:50] xXSiebzehnXx: Sick wall breaks @towelliee
[2:26:55] Korupcija_: were shadehounds only active that week?
[2:27:23] FranciscoTheMage: The question is .. why didn't they think us players wanted rewards for doing such a repeat thing.. Torghast that is
[2:27:25] blazeofhell: is this bg or rgb?
[2:27:27] FranciscoTheMage: @Towelliee
[2:27:28] snipsfan: @jbeastb 100%
[2:27:30] xhrysalis: that's kotmogu for you
[2:27:46] Flufflol: I just hate the way they promoted it, back in beta they said that its the place you wanna be in if you care about cosmetics and all as far as i remember but so far this doesnt look anything like it.
[2:28:05] evenkind7620: what about the mounts we all voted on lol
[2:28:08] xhrysalis: people are too scared to jump into the pit for some reason
[2:28:33] PrimalRain: Flufflolz yep, it's what had me interested in it tbh
[2:28:52] propoopimus: Kreygasm

[2:42:50] mrniceguy817: As a casual who hates/refuses pvp gearing up is so bad alt at 200ilvl with a 171 helm
[2:42:56] Affiiance: Always insta Leave on Attack

[2:44:31] guesswhofoo: Hey towelliee ima say this while we all still here: i'm glad you're healthy and still here with us. My dickhead friend told me you died of corona this morning and i almost believed this fool. Glad you still streaming.
[2:44:35] CritcobainTV: You almost always lose WG when you're attacking. It's so much harder man
[2:45:04] othraerir: and campaign gear
[2:45:09] TheFuriyon: you can get a 197 through campaign and upgradign with anima
[2:45:14] ChaoticPriest: Odd. I think every time I've attacked in WG, I've won. I thought it was harder to win as defense tbh
[2:45:36] CritcobainTV: If i get into a WG when attacking i just afk out lol
[2:45:48] Thoreya: i mean u can literally just upgrade ur covnenat gear and do keysand u have the vault
[2:45:51] Thoreya: like ur gonna get geard
[2:45:56] mrniceguy817: Hmm I finished the campaign on my alt no helm though the 171 is the campaign helm though
[2:46:27] XuremGaming: Sitting at 198 but pvp has been pretty decent for me. Bought a lot of haste/vers gear on the DH
[2:46:28] piratechris: My mains are stuck on 195ish so I'm just leveling alts. Once Im done with that if nothing has changed its unsub and go play something else
[2:46:29] Armdel: defense is usually a free win
[2:46:40] jerexify: @Towelliee Can I get some good luck wishes? I have an interview coming up Monday for a pretty substantial promotion I'd really like to get... I'm fairly confident, but everything helps.
[2:46:44] fluh_: you can plug the covenant helm into the covenant gear upgrader and upgrade the ilvl with anima
[2:46:45] TheFuriyon: Wintergrasp is the most unbalanced BG
[2:46:47] fewyn: you have to be real bad to lose on defense
[2:46:50] blazeofhell: well, if blizz did something to loot rates for non-pvp players, we wouldn't be stuck at 200is ilvls. why can only PVP provide you with a reliable ways to upgrade gear but not PVE at current drop rates?

[2:46:55] Sparda_67: y wintergrasp is scuffed af
[2:46:57] CritcobainTV: @piratechris that's your fault tho. 195 you can easily upgrade from raids / mythic+
[2:47:00] NewWorldReign: defense is a HK booster compared to attacking
[2:47:15] kappaday23: Keepo

[2:48:35] Velashen: They need to fix it a bit. Not give out gear like candy again.
[2:48:36] blazeofhell: they have vendors in covenant sanctums that sell raid gear for some currency, I only got one of that currency during covenant campaing? where am I suppose to get the rest of those currencies?

[2:50:06] griffdog125: clearing heroic and doing a few mythic bosses a week and walking out with only 1 actual drop if lucky is aids
[2:50:18] Johnson_2004: @Towelliee I'm a ret pala ilvl 204, yet i'm always thinking that my dps is low. what advice do you have?
[2:50:24] Mortiie_: If they could stop listening to casuals who cant do tactics and Vanilla players blinded by nostalgia that'd be great lol.
[2:50:34] Ralvay: that is hard line for any MMO..
[2:50:36] stratiss: I think if raiding dropped more loot it would be fine
[2:50:38] Asonderr: @zeoxys then just go to another stream, simple
[2:50:39] CritcobainTV: @Zeoxys People complain / talk about gearing issues on the majority of PvE streams. Not really sure how this is "the only stream" that complains about it
[2:50:42] dengueuk: @Towelliee the past 2 week i have got nothing from raids 10/10 and got nothing from dungeons and 1 upgrade from weekly vault

[2:51:29] Waspire: i liked personal loot
[2:51:43] CritcobainTV: @Zeoxys Because people talk about it and the possible options for changing it? It's called conversation. Get over it, find somewhere else if you don't like the conversation
[2:51:45] Cabbageman007: Zeoxys what do you like about the loot nerf?
[2:51:49] Riggoz1: even if LFR had higher chance to drop loot would be better.. then casuals could atleast be around the 200

[2:52:32] CritcobainTV: everything was an upgrade at the start

[2:53:11] dyslexican1: dyslexican1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 20 month streak! 
[2:53:13] Zeoxys: and now we have it and people bitch bc they dont wanna do higher keys or whatever
[2:53:18] idenkaz_: let loot be loot. yeah fuk that nonesense.
[2:53:23] abbosss: who the fuck was crying for less loot @Zeoxys ?
[2:53:28] Cabbageman007: higher keys isnt more loot
[2:53:32] CritcobainTV: @Zeoxys the issue isn't that they don't want to. higher keys give shit ilvl gear KEKW
[2:53:34] Zeoxys: literally everyone
[2:53:41] abbosss: @Zeoxys dawg you probably dont even have KSM, gtfo
[2:53:43] roverrone: @Zeoxys ive seen maybe one person
[2:53:48] bmwhockey: loot feels good to get, its just horrible to be forced to pvp or as an m+ player or be fforced to do 15 keys as a raider etc
[2:53:50] JohnnyMacklin: @Zeoxys "literally" sandmanCRINGE
[2:54:06] Zeoxys: right bc when bfa was over people definitely didnt say bfa had too much loot
[2:54:12] Zeoxys: that was never a point of vonvo
[2:54:35] Moobot: Calm it with those symbols, @a1steaksauc3 (warning)
[2:54:58] Clicklesly: I mean, there should be a middle zone between too much and too few ^^
[2:54:59] Korupcija_: rank 4 monkaS
[2:55:03] Waspire: i wish for a small change for the maw...the hunt meter goes up too fast...reduce that..
[2:55:05] abbosss: ya i fail to see how that was a problem
[2:55:09] a1steaksauc3: i bet my entire savings and roth ira fund into gamestop stocks. im either making it or living on food stamps! HOLD BABY
[2:55:15] casualboomer: @Towelliee wakener's frond (hyper haste trinket) up in Ardenweald on my pally
[2:55:18] bmwhockey: honestly doesnt feel like too much loot to me
[2:55:20] casualboomer: Might check on yours
[2:55:37] idenkaz_: at least you got something out of it by scrapping it.
[2:55:40] bmwhockey: it should feel like a cool reward and not an obligation
[2:55:45] Shallo1988: atleast you could sell that gear for gold lol
[2:55:53] stratiss: true
[2:56:26] abbosss: i wouldnt even have a problem doing more M+ for loot, thats all i did at the end of BFA, but i just get so demotivated after pugging for 3 hours and getting maybe 2 pieces of loot, neither of which i need
[2:56:56] aid280: @abbosss you got two after three hours? That's insane.
[2:57:01] aid280: @abbosss lucky man.
[2:57:03] casualboomer: Blizzard can't find middle ground on anything. Period.
[2:57:03] Ralvay: there shouldn't be personal loot in any mmorpg game or you can't say it is "rpg".. lol
[2:57:08] abbosss: @aid280 LUL
[2:57:14] Shirey36: too little is better because u can always multi task on alts
[2:57:18] aid280: @abbosss that's actually incredibly high haha
[2:57:28] othraerir: what do you think about master loot? maybe for mythic raid only?
[2:57:28] abbosss: @aid280 may have been an exaggeration KEKW
[2:57:37] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee My dad heard the stream and thought it was me talking. Apparently, I sound like you. Which is weird since I'm a southern white boy. I think my dad's hearing is going.
[2:57:39] gangstafred: it was too little loot
[2:57:41] aid280: @abbosss LULW
[2:57:44] EpicJune: should stay more than one expansion imho
[2:58:03] blazeofhell: I wish WOW moved more towards looter shooter/ARPG side like Division 2 or POE, Division doesn't have a lot of skills or passives like POE but because of sheer amount of loot and stats, exotics(read legendaries) you can create fun and viable builds for all aspects of the game, while wow for me doesn't have that
[2:58:33] Malarick: gotta revert the drop changes. I do not want to go back to Wrath Heroic spamming
[2:58:34] Kinghorn: I just want more anima, I am not doing these 10 minute world quests for 70 anima
[2:58:43] Thoreya: oh damn echo is streaming their practices now?
[2:58:45] Thoreya: pog
[2:58:50] infektyd: also have anima scale with difficulty, like a +15 should have more anima than an M0
[2:58:51] pilhass10: 4400
[2:59:01] stratiss: I think an increase in raid loot would fix a lot of problems. Raiding should be as rewarding if not more so than pvp/mythic +
[2:59:09] heavymetal_link: i had to step away from the game for a month or 2 and now i feel lost and confused/overwhelmed from the content not sure where to start
[2:59:16] pilhass10: 550 each week yea
[2:59:28] blazeofhell: @stratiss raiding is not spamable so it should be more rewarding than m+
[2:59:37] blazeofhell: at least to some extent
[2:59:41] stratiss: @stratiss agreed
[2:59:49] Clicklesly: Or they could just use Anima ^^
[2:59:50] Kindosar: valor = conq / justice = honor - balancing would be awkward because at what point can you upgrade
[3:00:03] Malarick: or boost Anima production and use that to upgrade
[3:00:08] smashwow: honestly you could give us Valor and Justice pts. just like in cata @Towelliee
[3:00:21] aid280: Am I the only one who likes the current drop rates? Makes getting a new peice feel good. And at the current speed my guild is progressing it works out nicely. Problem is with people they want everything yesterday. If they're not 220 in a month they're moaning.
[3:00:33] Sandisy: if they're happy to bleed subs until the next patch, sure
[3:00:35] mrrazputin: There is an easy solution for loot system. Put the gear in cash shop. lolol
[3:00:40] blazeofhell: it won't be this patch def, something major needs to be done to fix loot, so regular players just need to sit tight
[3:00:40] Kirorga: pvp gear is fine just dont allow 233 weps first week
[3:00:48] goochydrood64: When does 9.1 start?
[3:00:48] casualboomer: @Towelliee wakener's frond (hyper haste trinket) up in Ardenweald on my pally
[3:00:50] Kinghorn: so people who dont pvp start behind everyone in 9.1, cool
[3:01:00] FOQUZ_TV: @mrrazputin Gear is already in gold shop... up to a point
[3:01:11] FOQUZ_TV: cash shop*
[3:01:19] abbosss: @aid280 i think its more that there ends up being a lot of "gate keeping" in PuGs, if you don't have an achievement or 215+ Ilvl good luck
[3:01:20] Thoreya: 9.1 is in like 4 months....if ur not geared by then..thats a personal problem haha
[3:01:32] SuperCracker: When I said I wanted to play the beta I didn’t mean a post launch beta..
[3:01:40] KingSlayerYotam: blizz should take the time to build, we cant chase systems like we did in bfa
[3:01:45] mrrazputin: @foquzinho where ? i cant use my $ to get a biss weapon
[3:01:58] abbosss: @aid280 not that its not happened before, just its a lot more of an issue with the current rates
[3:02:05] aid280: @abbosss True in ways. But getting through the raid isn't overly hard in let's say HC. Patience and finding a guild is easy
[3:02:26] abbosss: @aid280 not as a tank :( every1s attached to theirs
[3:02:33] casualboomer: BOOOOO
[3:02:35] CritcobainTV: FeelsBadMan
[3:02:38] casualboomer: now I have it on my dh and my pally
[3:02:58] aid280: @abbosss ah I guess man. Im lucky in that sense as I stayed with my guild from BFA. We went inactive for 5 months then returned for SL
[3:02:59] abbosss: @aid280 but you are right, finding a decent guild goes a long way
[3:03:17] A_New_Challenger: lol
[3:03:23] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[3:03:24] Garrujak: Garrujak subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 78 months! Hammers up!
[3:03:25] Clay2K_: towKing
[3:03:26] bennythejet_ne: You going to run any keys today brother?
[3:03:29] propoopimus: AGREE
[3:03:30] jaysteea: we hate that guy too
[3:04:04] Gruffian: Dungeon Points, let's go Blizz.
[3:04:08] abbosss: @aid280 i joined a guild at the end of legion and we raided thru the end of BFA, but some drama happened and the guild disbanded after almost 3 years FeelsBadMan been trying to find a new home since
[3:04:17] Thoreya: blizz is gonna make SL a bfa loot pinata again and we boutta have a lotta bad players with good ilvls like the titanforging days
[3:04:19] Thoreya: imo
[3:04:55] aid280: @abbosss probably stupid question but tried the guild finger thing? That could be useful. Surely there's a guild out there looking for tank LULW
[3:05:27] propoopimus: even worse, with no bonus you cant even target a boss or dungeon for a trinket/gear
[3:05:34] LordKain73: I see plenty 9f bad players with good ilvle now...
[3:05:53] Taurideum: Playing prot pally in 2's skirmish is more tryhard KEKW
[3:06:00] abbosss: @aid280 oh I have LUL its really only new or reforming guilds that are looking for a tank, itd probably be worth in the end to get my foot in the door and wait to see if they turn out good, but that's kind of a big time investment

[3:31:17] Lesliech0w: We talking about WG?
[3:31:18] Kromede: thats not what she said Kappa
[3:31:27] dimofodi: Instead of putting a timer on it, they should make players stronger and healers weaker so people just nuke each other out of resources.

[3:31:35] Kinghorn: korvGherkin
[3:31:37] MrFuzzynuts420: so many warriors now, i'm noticing it more in M+ too. they the best melee now or something?

[3:31:42] tlsmith3638: you just got to kill 89 more of them you can do it lol
[3:31:46] piratechris: They are running out of reinforcements so it wont run the timer out

[3:44:43] rosina_scarlett: @Towelliee have you ever gotten Wintergrasp on attack that is the biggest waste of time ever
[3:44:50] D3m0nHunt3r666: this is why you dont do BGs this early
[3:45:38] MrFuzzynuts420: @Masumii3 for real. its better to take the 15min debuff than to waste 45mins attacking in Winterspring
[3:45:59] rosina_scarlett: @MrFuzzynuts420 i completely agree
[3:46:11] D3m0nHunt3r666: it does
[3:46:25] rosina_scarlett: @MrFuzzynuts420 the defending team could afk and you still couldn't win in 45 mins LUL

[4:05:48] TheRavenGrave: The Idea is the fact that the mojority of ppl now know they can affect the market. So what should have happened on the gamestop issue is they should have sold once they made money and finished offf gamestop
[4:05:51] daniel85mg: Yes, dungeons are way better
[4:05:52] MrGattz: oh the dungeon layouts are so fantastic
[4:05:53] Wulfgrym: yeah
[4:05:55] JmacTV: SL dungeons are dope except for Plaguefall...
[4:06:09] MrGattz: and they look amazing in SL. i just dont want to run them cause i get nothing for it.
[4:06:17] warpride777: vault is great if you run 4 dungeons
[4:06:18] armeleth: PF and the Ardenweald bit of DOS, but not really
[4:06:18] MrFuzzynuts420: @Towelliee the dungeons are great. but i have no motivation to tank a ton of M+ to maybe...just maybe get a drop...
[4:06:20] Aro725: I had more fun in m plus then im having now for sure. Even with better dungeons no loot just sucks
[4:06:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: PF reminds me of SotS tbh, i hate both LUL
[4:06:23] Xailen: you got gear if you did M+ in BFA, not in SL lol
[4:06:40] JmacTV: Doing an 11 for 203 loot is pathetic ngl
[4:06:43] Vigi9413: the ilvl from end of dungeon compared to the vault is such a huge gap now
[4:06:49] stratiss: havent done a key after KSM on my main
[4:07:00] thiccsushi: There should be a transmog set and title for timing everything on all 20s having it stop at 15 for rewards is a joke
[4:07:00] casualboomer: Dungeon design? Better. Playerbase? Worse. Corruption carried SO MANY people who are bad at the game in M+
[4:07:05] warpride777: my bane is bosses that one shot you for standing in something for .000001 second lol
[4:07:06] casualboomer: soooo many keys fall apart
[4:07:12] I_DoctorSatan_I: Im having more fun with my Fury Warrior (alt) more than I am with my BM Hunter :/
[4:07:20] MOLAR305: I'm 201 ilvl and having to do an 11 for a slight upgrade is deeply unfulfilling
[4:07:30] armeleth: I've seen some huge fury pumpers
[4:07:30] casualboomer: I'm just swapping focus entirely to pvp until they fix loot
[4:07:31] ebone45: @JmacAUZ agreed, besides vault at the end of the week it's not even worth it, so are raids, trash loot drop rate
[4:07:43] Vigi9413: my favorite part is when pugs still hug glowing tendies in plaguefall
[4:07:48] SirYacob: I'm a mythic raider. I get one upgrade a week, and it's only from the vault.

[4:08:23] xluckydawgx: Vault in BFA would have been incredible
[4:08:26] armeleth: this week's keys are suck ass
[4:08:27] Vigi9413: might even gotten my gettikku faster
[4:08:30] I_DoctorSatan_I: I'm slappin 8-9k DPS w/ Spear of Bastion + Bladestorm combo + Signet of Torment Kings (wrist) is bread and butter for Fury, it's so good together.
[4:08:45] warpride777: did a high hoa key and man those golems when bolstered, that thrash dmg is whewww lol

[4:09:26] daniel85mg: Yeah, gettin to like 197ish ilvl feels like a chore rather 'gearing'
[4:09:33] ebone45: you're not lying
[4:09:33] godgwen: @Towelliee i agree, but gotta go with the flow of the xpac
[4:09:37] casualboomer: PVP is fine where it's at EXCEPT weapons
[4:09:47] godgwen: to stay relevant
[4:09:48] armeleth: Uh does anyone know a good addon that alerts you when servers come up
[4:09:51] Unciatim: No.. F PVP... it ruins everything
[4:10:01] Alaquane: AV gear was added after molten core
[4:10:06] thebakeriscomingforu: its all climbing
[4:10:06] MOLAR305: amc hit 16 and is back to 12
[4:10:15] Dimpixels: @Towelliee lol every time i open your stream i hear fuck pvp lol i know your not saying that tho
[4:10:18] wellborn: It's not the pvp players believe that, it's the game designers at this point.
[4:10:28] Affiiance: The "I only play one aspect of the game" crew cracks me up. Diversify yourselves noobs
[4:10:42] Fals3G0d: @Towelliee in your opinion, what's the best MT/OT combo in SL for Heroic/Mythic raiding?
[4:11:00] Simple_Hero: Are they suppose to drop the PvE loot changes in 9.1 or sooner?
[4:11:03] casualboomer: Because PvP is still a better more reliable route to gear UNTIL they make the change
[4:11:04] rosina_scarlett: @Fals3G0d Brewmaster/Vengance DH
[4:11:05] Traexler: Even for a pve player, pvp will be ok to gear alts and have some fun
[4:11:09] casualboomer: So if I'm going to play, I'm going to maximize my time
[4:11:27] Unciatim: The "I want people to play all the aspects of the game" crew cracks me up. I pay for the game I'll play it how the F I want.
[4:11:34] griffdog125: pvp gear should have had a in pvp only useful stat so it wasn't beneficial in pve to farm it
[4:11:36] JmacTV: I main BDK but swopped recently to Veng DH as I mainly run Mythic + but gearing again is eh
[4:11:39] godgwen: @casualboomer yeah what you said
[4:11:55] rosina_scarlett: Vengance + vengance
[4:12:00] xxbrenegadexx: @boomeranng125 that's how it used to be.
[4:12:02] SamAddams: @towelliee isn’t Havoc good on cleave lately?

[4:12:29] ebone45: the fiery brand legendary is pretty OP, it helps alot
[4:12:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Affiiance Forcing players to play content that rewards better gear flow, which PvP does, isn't the way to go for people who don't like those pieces of content, i.e. PvP or Raiding. Some players, not all, just like M+ for targeting gear.
[4:12:41] MrFuzzynuts420: #MakeHavocGreatAgain
[4:12:44] cRUSSIANthegame: Did I miss a blue post on loot changes Towelie was talking about?
[4:12:51] Malkantar: this has been my worse experiance in wow. this is the 1st time in 15 years i have 0 friends playing so i cant get anything done at all
[4:12:55] Vigi9413: Both of my toons now have +9 DoS... how'd I get so lucky....
[4:12:59] xxbrenegadexx: @ I agree, having no PvP benefits just makes it a form of a PvE item in a sense.
[4:13:14] rsimpson105: so what is the maintenance today for? sorry joined late
[4:13:18] Affiiance: @I_DoctorSatan_I Then just do one piece of content, but you sohuldnt get rewarded for doing so

[4:14:34] Stariot: whats the maintenance for
[4:14:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Affiiance Why not? If someoene is playing just M+ for gear content and get x3 220, or x3 226 gear to choose from weekly GV, why should they not get rewarded? I dont understand ur logic.
[4:14:42] Vigi9413: in case anyone was wondering Overwatch is hiring according to bnet lol

[4:14:44] Unciatim: @Affiiance And being forced to do PVP which many peeps don't like to get best PVE gear isn't right either....
[4:14:46] griffdog125: even the pvp trinkets are bis for some classes in pve like disc priest
[4:15:05] daniel85mg: same with hpal

[4:15:33] Kolzko: Tooms1013 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[4:20:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: @Affiiance what do you mean? There's a huge difference on what content ppl do for gear. Someone who just does Mythic+ will just get bare minimum BiS gear whereas someone who PvP's and Raid have a greater chance of BiS gear. That's the difference than someone who just does one avenue of content for gearing.
[4:20:41] Affiiance: Whisper me if you want to talk more, Towels chat isnt the place to have this convo
[4:21:15] I_DoctorSatan_I: LUL

[4:25:56] Koravd: Is leveling in WOD still the fastest?
[4:26:05] Affiiance: Someone was probably eploiting something
[4:26:09] Jigy_LB: How's sludge prog so far?
[4:26:27] Secondbreakfasttt: you maxout tho LUL
[4:26:28] Unciatim: Maybe our free mount?

[4:28:18] thiccsushi: If you remove OCEE there is none from NA
[4:28:22] Affiiance: Its funny but its also sad
[4:28:25] ChaoticPriest: jesus fuck. I didn't know it was THAT bad.
[4:28:27] clariusgaming: more impressive to have done it as alliance then
[4:28:28] I_DoctorSatan_I: we got bamboozled with that free Tree mount promised at launch LUL What a sales pitch from Blizzard. Blizzard be like...."hahaha, got emmmmmm..."
[4:28:31] lizard007: diversity quota lol
[4:28:31] theoriginalzinng: remember when everybody was like "roll alliance for dwarf bleed removal kekw"
[4:28:37] Niixten: cross realm mythic won't happen this tier :P
[4:28:46] propoopimus: No it’s just sad, and blizzard don’t even care
[4:28:48] ThatGuyFayde: NA LUL LUL LUL
[4:28:49] Elder_Direwolf: even more lul
[4:28:51] OhNoNotAgain: This is Fine HypeFire HypeFire
[4:28:53] Orczeus: its called NORTH AMERICA
[4:29:08] TheCliffyShow: Maybe if the WoW community weren't a bunch of sheep just going to the same faction as famous raiders because they want to be in the "cool" faction, then this wouldn't be happening.
[4:29:08] Unciatim: Well.. what do expect @Towelliee when such a large % of population plays Horde... it only gets worse after each expansion.. Blizz created this nightmare and they arent' going to fix it anytime soon....
[4:29:14] letrickyxd: blizzard has always had a horde bias
[4:29:22] Stormrazer78: Na world first up for grabs
[4:29:26] thebakeriscomingforu: i've been in 3 guilds and switched to horde this xpac. been crazy on alliance side
[4:29:27] thiccsushi: Time to let people play cross faction for raiding
[4:29:28] letrickyxd: then saying that they don't care to merge ally and horde made it very prominent
[4:29:37] ThatGuyFayde: @thecliffyshow just by your message you must be alliance LUL LUL
[4:29:38] Unciatim: No.. not really
[4:29:47] Affiiance: Mythic + suffers from it too
[4:29:58] zaraine1: and the mythic + and the pvp LUL
[4:30:14] xlagzr: thats crazy
[4:30:18] SubtlePat: Most Alliance players are toxic af, immature and stupid. No wonder why there's no NA Alliance raiding guilds.
[4:30:19] szeeman62: @towelliee friendly banter on Stormrage is 9/10
[4:30:23] Sollice: Why is there such a disparity though? Racials?
[4:30:26] thebakeriscomingforu: most alliance players i know or knew of switched horde or left the game to play FF14
[4:30:31] letrickyxd: @TheCliffyShow yeah cause they want a better chance at being able to do end game :)
[4:30:36] theoriginalzinng: id totally be dark iron dwarf on everything if i could also play horde lol
[4:30:39] I_DoctorSatan_I: we all know EU and Asia are known for cheats/hacks in most video games anyway Kappa Kappa
[4:30:44] thiccsushi: If limit moved to alliance then they would lose a lot of people feeding them gear
[4:31:04] Naganick: Didn't limit say i the preach interview they had considered it; but its cost prohibitive
[4:31:08] Affiiance: They just need to make Cross Faction grouping ffs
[4:31:12] IxProNoobxI: BOE's were a major factor at this tier though right? don't think they would have had access to as many BOE's
[4:31:12] Templexx: some lower ones probably would.
[4:31:16] Nightshaft25: For the horde! towQueen

[4:31:30] Lexi__Marie: dont fix what aint broke, in regards to limit going alliance
[4:31:50] zuluhawk: Alliance has always been younger or kiddish, Horde had seemingly more mature players, has changed since the game launched to now of course

[4:33:09] robertjordan83: @Towelliee alliance is normal/herioc raiders and horde is mythic
[4:33:16] neverbornlucky: i just do not like pvp servers

[4:35:05] Screamxan: I hope pve will become as good as pvp gearing wise, fuck man pvp is boring in wow
[4:35:05] clariusgaming: sloot disbanded guild
[4:35:06] akia03: so 6-7 weeks till 9.1?
[4:35:20] Sollice: @Unciatim Future has been disbanded and he is taking some time off
[4:35:20] thiccsushi: I'm holding my shit
[4:35:21] xxbrenegadexx: I have mained Alliance since vanilla, granted I do have some horde toons, but will always main Ally. :D
[4:35:23] letrickyxd: 🚀
[4:35:25] Koravd: Thankfully Ion said they already have some ideas to fix PVE gearing for next patch

[4:35:40] sterlingpls: @Towelliee HAve faith shibes
[4:35:41] LiveJuniorr: When is Sloot coming back?
[4:35:45] letrickyxd: it was 340 an hour ago

[4:35:53] SubtlePat: @godgwen Vers is good for all classes
[4:36:07] thebakeriscomingforu: all week the hot stocks built up in the morning and then dipped hard. then popped back up in the afternoon
[4:36:08] I_DoctorSatan_I: @kevaly Saying and doing are two different things...
[4:36:09] Unciatim: @Sollice Damn ok... sad to hear... but i know he has been having sleeping issues for a while... might have been affecting him more than we all knew...
[4:36:15] thebakeriscomingforu: we'll see if the pattern continues
[4:36:16] zuluhawk: I main horde have one Alliance toon for story lol
[4:36:22] Sollice: Right. He just needed a break
[4:36:30] godgwen: @SubtlePat righttttt
[4:36:41] ThatGuyFayde: we should have like a alliance pride month...celebrate equality SeemsGood
[4:36:43] jason_tacey: he was pumping for weeks after SL dropped
[4:36:48] Koravd: @I_DoctorSatan_I Well he said they were doing it for next patch, everytime they get an interview and they say they will do something they tend to do it
[4:36:49] letrickyxd: I love Ally, but I'm Horde and I'm ok with it. The only thing I would love is The Nightborne could be Druids
[4:36:50] wellborn: @Towelliee pvp gear is super easy to get and it's guaranteed if you win. You're NOT guaranteed the pieces you need even if you do down Mythic raid bosses or time M+15 etc
[4:36:54] SpencerHD: He's got
[4:36:56] SpencerHD: Pucca there
[4:37:16] zuluhawk: I want Worgen to be monks gadammit
[4:37:16] ebone45: he was working so hard on WA UI's too befire SL, poor guy looked exhausted

[4:37:32] sterlingpls: @Towelliee lets not discount the honor grind lol that shit is wackkkkkkkkkkkkkk
[4:37:37] DrGosling: 1800 is ez but 2100 is tough
[4:37:45] xxbrenegadexx: When you grind as hard as a normal streamer does, streaming/grinding can wear/break a person down, especially if they have done it for years. It's a good thing for people to take breaks for themselves here and there.
[4:37:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: @kevaly Yet we don't have our free tree mount we voted for back in August when it was promised mount at launch LUL Kappa but..we'll see i guess
[4:37:53] DrGosling: recruitie and I were talking about it the other day too
[4:37:54] Affiiance: Honor grind? I have so much honor I dont know what to do with it
[4:37:56] wellborn: I don't pvp at all until this xpac. And I have 1600 fairly easy as WW monk
[4:38:04] godgwen: getting past 16000rbg is pretty rough for casuals
[4:38:09] Aro725: 1800 is not as easy as you think right now. So many glad boosting that 1600 is the new 2100 lol
[4:38:10] DrGosling: especially since we both main boomies and that full moon nerfs
[4:38:14] sterlingpls: @drgosling That's not true. 1600 is like 86 percentile of rating. so saying 1800 is EZ is WRONGGGGGGGGGGGGG
[4:38:17] Screamxan: thats not because ppl cant do it alone, its also because pvp is super boring @Towelliee
[4:38:22] IxProNoobxI: ww monk stating pvp is easy LUL
[4:38:23] clariusgaming: most of the players cant even get 1800
[4:38:25] Redbearded16: @towelliee what’s the highest scaling honor gear goes to? Like 180ish?
[4:38:40] wellborn: 197 @Redbearded16
[4:38:42] Koravd: @I_DoctorSatan_I It wasnt promised at launch, they said it was Q1 of 2021 since the start. Go look up the post

[4:39:04] letrickyxd: 2 mill from 1.8 he siad
[4:39:08] Krellel: What addon are you using to track PoB,Freedom ?
[4:39:09] DrGosling: @sterlingpls depends on individuals, i have my rsham and now disc to 1800 in a week, and they are both 215+ gear in under 10 days
[4:39:15] Affiiance: FYI just because you buy a boost to 2100 doesnt mean someone can actually carry you to 2100
[4:39:26] bosseja: why the maintenance today? @Towelliee
[4:39:29] mandarinetip: then why charge so much lol.
[4:39:31] clariusgaming: I heard Xaryu would boost you for free Towelliee :P
[4:39:35] AP__Simps: cant take a ilvl 180 lol
[4:39:43] evil995: server needs to get up now or my depression will kick in again
[4:39:46] clariusgaming: yeah
[4:39:48] letrickyxd: @Towelliee What happens if said booster can't boost the person cause of skill? Do they get money back or that?
[4:39:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: Just be a HDH, 3 buttons and ur set, ez 2100 LUL LUL Kappa
[4:40:05] wellborn: He did say that on his stream the other day, that he would boost you for free
[4:40:24] clariusgaming: He said that on his stream when someone mentioned you paid for it and he would gladly help you
[4:40:36] Poriand: the boosting prices seem a little high
[4:40:54] godgwen: xD
[4:40:54] ChaoticPriest: sells like hotcakes
[4:40:58] snipsfan: high because demand is there
[4:41:06] Affiiance: Bc the boosters are rank 1 players lmao, not just anyone can boost people
[4:41:06] Kinghorn: have you seen the prices of mythic boes on the AH?

[5:00:44] I_DoctorSatan_I: man, a Super Bowl without a full stadium sucks. This will be the first to go down in history.
[5:00:49] Dred_Scythe: At that point @Towelliee you'll be able to buy one of the casinos...lol
[5:00:53] thebakeriscomingforu: So the goal that is my understanding is to keep buying up the available stock to prevent the hedgefunds from having the stock to cover their "short". Thus driving up the prices further
[5:00:59] Sollice: !permit naganick

[5:03:22] I_DoctorSatan_I: get a PF boost Kappa Kappa
[5:03:37] WildGinger85: @thebakeriscomingforu Basically. They are essentially catching the Hedge Funds in a loop. Retail Investors drove up the stock causing the HF to purchase at least some stocks before they go higher so they can pay back the stocks without loosing more, but by buying more it increases the stock prices as well, kind of F***ing themselves. And the wheel keeps turning. Eventually, the HF becomes insolvent, OR they need to generate the capital to actually buy back all the shares they borrowed.
[5:04:46] blazeofhell: well, the scalling in lfg on low levels was broken when I was leveling. my holy palading was top dps in all dungeon runs on normal and heroic
