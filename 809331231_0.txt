[1:27:57] CristiUT: What covenant is best for BM Hunter? @Towelliee
[1:28:01] Therapy_Kittenz: It works differently in Georgia. My taxes are dependent on the area and what houses around me are worth. I bought my house for 129k but i pay for 180k in taxes

[2:38:40] MorteDeAngelis: @brandon_ttd Most guilds that Mythic raid typically have between 2-4 hrs raids a day. If you only have an hr a day you'd struggle to get the raid in let alone the stuff you need to do outside of raid
[2:38:47] abeester: @swordart_19 yea i have but this isn't like any old expansion
[2:38:47] idenkaz_: you think Khadgar will come back for SL later?

[2:40:07] abeester: That doesn't sound like 2-3 hours though
[2:40:08] MorteDeAngelis: @brandon_ttd You also need time to do the required stuff outside of raids, Unless you're not looking at clearing the raid on mythic, then 1-2 hrs a day is really cutting it tight.

[4:14:13] Archiee: Why do we say 'we' won a sports game when, in fact, the sports fan on the couch didn't win anything? It has to do with our psychological attachment to a team, and in the literature, it's called 'fan identification. ' So, [the common term is] 'BIRGing,' which means 'basking in reflected glory.

[4:43:20] SnackbarTV: Intel is screwed. Even Apple is dumping them.
[4:43:22] Drakenking: @Mrt_lols I'm sure you realize how awkward of a video that is especially considering how much closer shadowlands is to the older style of the game. It really seems like he's not happy with current online culture and what it's done to guilds
[4:43:33] Vahlkor: which Thredripper is that?

[4:44:14] Stipje: I just resubbed but was not able to share it cus I needed to be a follower for 6 min to be able to chat. This a bug? @towelliee
[4:44:27] sloppydood: How many alts do you have for farming?
[4:44:29] NeoJon82: yeah, he did that for Godfall due to how "pretty" the game was
[4:44:30] zinbers: In my pc I have a amd 9 3900x it runs insane to stream and run games at the same time
[4:44:32] TheNamesCrotch: @Drakenking Agreed. That dev seems more like a Classic player and yet he complained about classic too.

[4:45:58] Rygaros: twitch in 8k soon? NOT LUL
[4:46:16] cswowko: i think twitch wont increase bitrate, because they would lost a lot of viewers cuz of bad internet. I think this is the reason why its still 6k or something
[4:46:23] PoppaMetal: is overwolf gonna be a good addon maanger or or is there another people are using
[4:46:23] donol: 3 of 3 toons with Papa's New bag

[4:47:48] maalow: Draenor EU KEKW
[4:47:55] MetallicusGaming: Question, if you have WM on and you know with full heirloom set when you lvl up you do aoe dmg. Does that also dmg on enemy players when they are near you?
[4:47:59] toocheap2rhyme: thats a bummer
[4:48:07] captain69: do u think method got chance again to be top?

[4:48:48] MetallicusGaming: think they merged with Aversion or something for Twisting Nether
[4:48:49] m__ber: it doesnt really matter anyway because you still need to do all of the campaign quests. hitting 60 fast isnt really relevant
[4:48:55] Thoreya: A top like 300 guild called Reason
[4:49:00] MetallicusGaming: or Reason
[4:49:02] Thoreya: They got Fem who‚Äôs a really good tank too
[4:49:05] Vivelli: strawberry/banana Gfuel + milk = not bad

[4:49:50] SonofHorus82: people that dont understand the concept of flying above the rare spawn so they dont get murdered by mobs while afk, why are you the way that you are?
[4:49:51] kayed3: they have Sco right ?
[4:50:02] sstriife: justwait is now bigwigs guy
[4:50:02] chronoit: I stopped caring about the race when I realized the top teams were all kind of toxic.
[4:50:05] MetallicusGaming: not with Reason
[4:50:08] 5rooms: who do you think will be the strongest contender of Limit?
[4:50:08] sstriife: and dps
[4:50:12] kamisengames: Method should have been completely dismantled for their gross negligence
[4:50:15] Kasharan: I'm guessing Sco is gonna be raid leading with Scripe gone?
[4:50:30] Advct777: are shadow priest still a good class? or resto druids? those were my mains, but I havent played in 5 years or so... thinking of coming back
[4:50:33] MetallicusGaming: I thought for some "reason" it was Aversion LUL (no pun intented)

[4:50:54] manmower: hold my beer
[4:50:55] MetallicusGaming: and Sco is only tanking 1st tier and he'll quit afterwards
[4:51:01] Koalabaer79: Sco already mentioned he has a new raidleader
[4:51:20] denflup: sco its not a world class tank eitgher
[4:51:21] nazzari01: who did those players go to?
[4:51:22] denflup: either*
[4:51:28] nazzari01: Who left and to where?

[4:53:53] wastedx3149: thought so, he was a goat for challenge modes
[4:53:58] nazzari01: They need to recruit Towelliee to keep them awake! You can whip them into shape!
[4:54:00] arthritisy: if Max left Limit, the entire playing team is actually still intact
[4:54:05] Gorestack: well according to forums, anyone can be a world first player if they play full time towTinfoil
[4:54:06] eyemyor: Sco did get some good people, thats for sure. Just remains to be seen how well they can stand up.
[4:54:08] Drakenking: @Rygaros nah hes done raiding, sco was honestly a weak point for the guild in terms of players, there are better tanks out there
[4:54:14] Drakenking: Hes still in management tho
[4:54:14] fluh_: Yeah he's a melee beast like frag
[4:54:18] jason_shade: i just think a lot of people don't know what even goes into raiding at a decent level much less their level on the back-end
[4:54:28] MetallicusGaming: ^
[4:54:29] Moose_Ka: Is the bag a unique?
[4:54:38] Nitrosulphur: @epicmooseka Yea
[4:54:39] chronoit: I just think it's weird that eacho exists as well given they also all just ignored the fact that they were playing with a rapist pedo. They just got to use the "we had no idea it's the method orgs fault"
[4:54:41] Bluelocks: whats the drop chance on that bag
[4:54:46] eyemyor: High end raiding is fucking draining. I gave that shit up in Everquest.

[4:57:51] Moose_Ka: I think this pre expansion event was pretty weak.
[4:57:53] aimassistallen: @towelliee so Monday. We level and don‚Äôt have to pick a covenant until 60 right?
[4:58:03] Masqerader: speaking of portals those bitches better revert the npc in orgr to teleport to blasted lands
[4:58:04] neverbornlucky: on Draenor some cruel person infected the mage portal area of stormwind it wsas a nightmare for leveling
[4:58:05] Ras_Aku: you can always count on the wow community to bring an event literally to life lol
[4:58:06] ShinoaKurisu: sha was the same way
[4:58:12] arthritisy: I kinda wished they made it a huge royale game for a week and once you got ghouled, you couldn't go back
[4:58:12] Vile_: @FosSiLiTate Ah yes, immersion. "Sorry, your flying mounts don't work for some arbitrary reason because it feels more real. No reason why they don't work tho!" 4Head
[4:58:27] Bloodhaven08: we get to test drive them
[4:58:28] LarcenousLaugh: It‚Äôs great except for the rare waiting in Icecrown. That shits annoying and keeping people from getting loot.
[4:58:36] arthritisy: but the ghoul was strong enough to do everything you needed to do as far as questing/dungeons/etc
[4:58:39] Advct777: @towelliee. I've been away for about 5 years or so. Thinking about returning for SL... are SPriest and RDruids both good classes?
[4:58:41] falsenx: pog
[4:58:42] suppstantial: Is there a guild for the Towelliee community? Just coming back after being away from WoW for a while!
[4:58:53] Moose_Ka: Why cant we just have them all? Arent we supposed to be a hero and everything. Why do we have to choose one

[5:00:13] Moose_Ka: Not really feeling Shadowlands tbh. Prolly just gonna stick to ffxiv and swtor unless shadowlands turns out to be really good
[5:00:30] d3vde: a few weeks ago someone (content creator idk exactly who) said that there is an argument for capping your char, not choosing a covenant and leveling an alt first for like 2 or 3 days in case of any immediate changes, is that still valid advice @Towelliee
[5:00:33] Grock: swtor ü§£
[5:00:44] Cyntech89: A leveling competition?

[5:18:29] Sonatta: yikes
[5:18:33] keeindordel: :(
[5:18:39] Moose_Ka: isnt gfuel just pre workout stuff? Never drank either so idk.

[5:19:46] Its_Immanis: Might be a place that pays on a specific numbered day (my company does the 5th and 20th) so days of the week are random
[5:19:47] DinkytheDoodle: It seems like every time I tune in now it‚Äôs always about gfuel...

[5:20:03] Sincline387: I bought my starters the first time you had 30% off, that was an ok deal.
[5:20:07] Eelz255: @Pallimmanis that's very strange and not something you see very often.
[5:20:13] shmurcules: A lot of companies don‚Äôt have payday on Friday anymore because people always call in on Friday for payday lol

[5:21:41] DrWho4ever: I like the Blue Ice and Fazeberry flavors

[5:29:09] gat_1000: bottom right is total
[5:29:09] BearOfLight: If anyone wants Jerky recommendations - Not Turkey but Keto friendly and only 75 calories a pack - Jim Dandy beef jerky. Best jerky I've ever had.
[5:29:14] cabalish: 1279d
[5:29:30] SirBeetus: Is kyrian still going to be the go to for BM monk for raiding? Or necro now?

[5:29:39] Molvonos: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Errant bits away!
[5:29:47] Flattuss: For keto I dig the Dukes Hatch Green Chili Snack Sticks
[5:29:50] Drakenking: @desmo7 not really, macro nutrients are more important and if you're doing a lot of lifting balancing protein and fat more is important, something can be keto friendly and still be low in fat, like beef jerky
[5:29:58] Blas0n: @sirbeetus Necrolord

[5:32:20] Drakenking: Including sub and outlaw rogue
[5:32:21] Lifeafterdeath2: whats best for demon hunters
[5:32:22] Glommerwort: for me, kyrian fits theme of paladin better than venthyr
[5:32:27] Dcarter: but I expect that to get changed
[5:32:27] JamesNeuro: what would disci priest go for? venthyr for the damage burst and healing for atonement?
[5:32:42] Drakenking: actually rogue skips the potency conduit LUL
[5:32:50] Drakenking: the other talent is a flat dps increase
[5:32:53] Dcarter: fits the theme I wish that how u choose stuff lol

[5:33:59] aidiotat: Gonna suck when they switch all the numbers
[5:34:00] MorteDeAngelis: Ret is ventry also pretty sure, Hpal is def Kyrian, at least rn
[5:34:09] MorteDeAngelis: Venthyr*
[5:34:23] KnsWoW: I just ordered a starter pack.. Hope to like it so I can order more.

[5:34:52] Blas0n: @towelliee So Kyrian or NECROLORD for bm monk
[5:34:55] m__ber: yea
[5:35:06] MorteDeAngelis: It doesn't replicate for each cast like it does, so the Synergy is reduced, but the follow up Shocks are better

[5:43:12] SoviOso: @atrise wait, what?

[5:43:40] porzi__: I¬¥m rdy for SL bought 3 limited Shirts i¬¥m so excited @Towelliee towBleedpurple
[5:44:07] AdmiralRanmaru: @Towelliee what's the standard 'I'm doing okay' dps in pre-patch that most people are at?
[5:44:39] Buckwink: like 3k
[5:44:41] Shablagoosh: 3k
[5:44:42] 24sevn: any trinket sims?
[5:44:44] Buckwink: 2 is bad
[5:44:52] Thdlock: SourPls
[5:44:57] Gaaralock: @Towelliee Somebody got the vicious spider mount from prepatch arenas. It's on wowhead
[5:45:02] Moose_Ka: Where are you looking at these sims?
[5:45:07] twowheelsonelife: Warrior 1.5k feelsbadman
[5:45:07] Kisswani: @Thdlock FeelsBirthdayMan
[5:45:10] thegrt13: 1 .5 - 2k in prepatch gear
[5:45:11] Goblinemporium: Pre-patch DPS with 3 days left KEKWDISCO
[5:45:16] Scourgebane_: I dont play Wow any more so my knowledge is bad, don't know if that dinosaur mount is common but it's badass!
[5:45:23] Buckwink: if you're a DH it's 1.6k LULW
[5:45:35] Thdlock: there are some sims but bloodmallet not updated
[5:45:39] Thdlock: i have a mage sim bloodmallet like site
[5:45:40] doxxee: no they're waiting for sims to be done across the board
[5:45:52] Beltorz: what trinket gived you the speed boost?
[5:45:55] LukerX: do you know if i can have a crafter alt at 50 or do you need 60 to unlock stuff?
[5:46:08] AdmiralRanmaru: @Towelliee I never try to be the best, I try to just do okay.
[5:46:24] Zorias: think prot warriors will get some love anytime soon?
[5:46:53] Rio_duh: Mist def doesnt "suck"
[5:46:54] Sitt13: @Scourgebane_ i don't play either since years but i think, if you are talking about the "bronto", someone mentioned in another stream that it would cost 5.000.000 Gold
[5:46:54] Aeylid: cuz havoc does blow :)
[5:47:01] Aeylid: hence Veng bois unite!
[5:47:04] Thdlock: @Rio_Duh, for their progression mist sucks
[5:47:05] remixonfire91: havoc seems ok in pvp
[5:47:05] Kinghorn: they gutted havoc
[5:47:07] Buckwink: that's what my guild said. havoc isnt worth the 5% buff LULW
[5:47:09] vaxian_0528: havoc was absolutely gutted
[5:47:23] Masqerader: what happens when you destroy a spec because of borrowed power instead of actual data
[5:47:30] Thdlock: no thats accurate
[5:47:34] Thdlock: all monk specs suck
[5:47:36] denflup: DHTLock PogU
[5:47:38] Thdlock: and dh sucks as havoc
[5:47:43] kuwlord: towPog
[5:47:43] Flux_Capacitor: havoc feels so bad it hurts to play
[5:47:54] kuwlord: towF
[5:47:55] Thdlock: yew
[5:48:00] d3vde: @Scourgebane_ @Sitt13 its an auctionhouse mount that costs 5mio gold and become unavailable with SL yes that is correct
[5:48:03] Thdlock: dont wanna bring any tho
[5:48:03] Rio_duh: @Thdlock I think its important to clarify. Some of the biggest issues in the community is broad statements like that. Now everyone will think "shit now i cant play monk becasue they scuk" when they arent even doing mythic raiding
[5:48:08] SonofHorus82: @Towelliee what's that other window that opens when you kill? "millions of years of evolution" window?
[5:48:09] MOLAR305: woot, just got Mollie the alpaca
[5:48:10] Kinghorn: imagine having one of your 3 buttons nerfed so much you dont want to hit it, rip blade dance
[5:48:16] Aeylid: nah you minimize those melee and dont need that monk at all
[5:48:19] Aeylid: fuck dem monks
[5:48:24] Ferkan8: 777
[5:48:24] RedChaosTV: i would say brew and blood dk
[5:48:31] Zorias: ugh...but i wanna go Prot Warrior lmao
[5:48:35] B_Rock86: The only class that has been truely gutted is shaman. They literally took all of the cool abilities and gave them to other classes. Then took away the 2h option, and dropped our dps into the garbage lol.
[5:48:38] lekkahdh: havoc still gonna be my main, with shammy and lock alts
[5:48:40] RedChaosTV: Blood is the strongest for raids, and the brew 5% dmg buff for melee
[5:48:47] MrIndigestible: MrIndigestible subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 62 months! 
[5:48:51] Aeylid: nah you are bringing a veng dh because you sure AF aren't bringing a havoc lol

[5:49:27] d3vde: @Sitt13 np and yup^^'
[5:49:37] Kinghorn: yeah the only melee you are going to want to bring is a dh LUL
[5:49:45] Aeylid: no you aren't bringing a havoc
[5:49:48] Blas0n: @loremastermarthan classic
[5:49:49] Aeylid: you are bringing a veng
[5:49:51] Thdlock: havoc sucks u dont bring those
[5:49:56] SoviOso: okay, i get dk for dk, but why brew just for the buff? isn't ww or mw viable?
[5:50:00] Aeylid: exactly
[5:50:02] Thdlock: well most melee specs arent even physical
[5:50:02] MagicCrush: @Towelliee Hey Towlie!
[5:50:08] roflpotamus: what are the keywords?

[6:28:31] Drakenking: @Eraste you're free to have your opinion, Corruption was fun, the way you obtained corruption was not
[6:28:32] Sardaco: BFA was the worst expansion for ALTS
[6:28:34] xR1ZEx: Benthic gear got lost in the mix
[6:28:36] roeddogg: I prefer mustard, not ketcup.
[6:28:43] SteLawBro: I feel like im the only one that likes RNG loot. Having a set BIS list sucks. Once you get fully geared the games over.
[6:28:48] Blvdman: indeed
[6:28:51] Blvdman: you were so fucked
[6:28:51] SithLordBob: If you missed the first 1-2 months of Season4 bfa... you literally COULDNT CATCH UP for 8 months
[6:28:56] Justtise: sorry i missed the code for Gunner for the 10% off. can you provide again?
[6:28:58] KELLoGG_: i came back during 8.3.. and i had a lot of catch up, and i was honestly pretty lost.. but i only came back to play SL so... my time is near!
[6:28:59] HakenXor: tru dat, i came back at the end and it was soooo fucked up
[6:29:01] Rizec: personaly i dindt like corruption at all, I want me to be the diffrence in the dmg not rng proccs
[6:29:06] msmester1: I just skipped bfa EZ
[6:29:06] Sprucemoose: @Justtise towel
[6:29:07] Bloodsreign: @Towelliee I did that.. came back in 8.3 and just couldnt be bothered to grind essences
[6:29:11] feherlofia123: @stelawbro well arena when ur bis
[6:29:16] Attackroot: my friends that came back havent even gotten there neck from magni because they dont wanna waste time grinding before SL goes live lol
[6:29:18] Bernardo994: yes but it was a big pain in the dick to have to keep chasing the dragon
[6:29:22] lokifenrir1: i was in rehab most of bfa so missed alot @Towelliee
[6:29:32] salsanova75: I just made a new character last week, and almost at ilvl 100 as of yesterday....the prepatch catchup is real
[6:29:32] Justtise: towel worked. tysm
[6:29:34] Clorichu: i got screwed because i got asked to play a different class from 8.2 to 8.3 and that grind was obnoxious
[6:29:48] Rizec: @lokifenrir1982 ej good on ya hope you better know
[6:30:03] Exxcar: We are going to the days of just play the content you want to play... no more of this cross content requirements @Towelliee which I'm really looking for
[6:30:10] lokifenrir1: thank you
[6:30:12] Sardaco: cant wait for the vendor!
[6:30:12] nwat1234: shadowlands looks great the only thing thats worrysome is the covenants and conduit shit
[6:30:16] KELLoGG_: ketchup on steak, or no?
[6:30:17] m__ber: and a bunch of things are optional
[6:30:20] Colt_Engineer: I like mustard more
[6:30:22] pk99: Where's the mustard
[6:30:23] Quackthyr: WHERES THE MUSTARD!
[6:30:23] pj_playhouse: I only want to do tourgast one time, and then raiding
[6:30:25] msmester1: i love ketchup <3
[6:30:27] TheDread: There isn't catchup for torghast according to wowhead?
[6:30:28] SithLordBob: So is this a good xpac for having like 3-4 alts comfortably?
[6:30:30] Pathoren: ketchup and liquor Kappa
[6:30:30] Bl4ckSauce: @KELLoGG_ yeah why not
[6:30:30] pk99: everyone in chat a comedian
[6:30:32] SteLawBro: @feherlofia123 Bg's probably. Thats what i did in WoD. Get full BIS then i would just log in for like an hour a day and run a few bg's. Kinda sucked. I liked at least a small chance that something would drop that would still be an upgrade.
[6:30:34] Quackthyr: @pk99 LOL
[6:30:34] Sprucemoose: ketchup on steak should be a crime
[6:30:36] HunchoLeo_: im gonna be ripping torghast lol
[6:30:40] Masqerader: So much Ketchup its gonna put Heinz out of business
[6:30:42] KELLoGG_: @BlackSauceNoodles i live in KC, so my QB puts ketchup on steak.. i might as well
[6:30:46] Secondbreakfasttt: not ridiculous justice!
[6:30:53] LeonardLongNips: torghast is gonna be a blast
[6:30:54] Bl4ckSauce: @KELLoGG_ LUL
[6:31:00] connnelkiely: company got hit with ransomware so im off next week now haha what are the chances
[6:31:03] Thdlock: leveling 5 SMOrc
[6:31:05] idenkaz_: when i hear the word content i think of zones, quests, collectables. but thats just me.
[6:31:07] feherlofia123: so should i just pick whatever covenant and choose for reals by the time raid is out
[6:31:11] Exxcar: @LeonardLongNips agreed! My most looked forward to feature!
[6:31:20] SithLordBob: BFA and WOD are together at the bottom
[6:31:22] SithLordBob: LUL
[6:31:25] merrinator: Is this Luxos' weak aura for warriors?
[6:31:26] Attackroot: ya im force casual this xpac and ill still have like 3 toons at max within the first month
[6:31:27] Sprucemoose: mop was so fucking good
[6:31:28] ninedraft317: in the middle of the packs
[6:31:29] Colt_Engineer: BFA just had too much to do
[6:31:33] Masqerader: BFA gets B behind MOP, Legion for me
[6:31:34] Eraste: bfa on the bottom for sure
[6:31:40] smashwow: eh the great vault is ok. i still think it should be split up between the types of end game. the 3 options is nice. but it nets 1 piece of gear which is a huge nerf.
[6:31:43] Sprucemoose: mop had the hands down best most beautiful zones
[6:31:53] m__ber: i dunno, alot of people praise MoP class design but it was also really homogenous
[6:31:56] Eraste: bfa is the first time i didnt enjoy the story
[6:31:57] merrinator: @Towelliee what weak aura you using here??
[6:31:58] waitnc_gaming: WTF
[6:31:59] pj_playhouse: :O wow
[6:31:59] Urebaldd: bfa implemented too many systems it just got stupid
[6:32:00] Masqerader: WOD lives at the bottom
[6:32:01] Drakenking: I love wrath, I HATED Cata
[6:32:01] Lothawia: D:
[6:32:03] DragonofWolves: between Legion and BFA, both for the lore, but Legion for the execution
[6:32:07] LeonardLongNips: wrath????
[6:32:09] Keilsyar: Ulduar was so good
[6:32:09] Staksor: the only good thing about Wrath is Ulduar
[6:32:09] Rizec: i agree with most of that
[6:32:11] Drakenking: Cata made me quit WoW for 5 years
[6:32:16] Ordicos: i liked cata
[6:32:17] Sanctitas: imo ulduar is the best raid in wow
[6:32:17] Darkgx5: I love wow but it‚Äôs tuff to play when you have other obligations when you add catchup mechanics it makes the game more enjoyable for casuals
[6:32:18] Haigro: so controversial yet so brave
[6:32:18] Coriollis: ToC was a hole :)
[6:32:19] cineris_3: wrath is overhyped, wasnt bad just not great
[6:32:23] TheClipBeat: wod and bfa where the worst for me
[6:32:24] PotbellyGoat: towShappens
[6:32:24] Rizec: my bottom was cata wod bfa
[6:32:31] feherlofia123: cata is what made me quit for 10 years
[6:32:31] Masqerader: I liked cata cause I played a rogue and well daggers lol
[6:32:31] Exxcar: @Towelliee do you suggest Gunnar glasses or can I just use something like f.lux ?
[6:32:32] GamerKillance: Wrath had no content outside of raids. Was the WoD before WoD lol
[6:32:34] Mynth0l: mop pvp was so gpod
[6:32:34] MisterBongwater: draenor still at the bottom for me overall, i don't hate bfa that much i'd put it ahead of cata
[6:32:34] Sprucemoose: wod was awesome too
[6:32:39] Eraste: i enjoyed wod cause I played glad warrior LUL
[6:32:41] CitizenStef: Yep, its only up there for me because it was the time when most of my friends played
[6:32:44] nicedevill: You mean you didn't like doing ToC 4 times a week on 4 different difficulties? Lies!
[6:32:46] ImSura: bfa was uninspiring, there was nothing i cared about (lore,gameplay,gear)
[6:32:49] Vahlkor: Tow which Rarescanner is that? I like how the plate comes out in the screen
[6:32:51] ongamesog: Anyone know a fix on streaming with two monitors that have different refresh rates?
[6:32:53] Darkgx5: Wrath was one of my favs bc aswell
[6:32:54] Rizec: @Sprucemoose thats blasphemy KEKW
[6:32:54] Kisswani: @Drakenking literally the same , the moment i saw the MoP trailer i was doing spine of deathwing progression , I alt + f4 and cancelled my sub till legion KEKW
[6:32:56] gat_1000: You really are the other side of the coin lol , good to have opinions noy all xpac made for everyone. We all love the game at its core
[6:33:05] Coriollis: @GamerKillance what about Wintergrasp
[6:33:09] rajdder: @Towelliee dude how is arms warrior for pvp and mythic+
[6:33:11] Daveybutter: @towelliee do you think Blizzard will ever part with Activision for Dreamhaven?
[6:33:15] Bl4ckSauce: @Eraste they nerfed that shit pretty quick tho didn't they ?
[6:33:21] kanakawi1: legion was so good man but I disagree about wrath
[6:33:21] Vahlkor: Thanks ill check it out
[6:33:21] Darkhopp: I'd say BC and legion are interchangeable being top 2 @Towelliee
[6:33:24] Yielder89: its npcscan
[6:33:28] xaleen1: Yeah NPCscan
[6:33:37] Kisswani: LUL
[6:33:40] Rizec: ye thats a hard nope
[6:33:41] Sprucemoose: Blizzard will never leave activision lol
[6:33:44] rolando415: snowballs chance in hell lol
[6:33:45] Drakenking: @Kisswani I have no issue with pandas, I liked chen and it was one of my favorite parts of WC3, I just didnt like how the game was playing
[6:33:46] rsimpson105: Hahahaha
[6:33:48] RaegonGaming: Thats not how it works, Activision owns blizzard, they would have to sell
[6:33:49] Bl4ckSauce: Wrath #1
[6:33:50] Urebaldd: I don't think dreamhaven is really gonna do much
[6:33:59] FLManPlays: that not how it works at all
[6:34:01] Coriollis: I think he meant if WoW teams packs up Blizzard and goes for Haven
[6:34:04] Drakenking: Dreamhaven is an indie studio
[6:34:13] Darkhopp: activision would never let go of blizzard
[6:34:13] Drakenking: You guys are smoking some good reefer if you think they are making AAA games
[6:34:14] Exxcar: Also, even if Mike had the money, Activision will not give up Blizzard willingly
[6:34:14] Kisswani: @Drakenking yeah i regret missing MoP now , but back then the spine fight broke me
[6:34:17] Naskez1: Dude since morning you're in this area farming this rare ROFL
[6:34:20] Eraste: i look forward to whatever they have planned
[6:34:24] medanmarko: Wait? Bunge bought it self out. So its possible.
[6:34:37] Drakenking: @Kisswani man I quit after the first two raids I just wasnt feeling it idk
[6:34:48] Eraste: bungie's a bit different than blizzard - they're like.. hard connected
[6:34:50] Exxcar: @medanmarko Bungie wasn't making the money for them like Blizzard does
[6:34:51] Tekromancy: Bungie wasn't owned, they were in a contract. They bought out their contract. Blizz is owned.
[6:34:58] Masqerader: about time u did a wm char scrub :P been alive for like 1hr on Venture Co lol
[6:34:58] Drakenking: Implement catgirls
[6:35:00] medanmarko: @Exxcar Fair point.
[6:35:01] Coriollis: fly to Mars LUL
[6:35:05] Artivicii: pedro norte....
[6:35:05] DragonofWolves: Blizzard can't leave activision, Activision is the parent company of blizzard. Only reason Bungie bought themselves out was because of their contract. Blizzard never had that relationship
[6:35:06] Zyii_: World of Warcraft: Space X
[6:35:08] Masqerader: launch it to space?
[6:35:08] Drakenking: Elon musk would impliment catgirls and then hang out in goldshire
[6:35:09] Rizec: bring wow to mars
[6:35:14] Sprucemoose: world of spacecraft
[6:35:14] smashwow: musk will MAGA Kappa
[6:35:14] ÁÑ°ËÅ∑ÊèêÁù£: well, space station need some entertainment?
[6:35:20] TheRavenGrave: it would take me too long to lvl up all the toons i have ......ahh well

[6:35:42] MihliMage: bag man on EU in 10 min
[6:35:46] DailyChaos: wasnt legion kind of the space expansion tho?
[6:36:00] Taevenx: Are they reducing alliance WM bonus for launch?
[6:36:06] Sprucemoose: @LeonardLongNips 50 rare mount attempts
[6:36:08] Masqerader: though 100000000000 would still be better than Oceanic Servers
[6:36:10] HunchoLeo_: secure the bag
[6:36:21] hooliggan: I've got 3 but obviously can only use 1
[6:36:28] ZangLee: Are there bigger bags in Shadowlands? Or possiblity of 34 slot bags later in the expansion?
[6:36:32] Hitokiri83: they did
[6:36:38] Clicklesly: I'm still using 20 slots on some alts, quite an improvemnet there Kappa
[6:36:44] CallMeWallie: Yoooo boys
[6:36:50] Taevenx: I had read that they reduce it for xpac launch, but I'm seeing a post that just says "it will function the same"
[6:36:50] Zomgboy: you on the good side now
[6:36:53] MetallicusGaming: 2 extra slots, to store your neck and cloak
[6:37:01] Masqerader: @ZangLee 32 is still max in SL
[6:37:04] Coriollis: Toweliee random q: from what u saw in beta do you think WoW companion app will have any use in SL like it did in Legion ?
[6:37:08] Janigiv: are u gonna do naxx on wow classic @Towelliee ?
[6:37:25] rolando415: LOL

[6:37:48] Riddlz: classic takes way to much time
[6:37:52] Masqerader: Naxx comes out in SL progress.. Naxx gets cleared in 2 hours... no one cares
[6:37:54] rolando415: if you havent played classic in a while then you are way fucking behind
[6:37:56] CallMeWallie: @riddlz agreed man
[6:37:58] rolando415: thats why I gave up on it
[6:38:07] wetttnine: Yeah our guilds gonna die in classic
[6:38:09] SteLawBro: Warmode is a sham anyways. The amount of time you waste waiting for groups of horde to get done with quests makes it the equivalant to not having it on in the first place.
[6:38:11] Wcvechten: People wanted the OG experience right KEKW
[6:38:12] aribellae: @Towelliee sorry man, got in trouble from hubby for all of the orders I made forr your stuff and had to cancel my sub :( lol
[6:38:14] Riddlz: you cant really play it casualy
[6:38:18] NotDillyTV: They're just trying to give the full classic experience haha
[6:38:19] Coriollis: No changes KEKW
[6:38:23] Janigiv: remember thaddius @Towelliee Kappa
[6:38:25] thegummibearmassacre: Was sick of the stream sniping, etc
[6:38:25] Clicklesly: Naxx was fun to do in WotLK as someone who didn't do it in Classic though ^^
[6:38:27] BadFoxtrot: World buff meta
[6:38:28] Animemron: LUL
[6:38:33] billybaroo1: i didn't see naxx til LK expansion

[6:39:45] Tighron: i wish i had the time to play classic again, but it takes much more time than anythign else i play
[6:39:52] Animemron: Classic: Been there -> done that
[6:39:55] Coriollis: everyone wants BC except for a few guilds
[6:39:58] Sprucemoose: @Zomgboy he got new everything
[6:40:00] cameronmoorcraft: Yo Towelliee hows it going?
[6:40:00] Janigiv: @Towelliee are u comfrotable saying how much u payed for all those notifaiers stuff?
[6:40:01] AnonymousRedneck: Towelliee so strong he needs two damage charts.
[6:40:02] CallMeWallie: @permafrost1991 I liked the class uniqueness and identity that was in classic, and the emphasis on groups but that doesn‚Äôt work so well late game
[6:40:04] HotTahdy: retail is where its at
[6:40:12] Sprucemoose: I'm just gonna say it, if they do classic BC, I won't play it lol
[6:40:12] Q2subzero: @Towelliee with out corruption, which tank class do you think has the most burst dmg in pvp?

[6:40:29] Blvdman: 17K
[6:40:29] Autoexeq: You think Classic been a good funnel for Blizzard to get people to try Retail? @Towelliee

[6:40:32] Secondbreakfasttt: i remember that
[6:40:35] xyraxz: Do you have a google doc with tips for leveling like at the beginning of bfa?
[6:40:38] Coriollis: I would love an eco wipe and 58 lvl start for BC
[6:40:44] Assimilco: high quality
[6:40:48] Janigiv: that like a new car?
[6:40:53] Masqerader: should have just put it in amount of PS you could buy
[6:41:00] dragonsworne: @towelliee Hey I have a quesiton, I just resubbed to WOW, after boosting one of my character I went to McDonalds, ordered a McTasty as always. Got home and sat in the sofa and watch the latest episode of madalorian while eating said hamburger. After that I cleaned a bit in the kitchen and now I‚Äôm thinking about logging back into WOW. Anyways, good stream, keep it up buddy!
[6:41:02] eyemyor: I was guessing 15k, so I guess I was pretty close
[6:41:05] Permafrost1991: @olliecaulliwallie I agree I LOVED how each class was unique I really wish wow kind of went back to that class design instead of narrowed power
[6:41:16] Sprucemoose: @Coriollis that's the only way they could guarantee classic BC doesn't immediately turn into bag of shit
[6:41:23] CallMeWallie: Saaaaame! @permafrost1991 sure it wasn‚Äôt balanced but it was fuuunnn-!
[6:41:29] smashwow: @Janigiv yeah but when this is your business. you gotta spend money to make money.
[6:41:29] Riddlz: pick and choose
[6:41:31] ShortCake_BootyCrumble: PixelBob
[6:41:42] Coriollis: @Coriollis I hope they do but it will be up to players I guess... again

[6:42:49] Urebaldd: All of those with the animation, unlikely af
[6:42:58] Zomgboy: i know how hard it is frame for frame oof
[6:43:01] Janigiv: sock on head during marathon @Towelliee ?
[6:43:05] dragonsworne: So excite
[6:43:07] m_for_mandals: @Towelliee are you gonna switch off with other people like you usually do for your long streams?

[6:43:14] dusty_crusty58: What time are you starting on Monday?
[6:43:21] Permafrost1991: @olliecaulliwallie I think a big issue is that they gave every class something that other classes had, stuns, interrupts, AOE, buffs. Like what make each class unique is now watered down
[6:43:23] Sprucemoose: @Mandalstv yes he is it will be him, lula, terry and dcarter
[6:43:25] smashwow: hell if you're paying me that per job. i'll knock that shit out in a week.

[6:43:42] Janigiv: wheres the venthyr banner i wanna see it :D
[6:43:42] hoodvoker: How do you feel about Monstercat and Twitch teaming up for the $5 a month music service and auto affiliate ?
[6:43:45] Zomgboy: names flashing in and fading out
[6:43:53] callmestray: you should invest in a full screen notification for top donors
[6:43:56] FearFreak13: are you able to credit them? let us know who you hired?
[6:44:01] eyemyor: It's not "hard" work per se, but its very tedious and detailed work
[6:44:05] m_for_mandals: @Sprucemoose thanks brother
[6:44:05] DragonofWolves: @aribellae Sounds like your hubby isnt too familair with twitch, no offense
[6:44:06] Urebaldd: Then off you go and show us
[6:44:07] zigzugg: got the alpaca mount this week towPog
[6:44:12] Autoexeq: I hear a challenge coming up. Let him try. Five hours. And if he does it in time you pay him a thousand bucks. EZ
[6:44:18] Artivicii: towelliee, can u spare 3 viewers?
[6:44:19] gr0x3n: @Towelliee what @FearFreak13 said
[6:44:24] Tighron: it isnt auto-affiliate either, you still need to apply for it sepparately :P
[6:44:32] Riddlz: just currious as to why they didnt make the animation of the banners smoother?
[6:44:32] smashwow: it's a little more than that but you have have to also shade each frame. because the lighting changes per frame.
[6:44:35] Maruika: @Towelliee have you ever commisioned something and it was total shit and you refused it
[6:44:38] eyemyor: Very true
[6:44:41] XshadowturkeyX: i think affiliate is 3 viewers on avg and 50 followers for a month
[6:44:47] Ratthard: 746 attempts, next one is mount!
[6:44:51] Sprucemoose: @XshadowturkeyX that's correct
[6:44:53] rolando415: Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?!

[6:45:06] Moobot: Thanks for subscribing for 3 months, @TTVCAPIN towHAMUP
[6:45:07] Sprucemoose: Do you get a sub button with affiliate?
[6:45:11] Zomgboy: glad for them the expansion got delayed
[6:45:29] eyemyor: I could do that banner, but sure as hell not as quickly as them, and the quality would not be quite as good.
[6:45:31] DragonofWolves: Sprucemoose you do but with restrictions i think
[6:45:33] TheLoneRanger2016: now the thing to remember here is a lot of that time comes with creating the animation from scratch and coming up with how its going to move and so on. Sitting down and just copying something that is already done is a lot easier then build something from scratch.
[6:45:37] swaggitto: yea your alerts are always top notch
[6:45:42] Autoexeq: Havent seen any Kyrian flags? Or am I dumb?
[6:45:46] Sprucemoose: I imagine you get a much lower cut of the sub revenue
[6:45:53] FearFreak13: NICE got a huner of the pack with a socket

[6:46:19] Sprucemoose: But I only have enough saved up to live on for like 4 months
[6:46:20] Zomgboy: you should
[6:46:24] eyemyor: Its worth paying for the speed and quality you get.
[6:46:25] Coriollis: @Masqerader cheers
[6:46:25] ishehuman: Anybody know if I start with my main and have him farm and then switch my profession to a profession that uses Rep requirements. will the rep I gain by lvling my main transfer to my new profession like inscription when I switch?

[7:06:18] iku_tv: what do you think the top tier tanks are looking
[7:06:24] Yaluz91: well, now you gave them the idea :o
[7:06:32] PokaSword: @Towelliee there's a guild that announced that they will form a raid to gank people, they're horde and they're currently on ravencrest
[7:06:36] ramee_is_randys_dodo: @Towelliee BfA was surprisingly not bad at all at begin of xpac with warmode. You make sense , a lot of sense
[7:06:38] MisterBongwater: people forget that world pvp was a result of not having shit to do
[7:06:41] nazzari01: Same here, I want to level fast
[7:06:44] NoWaayMan: any add ons for leveling?
[7:06:47] nazzari01: What are you killing?
[7:06:52] eyemyor: @Towelliee Brock Lesnar or old school Mark Coleman? Who takes that?
[7:06:56] grizzlyhorn: this time for sure :)
[7:07:05] ramee_is_randys_dodo: Nobody gives af about ganking at start of xpac, it is leveling focus and gettign to endgame, and then the ganking begins
[7:07:11] suppstantial: I like to range dps / heal -> torn between Shaman, Priest, Druid for SL first toon -_-
[7:07:23] nazzari01: I'm going to level a shadowpriest :D
[7:07:39] b_l_i_z_z_y: BFA wasnt bad also because there weas seperate leveling zones lol
[7:07:41] eyemyor: Looks like the water sprinkler from old school Everquest clerics
[7:07:45] Kisswani: alliance and horde leveled on different continents in BfA , ofc it's not gonna be bad
[7:07:46] CallMeWallie: @irshwow me too-‚Äò I hear shamans have strong healing SL though
[7:07:47] Caynn79: @Towelliee any thoughts to shooting some BTS of your process (the marathon, prep, sending raffle winners, etc) to then make a mini doc about the life of a streamer during a major expansion?
[7:07:49] b_l_i_z_z_y: but i agree for the most part people just want tolevel
[7:07:51] PracTlKaL: are we going to be forced into dailies???

[7:08:11] fluh_: poor kyrian storyline LUL
[7:08:17] fluh_: gonna get blown thru KEKW
[7:08:18] NinjaGlovz: It all depends on how much its slowing your progress percentage
[7:08:19] SteLawBro: The amount of time you have to wait for groups of horde to finish quests diminishes any benefit you get from warmode. I've just kept it off.
[7:08:21] m__ber: yeah fuck war mode honestly, wont be worth it
[7:08:22] Rouxshoux: im nervous.
[7:08:23] b_l_i_z_z_y: like there is more opportunity to fight over mobs and stuff
[7:08:24] JonnyScotland: The way shadowlands works you need to do the quest chains anyway? or my wrong? So no point in 30% xp ?
[7:08:25] MisterBongwater: phasing game gotta be strong bliz
[7:08:25] suppstantial: @Caynn79 this would be awesome!
[7:08:26] b_l_i_z_z_y: there will be pvping
[7:08:27] nazzari01: The devs did that on purpose! The devs want to watch from the sidelines haha and see what happens
[7:08:28] CallMeWallie: Is there already a SL gearing up guide for raids available guys?
[7:08:36] QuantumleaperGG: lag
[7:08:39] Dark_Kornax: @Towelliee i think sharding should help a lot
[7:08:49] Dark_Kornax: this tech wasn't available back in WoD or Mists
[7:08:51] Bernardo994: yes warmode off
[7:08:54] Thoreya: 3 bottlenecks. The maw, origins, beginning of bastionw
[7:08:59] nazzari01: They should have had one phase, free-for-all :D
[7:08:59] XshadowturkeyX: for your first toon when you lvl your 2nd+ toon then you can choose the zones
[7:09:01] HkCelsius: the happiest players would be the one who join the game 2 weeks later
[7:09:02] BearOfLight: If it's anything like the pre-patch launch - gonna be messy
[7:09:02] Thoreya: Oribos
[7:09:03] MR_WYTE: Giggle...sharding... Kappa
[7:09:10] SteLawBro: I think warmode would be cool but i never find 1v1 fights. Its always like 1v7. Kinda pointless.
[7:09:26] surferdude5634: i appreciate it alot
[7:09:27] QuantumleaperGG: I liked the split starting areas in Wrath
[7:09:33] manmower: the world pvp at the start of an xpac is part of the fun
[7:09:39] JonnyScotland: @stelawbro or some high level flying above ganking easy targets, Why I turn it off, It's just full of raid groups ganking
[7:09:42] PracTlKaL: how many mounts do you have Towelliee?
[7:09:48] nocturnal_2195: @mr_wyte why, do you starting

[7:37:23] Samaellus: @qblayy yep
[7:37:38] Clicklesly: Glider works on this helm part apparently
[7:37:39] Thoreya: @einzbern daze/speed

[7:38:38] FatChase: That is gonna get nerfed
[7:38:48] TheRavenGrave: nice
[7:38:49] Thoreya: Fun detected in an hour LUL
[7:38:57] Eraste: i doubt they care enough to nerf a minor move speed increase on an ancient trinket
[7:38:59] Murlocz: @towelliee when gonna be ur last Nyalotha run of this expansion? Or it already happened
[7:39:10] TheRavenGrave: it would say it on the trink
[7:39:16] Secondbreakfasttt: i tried at 51 it stil works
[7:39:18] propoopimus: go bear tartar if it doesnt work
[7:39:20] N0RTV: Being Zandalari Troll with 5 % really helps then I guess :O
[7:39:34] ThatUnderAveragePlayer: That doesn't sound like a horrible deal
[7:39:41] DaProfit: i would say worth to just get ahead
[7:39:46] gamor12: yes it does
[7:39:48] steelreign0080: How'd you get that beta launcher?
[7:39:51] ThatUnderAveragePlayer: @yo6667 Maybe for someone who is slow, like you
[7:39:51] LilleM00: Still using Carrot on a stick
[7:39:59] grizzlyhorn: still works at 50
[7:39:59] propoopimus: it doesnt stop working as far as i know
[7:40:00] Scoodles91: it gives very small amout of speed
[7:40:00] SaltywankeR: old pro
[7:40:01] MetallicusGaming: So Towelliee did you manage to make Sloot take a break?
[7:40:01] Waspire: i use the flaming salmon food
[7:40:06] gamor12: do not work in 60 :D but it gives lower and lower movment speed @Towelliee per lvl
[7:40:07] Bixster: "some"
[7:40:09] grizzlyhorn: but it gives speed when you kill an enemy
[7:40:17] ThatUnderAveragePlayer: @yo6667 Me? I'm faster than a Puma. Unlike you
[7:40:18] raptorstrick: Lux had the ring and speed boots
[7:40:29] Clotic_: nerf the hell out of that food buff:(
[7:40:32] ThatUnderAveragePlayer: @yo6667 Is it bait to make a joke? Not everything is bait, I was just joshing ;-;
[7:40:37] TheRavenGrave: Do you remember the gem from MoP that Buffed you for like and hour............it still works
[7:40:41] Murlocz: Really dont care about the speed trinket, not going to rush anywhere anyway...it seems to be of those stuff for speedrunners or something
[7:40:43] WixKT: @Towelliee havent played wow in over a year. In your honest opinion is it worth coming back for Shadowlands?
[7:41:25] Murlocz: @wixkt its literally the best timing to come back
[7:42:01] NonstopCC: what trinket is it btw I just got here
[7:42:05] WixKT: @Murlocz really, is the necklace still in place and azerite power?
[7:42:19] Exxcar: @Towelliee https://www.luxthos.com/weakauras/general-weakauras-for-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands/
[7:42:21] N0RTV: @Towelliee Will the Heart of Azeroth or the legendary cloak have any meaning at all in Shadowlands?
[7:42:30] Murlocz: @wixkt it is, but it will prolly be replaced at like 57-58 lvl
[7:42:37] Murlocz: The back maybe at 60
[7:42:43] JackBlaque: lol exxcar
[7:42:43] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @Roccobro (warning)
[7:42:44] GenericFutureMan: @N0RTV I don't think it will from what I have read and heard from streamers
[7:42:45] MetallicusGaming: WixKT yes but essences and azerite traits will be disabled in SL zones (still works outside of them)
[7:42:55] Exxcar: @JackBlaque just trying to help haha
[7:42:57] nocturnal_2195: @wixkt yes but on Monday or Tuesday for eu it will become useless
[7:43:01] kofijuve: At some point someone out there has to tell the truth, i aint expecting it , but i do look forward to it. That being said, when will u tell the truth about streaming Towelliee?
[7:43:07] WixKT: @Murlocz are we not at level 120 no more?
[7:43:14] cyllos: in the group tab
