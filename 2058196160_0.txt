[0:23:27] DanielSauces: Yooooo
[0:23:27] someUFOs: from an ergonomics standpoint the top of your displays should be even with eye level when you're seated at neutral position
[0:23:44] DanielSauces: :)
[0:24:19] BryanC614: PalmBee <3 hello
[0:24:25] emopeepo: theres actually a formaula for each moniter what sistance and height is optimum for ciewing look it up ok fine

[0:25:12] ghostware9000: Secretlab is BiS
[0:25:14] gunjamma: Palm your speaking voice is ASMR - crazy
[0:25:14] Foudd: Where's the deeps!
[0:25:24] Fok_DT: @ghostware9000 True
[0:25:25] Shortiepants: you always want the center of your screen to be where your eyes would look straight forward. In any game that will speed up the process which you look at anything. That's common especially in a shooter where you don't want to have to be looking up or down to find center.
[0:25:26] chefmalice: hahaha we trolled so hard that day, feels bad
[0:25:26] quellaxx: lol that "poh poh poh" sub sound is kinda lit, is that your voice palmbee?
[0:25:31] emopeepo: i found it once i was really durprised how much it varies by screen width from an anylitical stance
[0:25:31] chefmalice: <3

[0:27:30] raijau: LU Bee Hi !
[0:27:49] Fok_DT: @Fok_DT @someUFOs Yep, just checked, you're right, top of screen on eye level, screen slightly oriented to the top
[0:28:16] BeinRAD: Get bigger eyes
[0:28:22] vivman1107: Hi Miss Bee, chat.
[0:28:22] Shortiepants: idk who said that, but it definitely isn't someone who plays competitively at any game. lol
[0:28:26] LovelyDelectables: my eyes are below my eyebrows Shruge
[0:28:34] TheEndIsNear777: welp got invited again i got shy trying to join i hesitated and then i got invited to "DIvorced Dads" i accepted XD

[0:29:46] LovelyDelectables: let me guess... cult of saturn crew? nalopiInteresting
[0:29:49] LovelyDelectables: lydiavScam
[0:29:53] Fok_DT: Doing what pro gamers do doesn't mean it's good positionning
[0:30:02] LovelyDelectables: FeelsOkayMan
[0:30:03] Shortiepants: @Fok_DT so a bunch of people who don't actually use monitors for gaming? they can say all they want but when the top 1% of players in the competitive scene line their monitor up to be center to their eyes, that's what I would suggest you do too.
[0:30:16] AgaricusBlazei: ancient humans
[0:30:24] Thuglyfe__: lack of fitness
[0:30:28] Fok_DT: They use monitors all day long for researches
[0:30:30] Fok_DT: KeK
[0:30:39] Shortiepants: 2 different things we are talking about. I said for playing games you line it up on center. if you want to talk about what feels better, then do whatever you want lol
[0:30:42] raijau: How is lvlin dooin ?
[0:30:53] Iron974: did you get the sleeping bag?
[0:30:59] Shortiepants: but to min max your monitor for gaming, it's center monitor to eye level.
[0:31:00] ulf_lundell: inventory NotLikeThis
[0:31:10] WindGain: peepoHey
[0:31:26] Iron974: cozy sleeping bag -> add 3% xp
[0:31:30] Fok_DT: Personnally i have some back issues, and i always did the center of screen to my eye level, i'll try the good positionning to see
[0:31:30] Gokublue001: lol

[0:32:00] jordy_0217: hai Palm valarHey

[0:34:02] ulf_lundell: ive been considering curved not sure
[0:34:03] EliteHDX: monkaS @rotted_
[0:34:28] Rotted_: YEP
[0:34:41] Shortiepants: but to be fair, it's actually better to have a smaller monitor cause you have to look around less if you are trying to put yourself ahead of others. especially in shooters.
[0:34:57] Numb2Every1: Love your cosplay you have on right now PalmBee!
[0:35:03] Shortiepants: @Rotted_ i assume your curved are wide as well
[0:35:13] Rotted_: 27" @Shortiepants
[0:35:14] doc_hollliday87: what up, what up how’s everyone’s night

[0:36:29] Fok_DT: Cause i can't look at minimap and what's happenning to me at the same time
[0:36:33] lepidos_: Âlo =)
[0:36:49] Fok_DT: Plus it gives me so big headhaches xD

[0:37:48] Numb2Every1: i dont eat any seafood you can eat it all @Rotted_
[0:37:48] Rotted_: ate*
[0:38:07] JTPlayaMade08: i have a ultra wide 34 inch curved monitor. it's immersive but you had to make too many adjustments for some other things.

[0:40:35] Shortiepants: @JTPlayaMade08 I think i'll be going back to a 27" shortly. I play too many shooters now to be using this ultra wide :/
[0:41:11] Gokublue001: lol yeah it's fun
[0:41:21] JTPlayaMade08: @Shortiepants i have a 27 inch 4K as an alternative but its only 60 htz. yeah 16:9 is def better for shooters for sure
[0:41:26] Aqualyt: Armada o7

[0:41:50] Aqualyt: no, i was just saluting the dead guy NODDERS
[0:42:08] Fok_DT: @Shortiepants Do same as i do, windowed mode, black wallpaper, and it allows you to just reduce the wide of the screen :)
[0:42:34] Rotted_: with ultra wide you can do 2 windows per monitor
[0:42:37] Shortiepants: @Fok_DT I can't. I know the black is there. i was forced to play that in valorant and it was TERRIBLE.
[0:42:51] Fok_DT: rly?
[0:42:52] Shortiepants: @Rotted_ this is how i use them for work.
[0:43:02] Fok_DT: On most of the games i play it do the job rly well
[0:43:16] Rotted_: NODDERS its like having 4 monitors @Shortiepants

[0:43:58] Shortiepants: @Fok_DT oh yea. I hit immortal 3 and i think i couldn't rank any higher because the black walls were just messing with me too much. it's like I knew i had more monitor and it affected the way i flicked.
[0:43:59] doc_hollliday87: do you have a valentine?
[0:44:03] Comalol: Palmbee so festive, so cute

[0:45:00] Shortiepants: if I ever yelled or got yelled at in the gym, i think I would just hurt someone. I go there to decompress, not get into drama. that's fucked.

[0:52:12] dogsenses: you're a legend @Shortiepants
[0:52:13] l7colwintersorig: it only makes sense to wake up really early due to jet lag but staying awake that late is nuts
[0:52:14] eyecolon: it's to open up armory I believe
[0:52:14] Comalol: To unlock the other 2 Sm dungeons

[0:59:18] throssome: friends are overrated
[0:59:23] MojoXan: u look amazing :)
[0:59:27] PorgeePie: You need friends to vent about chat you know.
[0:59:37] Comalol: I feel like you and Emeelzia would be such good friends
[0:59:43] STINKYFISHBOY1: is it Charlie’s birthday!?
[0:59:53] TigerArod: Hey as long as youre happy palmLove
[1:00:11] GLIFNATION: no ads woop
[1:00:12] KlobbTV: Do the friends of a streamer tend to also be streamers? Or the opposite
[1:00:15] ExactlyMF: balls
[1:00:27] STINKYFISHBOY1: emieee stops in here all the time tooo
[1:00:35] dougdaboss: have both squads link then you have a super squad
[1:00:37] joe__721: friends make you live longer
[1:00:37] Comalol: Emee and you would make such a good stream duo haha
[1:00:58] GLIFNATION: wow doing scarlet
[1:01:00] Comalol: She's leveling a hunter on SoD I think
[1:01:05] STINKYFISHBOY1: that’s what she said
[1:01:06] GLIFNATION: these were my fav lvling dngs
[1:01:21] eyecolon: people usually form friendships of others who have things in common, so streamers tend to flock together
[1:01:29] Ekimzenitram: I feel like time flies when im having fun
[1:01:36] raxeonn: dammit it's ruined
[1:01:37] raxeonn: wow 911 viewers Pog
[1:01:39] KlobbTV: @eyecolon makes sense
[1:01:42] hildobert: true
[1:01:42] GLIFNATION: I feel it
[1:01:43] l7colwintersorig: time is slower when you're alone
[1:01:49] throssome: no you lost me at hanging out with people
[1:01:49] raxeonn: 920 now sajj
[1:01:54] l7colwintersorig: i feel like time fly's when you're having fun
[1:02:02] GLIFNATION: I have a theory that the less you think about time the faster it goes
[1:02:09] GLIFNATION: so if your having fun it goes by faster
[1:02:13] Rotted_: time goes by way faster when you get older
[1:02:14] Quark_Splitter: Time is slower when you get close to a black hole
[1:02:22] raxeonn: guys I read that your perception of time speeds up when you're older
[1:02:26] l7colwintersorig: LOL
[1:02:30] raxeonn: cos every year makes a smaller part of your life
[1:02:32] Gokublue001: I feel like time just goes faster when you are having fun lol
[1:02:33] its_DavisB: Nah I'd agree with Amber. Time def flies when you're going through your own solo routine
[1:02:36] l7colwintersorig: @Quark_Splitter is that a theory?
[1:02:42] STINKYFISHBOY1: when I’m with friends I get sad when it’s time to go I’m terrible at good byes so I always over stay my welcome
[1:02:51] GLIFNATION: like one consistent memory
[1:02:54] raxeonn: @Quark_Splitter no because 1 year when you're older is a much smaller % of your lived experience
[1:03:14] shibby_cream: NotLikeThis
[1:03:20] AgaricusBlazei: interesting
[1:03:21] Quark_Splitter: @l7colwintersorig Well it's been proven. More specifically it's gravity that slows time down. That has been measured.
[1:03:23] l7colwintersorig: no
[1:03:23] raxeonn: but what if you have no frenns :(
[1:03:25] l7colwintersorig: but yes

[1:03:28] PorgeePie: palmUhhh
[1:03:33] l7colwintersorig: i get you feel like you do more
[1:03:38] TigerArod: Time is valuable so invest in it wisely since once its gone we can never get it back
[1:03:46] raxeonn: Icl every time I leave the house, it's £50. Insane
[1:03:51] Comalol: we're just npc's doing the same quests for xp irl
[1:03:55] Rotted_: pepeMeltdown
[1:04:05] Rotted_: ONE person complained
[1:04:06] STINKYFISHBOY1: 60 seconds is 60 seconds
