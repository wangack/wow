[1:33:24] c0mmander_starscream: But those damn "Reeee Casuals"
[1:33:37] strike879: ppl gonna complain about the catalyst when they dont even have gear at the point it opens
[1:33:41] Twizted23faith: what currency will it require
[1:33:46] abracka_: they all seem sorta bland
[1:33:51] Rohen86: I feel like Blizz sees completing the tier set is the finish line but for a lot of people its the starting line
[1:33:53] TheUnknowing: prot pally one is ass
[1:33:54] KyleEverett: As it stands, I will be doing 30m Normal and making sure I'm the only one of my tier token
[1:33:56] SimplyRed: i saw max rating them last night
[1:34:17] Mecabeast: mistweaver had the best set bonus
[1:34:26] SimplyRed: mistweaver had their own tier above S
[1:34:39] Scoodles91: DH tank one is good too
[1:34:56] SoldierV: boost train! towDance
[1:34:58] KyleEverett: Bear was turbo crap cause of course it is when it's a gore/mangle bonus
[1:35:16] kiwiboneq: meh 0 gameplay
[1:35:19] smelly4head: hi chat i cant decide a class in wrath, should i go mage or priest
[1:35:27] cruzeal: occolus monkaS
[1:35:37] J3ST3Rt: Good morning Towellie! Love a good stream on the weekend!
[1:35:51] SoldierV: Choosing Priest will give you the option to heal as well as DPS
[1:36:06] SoldierV: Mage is just DPS but those teleports are real nice
[1:36:06] TheCaselock: @Towelliee are Prot Pally and Brewmaster 1 and 2 for you in Dragonflight...or did another tank break into the top 2?
[1:36:07] Cyenna: wtf blood elfs cant be warriors in wotlk??? thats bs
[1:36:10] abracka_: @smelly4head it's going to come down to personal choice tbh. spriest is always needed and if you enjoy healing you have that benefit. mage destroys shit as arcane throughout the xpac and moves towards fire at the end
[1:36:21] Sherbert1492: :D
[1:36:32] Nebulizer87: def not a fan of the nerfed holy power generation
[1:36:54] LeXieSterling: Good morning. How is your day going so fare?
[1:37:20] SoldierV: fares very well LeXieSterling
[1:37:44] smelly4head: @smelly4head thats a good point, but do you think there wil be floods of mages for that reason and its hard to get groups?
[1:37:51] Scoodles91: DH one?
[1:38:04] KyleEverett: bear tank is just bad when 50% of your damage in Moonfire
[1:38:10] abracka_: @smelly4head doubtful. most people tend to roll with the melee classes (dk, warrior, mage) or hunter
[1:38:16] ArcaneMaki: What are we talking about here?
[1:38:25] abracka_: @smelly4head oops, dk, warrior or rogue**
[1:38:31] Masqerader: tier set bonuses were announced last night @SollowJP
[1:38:47] Kelticlore: @towllie how much do you think having a faction divide has affected wow in any compacity?
[1:38:48] Ezekyler: Bears can't complain, at least the tier set bonus are not Mangle does that or mor damage @Towelliee Kappa
[1:38:49] ArcaneMaki: @Masqerader Thanks mate!
[1:39:00] Ezekyler: Maul i mean*
[1:39:22] KyleEverett: Maul actually got a ton of buffs and will be used in single target, so maul may have been liked
[1:39:33] smelly4head: @smelly4head ill take your word and roll the mage then thanks
[1:39:42] TotallyNotRaien: if the 10% heal was on maul it woudlve been broken tbh
[1:39:43] Masqerader: maul would have been much worse
[1:39:49] Holysal: @KyleEverett maul still sucks
[1:39:58] TotallyNotRaien: maul is good
[1:40:04] GamerKillance: Lol reading the forums some still think "Classic+" will be a thing
[1:40:04] MILESkg21: KEKW

[1:40:23] Holysal: @TotallyNotRaien delete it from the game
[1:40:33] Masqerader: he on his way to neverland
[1:40:33] ArcaneMaki: that's why I said "Occulus OOF"
[1:40:44] SoldierV: NOcculus!

[1:46:01] NetherRegion: WOTLK was DKs, Pallys and Trees in every run
[1:46:10] ArcaneMaki: I remember playing Wintergrasp as a resto druid tree, I was an unkillable tank

[1:46:46] Jarlan23: yeah preschool is easy once youre in middle school
[1:47:01] NetherRegion: @SollowJP yuh
[1:47:17] GamerKillance: Mechanics didn't really start getting interesting until Hardmode Ulduar. Blizzard started to realize their shit was too easy and players were just getting better
[1:47:40] mavericks312: mechanics didnt matter in wrath till ulduar
[1:47:58] GamerKillance: Hardmode Ulduar" Regular Ulduar was kinda a joke
[1:48:15] mavericks312: true yea hardmode specifically
[1:48:37] Tbuck92: How do you reckon Cata heroics would be now? I always remember them being hard
[1:48:42] GamerKillance: Lol the vehicle fight
[1:48:45] mavericks312: yogg hardmode was damn near impossible
[1:48:48] ArcaneMaki: Can't believe they never really re-used Ulduar "unique" hard mode system.
[1:48:48] MILESkg21: nice LuL
[1:48:50] DaltonIRL: anything involving vehicles is a miserable experience
[1:49:18] mavericks312: it took my guild like 2 and a half weeks to get yogg 0
[1:49:39] GamerKillance: Cata classic would be pushing
[1:49:43] GamerKillance: WOTLK has to be the last
[1:49:56] mavericks312: cata will start remastered series lol
[1:49:59] GamerKillance: Then they can make it a seasonal thing with rewards to retail. Would be the best approach
[1:50:29] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: I joined a guild a week before wrath launhched, They needed another warlock and hosting pug raids with ease. After spending time with them, I don't think it's gonna be a "home" home" But moreso a halfway house...
[1:50:41] Quakezilla69: if i dungeon spam, what be the best to spam @ level 75

[2:09:54] mavericks312: ulduar late dec early jan maybe?
[2:10:51] levinegaming: Do you think classic will keep going after wotlk?
[2:11:14] cealtric: alrdy ask about cata so yeah
[2:11:16] tyler2tall89: @Hafcool 70-80 is on average 30 hours if you're somewhat efficient.
[2:11:23] mavericks312: then march we get 10.1 in df
[2:11:50] valrash1981: Dragonflight not looking good to me, probably sticking to classic
[2:11:57] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the suprise marathon is going to be before or after DF release?
[2:12:03] mavericks312: selfie cam with filters

[2:12:24] mavericks312: @valrash1981 what dont you like about it
[2:12:32] Hafcool: @tyler2tall89 Seems like I am doing something very wrong
[2:12:50] Austei: blizz like "complain about the raid 1 more time and its selfie patch no push us"
[2:13:28] AveragePvp: @tyler2tall89 Its about 4 hours a level so 40 hours to be efficient, also factor in if you are on a high pop
[2:13:40] mrelgaato: @tyler2tall89 Outlevel the zone maybe?
[2:13:50] tyler2tall89: @Hafcool most of us have already lvled this content 20 times in the past. Its like riding a bike. If this is your first time. itll take longer.
[2:13:58] shupering: Hey @Towelliee, regarding the epic edition, will a mod dm at some point? no hurry

[2:25:06] bekindtoeachothr: i should do the same ive liked warrior a lot

[5:55:10] haderdaraide: Do you think it has the grind aspect or casuals can at least go AOTC pretty well
[5:56:09] Alacardias: anyone else playing Wrath does both of the starting zones? or do you just push through as fast to 80?
[5:56:19] Ezareal: Where does the notion of tuning for the 1% come from, honestly
[5:57:14] haderdaraide: @Alacardias I came to howling fjord at 68, finished at 71, so im going back to borean to get to 72 then prob heading to dragonblight (not finishing borean I think) is my plan at least

[6:04:52] zeeAbe: Yeah the problem is that sometimes people don't understand that even if a class is "bad" for pushing the absolute limits of what is possible, it does not mean that your random +12 key operates at that level.
[6:04:55] blasticosz: @phillydilly18 paladin will always be good no matter what
[6:04:57] gorbkw: Is the Heroic lockout weekly or daily?
[6:04:58] superpudd: Its weird not seeeing ilvl on gear

[6:06:24] jswatte: people will just blindly follow a meta
[6:06:27] jswatte: sadly
[6:06:36] Buckwink: thats your IO score
[6:06:39] Peqdevil: whatever the content streamers is pretty much the gospel
[6:06:45] wildwittra: was it in Ulduar that the Block-Libram dropped ?
[6:06:50] Buckwink: if your IO score is shit idgaf what spec youre playing you arent getting in lol
[6:06:55] swampt1l: i got my own mythic + team so no longer have to pug
[6:07:26] jkitchin75: whats in the box
[6:07:34] LtDanAndHisMagicLegs: The average player doesn't usually know *why* they do something, they just know they've been told to do it.
[6:08:01] Peqdevil: I have seen 200+ IO score get kicked because they were BM and not Survival
[6:08:02] swampt1l: ive seen people who have like 2200 and still be shit lmao
[6:08:10] Peqdevil: *2000
[6:08:21] jeffnsteff2019: reminds me of days in Mop where u needed lego back just get into a raid
[6:08:24] blasticosz: 95% will follow a guide to the last sentence without asking any questions
[6:08:59] Buckwink: there wont be just one cookie cutter talent build for most specs
[6:09:21] Purgatan: Noticed on ptr that you can change talents anywhere, is that how it is going to be in DF, or just to speed up testing?
[6:09:33] Buckwink: so far most have at least two
[6:09:33] haderdaraide: really? no cookie cutter build? How so, love that
[6:09:40] Ezareal: Bears PepeHands

[6:11:05] Ezareal: pretty sure spiteful is still a thing @Buckwink it was necrotic and inspiring
[6:11:06] zeeAbe: Do I look like I know what a talent tree is?! towSweat towSweat
[6:11:15] Thunder4o: As a PvP Rsham i would need atleast 7-8 different builds depending against what comp i play in arena,people that say there will be cookie cutter build doesnt have good expriance of the game or they dont play on high level
[6:11:17] cothxd: @Ezareal this

[6:21:13] Nico_vdM: @nitemare34godd prot has a talent that that resets the duration of divine plea each time you hit a mob. so as prot you want to keep hitting things to maintain the buff

[6:50:27] feherlofia123: allied races should be baseline by now tbh. doing old questlines is like rocketscience especially to a new player
[6:50:54] poorhooligans: stopped playing SL in january ....loaded up Battlenet first time in 6 months today to see DF Beta.....curse you Blizz
[6:51:23] tiyanigean: you can unlock all of the ARs by just getting a maxlevel character of the right faction. no requirements other than a handful of arguably really good questlines
