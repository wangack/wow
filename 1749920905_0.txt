[5:40:17] loyal2thesea: So the series between donuts and perplexed is now tied (both losing a best of 3), but now perplexed just needs to win one more game to win the group? That‚Äôs strange. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôd be a reset like in fighting games for another best of 3.

[5:42:29] bapsspe: dwarf racial is another dispel
[5:42:32] atsoulgaming: what happend with echo?

[5:43:04] atsoulgaming: oh ty
[5:43:10] ChadOrc: @loyal2thesea why should it be another best of 3? makes no sense
[5:43:22] Bearman999: stockades...possibly be the fastest mythic ever
[5:43:31] SKettu_: FOR RENJI
[5:43:46] zendestroyer: Because perplexed was in A bracket

[5:44:23] aleia_llanowar: @loyal2thesea its just another way to organize a tournament. The thing is that there is little on the line in this match, both teams are qualified for globals already
