[0:38:51] 1nightplays: are sims always right?
[0:38:57] Thowarr: Better to craft shoulders
[0:39:01] StreamElements: Start learning a new language in 3 weeks with Babbel! Use my link https://bit.ly/3U7Nwcq to get up to 60% OFF a lifetime subscription!
[0:39:21] Thowarr: @1nightplays Sims are always right as long as you're inputting the correct information
[0:39:23] Lylsky: shoulders are a less volatile slot because there is only 1 potential drop you can replace the crafted one with, the mythic council ones
[0:39:26] Thowarr: IGOG
[0:39:34] SakhetEU: Isnt it better to craft boots? You lose more stats compared to 489 item on shoulders than on boots. If you get shoulders in vault next week you have to recraft again
[0:40:36] Lylsky: @SakhetEU shoulders and boots have the same stat budget
[0:40:54] SakhetEU: Oh mb
[0:41:08] Zerqo: waist

[0:42:43] julian_fmv: if there's another upgrade, i'd rather get that upgrade than a socket on a non-myth track item
[0:42:44] Mr_nUUb: keep in mind asimulation happens under perfect condition: no downtime, perfect buff and trinket usage, etc
[0:42:51] umorakii: btw @Naguura the head enchant scales with item level so if u have a 483 ilvl head the enchant will do less dmg
[0:43:23] Lylsky: boe myth track helmets are very cheap these days
[0:43:35] KlassicalKarl: new mog!
[0:43:42] loinex: heretic item
[0:44:23] hudswow: is craftin realm specific?
[0:44:31] Kuroz: easier to find a  crafter than a group for a key at this hour hmmMeeting
[0:44:43] julian_fmv: Intellect will probably sim higher than haste mastery from gem right?
[0:44:53] Lylsky: no no, it can come with a socket
[0:45:06] KlassicalKarl: its just an AH bug, when you actually click the item it will show which ones do and dont have sockets/tertiaries
[0:45:12] Lylsky: visage of devouring flame
[0:45:15] Lylsky: that's the helmet
[0:45:21] Xerotrix: its a myth track boe

[1:22:28] fedw4: it has to breath?
[1:22:29] 0ostormblessedo0: you can get cylindrical strainers
[1:22:38] bleeppblorpp: @fedw4 you want the liquid removed
[1:22:39] riotscream: use pastry doh on the strainer
[1:22:43] bleeppblorpp: it makes it firm up
[1:23:02] riotscream: any plastic on it?
[1:23:11] MissImpatience: but what kind of dough do you want to bake?
[1:23:13] Mr_nUUb: what material is the handle? all metal? no problem in the oven
[1:23:21] riotscream: parchment
[1:23:50] fedw4: great movie
[1:23:51] MissImpatience: Mürbeteig should work - don’t know how it’s called in English SeriousSloth
[1:24:05] nukemastercreampuff: you can use your screen from your mic as a strainer if it's mesh
[1:24:11] bleeppblorpp: just make a normal pie crust, then press this yogurt thing into it upside down
[1:24:15] riotscream: everything from scratch or buy pre made pastry doh?
[1:24:17] bleeppblorpp: no one will see if it cracks
[1:24:33] TotallyNotRaien: claire?
[1:24:40] loinex: WHAT smart and cooks?
[1:24:59] bleeppblorpp: but you want curved side up?
[1:25:00] bleeppblorpp: hahaha
[1:25:17] MissImpatience: or you probably don’t need to actually bake it - you can use butter cookies with melted butter
[1:25:20] 0ostormblessedo0: Make the pie crust with a bigger diameter and squeeze it in
[1:25:21] bleeppblorpp: yeah
[1:25:22] nappingdwarf: are you quiting wow to make a kitchen stream now  LUL

[1:30:15] b0vril: Do none of your friends have a tart pan?  That would work.

[1:42:27] Jack_the_Dipper: She said you could leave it for a few days in the fridge
[1:43:15] Jack_the_Dipper: make grilled cheese sandwich for Jack
[1:43:39] Kuroz: honestly you could turn it into a classic yoghurt cake worst case scenario but I know you like the dough idea now
[1:43:46] b0vril: The only issue with leaving the dough in the fridge is that it will eventually get soggy but that takes several days.

[1:50:04] b0vril: Looks like 00 flour will work.
[1:50:13] bakingbad: are you gonna stream in your kitchen
[1:50:19] Kuroz: friday

[1:54:03] b0vril: Claire was the resident pastry chef for Bon Appetit.
[1:54:06] jokuTM: Its finer flour?
[1:54:23] b0vril: Cake flour is pastry flour.  very fine and low glutin.
[1:54:23] fedw4: harder claire
[1:54:29] bakingbad: riiiight that's where I know her from, she used to remake store candy
[1:54:39] bakingbad: like homemade twix n stuff like that
[1:54:49] ottavianni: maybe it has somthing that help it to rise
[1:54:53] bakingbad: I mean gourmet version not homemade
[1:54:57] fedw4: @bakingbad snacks too
[1:55:10] Flexaxy: seems like she's making it way harder than it's supposed to be, like what
[1:55:14] jokuTM: American names are for every dumb ass. Italian flour is for engineer KEKW
[1:55:41] b0vril: no cake flour is only flour.  It is just 0000 flour used in pastry and cakes.  Also, it is lower in gluten.
[1:55:45] Zenamos72: i like watching this  " team of cooks  she is with " in the test kitchen  lots of crazy and amazing things happen and all of them are funny
[1:56:27] jokuTM: @b0vril Yeah. I think there is specific "cake mix" that has all dry stuff in it.

[1:58:47] flickflackoverduck69: mix them together then u have 000
[1:58:54] jokuTM: So there is more outer layers of the grain
[1:58:55] b0vril: Also, I see on youtube that Paul Hooywood has an apple pie recipe.  He is from England so he may have better Europe-centric measurements and ingredient names.

[2:14:21] Jack_the_Dipper: Make 6, one for each :p

[2:49:57] Highspeeds: nagura nds knife is scary remind me to not eff with her
[2:50:17] SimenT94: It's been pretty bad previous seasons, people taking other healers, even if I have like 300 score more than them xD
[2:50:54] YoshTS: Whats the meta mdi dps this time around? anything new?
[2:51:03] SimenT94: I used to get whispers like "do you really think I will invite you as MW"
[2:51:04] thundork: o7 naguura and chat
[2:51:20] entropy_reigns: MW could perform in SL, mostly. But the community perception was bad and there were so few of us. So, not many pug invites.
[2:51:26] Kuroz: 7 pm
[2:51:28] Kuroz: CET
[2:51:39] thundork: mw is really nice atm, i just wish we had a dr to use on others
[2:51:42] Kuroz: ends february 5th

[2:52:39] mistex700: hey hey
[2:52:39] Zapzoda: is that a pear or an apple
[2:53:08] TotallyNotRaien: a raw potato actually
[2:53:10] Sikari__: don't think there is a world where they don't run UH DK in MDI
[2:53:43] Sikari__: sub rogue probably

[2:54:08] YoshTS: healer?
[2:54:09] Sikari__: mage ig
[2:54:13] Tophwow: They just use Drums KEKW
[2:54:23] formation2252: Outside the box... go drums
[2:54:28] Sikari__: fire in large pulls could work
[2:54:35] YoshTS: Hunter?
[2:54:42] Candyfriend: fire is just stealing the unholy damage
[2:54:54] Tophwow: Enh is bad in mdi setting
[2:54:58] Tophwow: in great push maybeee
[2:55:01] thundork: aug maybe?
[2:55:05] Bless59360: windfury! :3 i don't know anything :D
[2:55:09] Tophwow: You need setup and you are capped to 6 targets
[2:55:16] Sikari__: @tophwow way too squishy for tgp
[2:55:19] Tophwow: you kinda do good 6 target and you dont have burst
[2:55:23] SimenT94: You don't think they go VDH, disc, Aug, mage, something?
[2:55:27] Tophwow: @Sikari__ yeh thats why I said maybeeee
[2:55:35] Tophwow: @SimenT94 Aug does no dmg

[2:55:57] Sikari__: maybe they actually take the l on the healer and run pres or resto
[2:56:03] Coresh79: enhance funnel/sustain is fine, bit squishy, main one at 150 ping and around 3k. Target cap sucks for aoe
[2:56:15] Tophwow: Do you need that on like 25s though
[2:56:15] sweet_revenge_: how do you extend the dot duration?
[2:56:17] Candyfriend: pres does big dam
[2:56:31] Tophwow: How about shaman healer tbh
[2:56:34] Tophwow: they do decent dmg no?
[2:56:35] Bless59360: solves the Lust problem ^_^

[2:57:15] Candyfriend: theyre pretty much a melee
[2:57:36] YoshTS: enh shammy?
[2:57:42] gambleragain: look guys, there's gonna be rogue mage and disc/monk for sure
[2:57:50] Tophwow: @YoshTS You dont wanna be capped to 6 targets
[2:58:22] SimenT94: is one of the meters supposed to show healing?

[2:59:44] Unstobubble_: remember last tgp ? there was a team with sp aug and enha from US. They really lacked the aoe dmg on higher keys
[2:59:45] sweet_revenge_: since when does unholy not have aoe cap? did they change something this addon`?
[3:00:06] Sikari__: pres can do good dmg
[3:00:06] EckardZii: mage got a short kick, and aoe stops, should be nice
[3:00:13] thundork: honestly why not pres
[3:00:18] SimenT94: disc?
[3:01:05] Zapzoda: brewmaster
[3:01:08] Bless59360: I'd imagine PresEvoker would be good for healing melee comps
[3:01:11] Zapzoda: pog
[3:01:11] Tophwow: Brewmaster does really good dmg
[3:01:11] Bless59360: so it's not unheard of
[3:01:12] Tophwow: actually
[3:01:13] thundork: brewmaster monkaS
[3:01:22] Tophwow: Like one of the best tanks dmg wise
[3:01:32] Candyfriend: theyre also super self reliant atm
[3:01:45] Zapzoda: brewmasters get crushed tho
[3:01:55] Candyfriend: its not high enough keys to get crushed

[3:03:56] Unstobubble_: it feels like ret pala is too strong  in middle high keys. I think it would be the carry on MDI
[3:04:28] Sikari__: ret has no prio dmg and for pure aoe it's just a worse UH
[3:05:00] zelcione: how high keys will be played in mdi now ?
[3:05:16] SimenT94: Guardian?
[3:05:19] missnicole1989: i guess the fyraleth would also be available on the tournament reals so they should calculate in  when they run on tourny realms?
[3:06:06] bluev1king: Ahahaha that was so unlucky
[3:06:09] SimenT94: I HATE that overlap
[3:06:16] TutzorTV: @Kuroz naguuraThinking
[3:06:21] SimenT94: The visual is the same
[3:06:41] thundork: its like afflicted in this place, horrible to see
[3:06:51] astreinoid: that overlap is just so inconsistent.. try with classes with spell effects like clouds around them even
[3:06:53] dimsy__: resto shaman pog
[3:06:55] Kuroz: Kuroz gifted a Tier 1 sub to TutzorTV!

[4:06:16] JohnAllenCasts: they smoothed that out
[4:06:22] Sikari__: 25 yd range is basically a melee caster

[5:24:39] Xastin3: that seems like a good judge
[5:25:13] Sebleh: @omgauss what could be faster than pushing the one button it takes to shapeshift tho?
[5:25:30] Xastin3: i just bind my forms to my mouse buttons
[5:25:35] Xastin3: and push one i want
[5:25:40] Xastin3: bear mb4
[5:26:00] glesgagaming: Hope the vault was kind to you :)

[5:26:22] MooniexVibes: I have mine keybound as well
[5:26:32] Elembry_us: I saw a resto druid spec'd into Skull Bash and it gave me so much anxiety. You have to get in melee range, cat form, them skull bash. Best you can do is macro cat form and skull bash.
[5:26:33] Saqir_: Like roar
[5:26:36] Xastin3: like if you dash in human it auto swaps you
[5:26:46] Gluxton: there is a macro that makes you switch to cat if you cant go travel form, if that's what they mean?
[5:26:49] glesgagaming: Regrowth for bear is a bastard, especially with the instant cast
[5:26:55] Saqir_: u can cancel form fast tho using /cancelform (macro)
[5:27:00] glesgagaming: smashing it can take you out of bear
