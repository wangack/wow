[5:43:34] n0rmel: is 1 tank strat and zerg only 10 man?
[5:43:42] anluchkaszn: we 1 healed a zerg with a holy pala
[5:43:59] popo187: 2 heal is pretty solid, but u need to have the hpala kite the 1st drake away
[5:44:01] FrostHitsThose: That's how you do it though. You kill it in a minute ten or so. only real healing target is the tank

[7:26:34] Str8reapin: lulzthen hes got alot more time to play then most people
[7:26:48] mrinvictus44: For leveling alts should i do story or does it not matter if i dungeon all the way through?
[7:26:54] insaniity: yeaaah Sadge it just needs more content, if you enjoy wow it's definitely better to play it over nw atm @GoatHeritage
[7:27:14] DuKeIt0uT: @thenewguy176 it's a buff indicating that when he heals with living flame that his next living flame damage on enemy will do more damage
[7:28:05] fabregamu: shroud whats ur highest arena rating
[7:28:07] sir_mudkip90: Once you finish the campaign with one character, world quests are available for alts and also you can start leveling on any of the zones, but yeah, you can spam dungeons if you want, it won't help you with renown tho
[7:28:10] flickrmbskull: Some basic healing thing you should just practice in the back of you mind is cleansing because in alot of MYTHIC + there is mechanics that if heals done clean it can be wipe
[7:28:12] Cafe0le: fun corridor Pog
[7:28:19] StillStormX: @insaniity i enjoy both for sure but definitely wow way more. just so much more to do. people who complain about not having enough to do complain about there being too much to do in the next xpac for wow

[7:29:41] insaniity: @GoatHeritage yeah same wow is just so fun and always got content, even if the past xpacs have had BS systems. And agree lmao, S1 isn't even out yet people are only doing 0's, rep and world quests
