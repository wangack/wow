[2:20:29] Spikeqc: anyone else sometimes get nightmares of being in school again? LULW
[2:20:30] sweatydawg: oda everything everything will be alright alright
[2:20:32] Chompsy: I think time management and how it's spent is a pretty good indicator on whether a teacher is bad or good personally but I guess that could be different. @christiangodwarrior97
[2:20:33] jherrera154: We're trying to hate watch here. Stop making us feel bad. om
[2:20:34] RailDemon: so anyways, fuck graycen. right?

[2:21:06] Galactic_Tactics: I'm 40 and I have dreams that I missed the school bus lol
[2:21:07] kubrick_2001: @christiangodwarrior97 I'm talking about good teachers that you didn't have, stop stereotyping all of them
[2:21:08] Falsa1122: Same LULW
[2:21:13] Spikeqc: @Spikeqc oda
[2:21:16] drontuffe: that was the worst part
[2:21:16] RailDemon: I text your mom that too :)
[2:21:20] sergogg95: My mom makes 20k a year, so I decided to become a twitch streamer with 0 content and make even less to make per feel good. @Graycen the good guy
[2:21:25] Nnatey: Graycen son debuff
[2:21:29] Thomsan04: i used to have nightmares on my days off that i overslept
[2:21:37] NispyCriblet: Can you look at the linkdin now?
[2:21:38] christiangodwarrior97: @kubrick_2001 good and bad teachers have to deal with this a ton its not about their ability its about their duties
[2:21:46] respe2ctwohma2n: i think wow should lower the monthly fee :(
[2:21:51] jherrera154: Gray didn't your grandma tune into your stream one time and you were saying some fried ass shit? KEKW om

[2:22:06] Nitewinds: yeah that's messed
[2:22:07] kubrick_2001: @christiangodwarrior97 Not if kids are starting fights and filming and yelling at the teacher and being disrespectful dude Open your mind, if the kids don't want to be there then they should go ahead and leave and rob stores
[2:22:10] thorzain22: bean is on SSD
[2:22:12] oneALMONDMILKplease: wtf
[2:22:13] Hauzser: what is the shit for if even people like her who need the help cant get it
[2:22:30] oneALMONDMILKplease: thats so low
[2:22:35] MymicArt: HUH
[2:22:38] liberatedturtle: 20k a year is less than minimum wage full time, not trying to say your wrong but that's very low
[2:22:40] RailDemon: mhm
[2:22:40] NispyCriblet: It gives her something to do
[2:22:43] Nnatey: Flirt
[2:22:43] BingoTingler: Getting on disability is insanely hard. Some states much harder than others.
[2:22:44] noosekabob: tell her to get a lawyer
[2:22:45] mAiKa_______: eww
[2:22:46] Jackietothemoon: hey little gup you have alittle nub

[2:22:49] Galactic_Tactics: @RailDemon buttsoFinger
[2:22:49] boyhasheart: waddaaaaap
[2:22:54] christiangodwarrior97: @kubrick_2001 well the kids have to be in the classroom even if they dont wanna be there so then the teachers have to deal with them
[2:22:58] Bhappy8: what job  pays 20k a year?
[2:22:58] RailDemon: @Galactic_Tactics, notxqcL
[2:23:01] grethedren: are you aware that CP stands for something else on the internet? that's right, cheese pizza
[2:23:06] thorzain22: @Bhappy8 mcdonalds
[2:23:13] respe2ctwohma2n: disability is 13k a year in Canada
[2:23:16] Jackietothemoon: @Bhappy8 graycen mod
[2:23:16] kubrick_2001: @christiangodwarrior97 teachers don't have to be there, they choose to be there they could quit anytime, that's how society works stop being so in narrow-minded and look at it from both perspectives
[2:23:18] TaseMeBro_: om
[2:23:19] BingoTingler: @liberatedturtle He probably means after taxes and insurance
[2:23:20] Thomsan04: CP? i prefer DP
[2:23:26] MymicArt: Carl Palmer
[2:23:28] Jackietothemoon: cp = cream pie?
[2:23:29] Wildboomkin: @thorzain22 no shot they would give him ssd him they seen how much money he makes off streaming, you have to report your earrnings
[2:23:31] jherrera154: monkaW
[2:23:39] Thomsan04: DP = double pepperoni
[2:23:39] liberatedturtle: yes
[2:23:46] BingoTingler: @Thomsan04 mhm
[2:23:46] liberatedturtle: mobs give a small amount of blood aswell
[2:23:47] MymicArt: Corpse Party
[2:23:49] Shungite420: except the guards
[2:23:51] MymicArt: Cyber Punk

[2:23:53] oneALMONDMILKplease: is she a teacher aide?
[2:23:55] Nitewinds: that kind of payment is criminal
[2:23:57] respe2ctwohma2n: looo
[2:23:59] LegendFromWoW: educators deserve more for sure
[2:24:08] christiangodwarrior97: @kubrick_2001 so when things get abit hard at  the job you should just quit? what are u on about lol
[2:24:11] thorzain22: i scam the government of canada for money as my job
[2:24:21] BaddestCloud: my girlfriend says that , does she get paid in 1 dollar and 2 dollar bills too?
[2:24:38] Nnatey: Wokege
[2:24:41] christiangodwarrior97: @kubrick_2001 and yes they are quiting btw
[2:24:46] Kings_Ransom_: @christiangodwarrior97 It's the same concept if 30 people rob a fucking store multiple times and the store shuts down and does not reopen because there are no more tax dollars and they don't give a fuck anymore. If kids continue to misbehave eventually, teachers will stop giving a shit and society will collapse
[2:24:47] NispyCriblet: Linkndin?
[2:24:54] Jelerman: I woke up 1 hour earlier and slept an hour later whatsup gaycn
[2:24:56] respe2ctwohma2n: we need UBI
[2:24:59] liberatedturtle: @kubrick_2001 @kubrick_2001 you need to look up elastic and inelastic demand, it's not so simple as "just quit if you're not getting paid properly lol"
[2:24:59] BingoTingler: It will never cease to boggle my brain that we pay the people that are here to protect us, save us and teach our youth the smallest amount of money. Police, Firefighters and Teachers should all have double pay and be twice as hard to apply.
[2:25:02] tonymontanaxoxoxo: Just took my monthly shower, and yes i washed my bum chat
[2:25:03] respe2ctwohma2n: this would help your mom if we got UBI
[2:25:10] Pertwizzle: yo

[2:25:19] BaddestCloud: @tonymontanaxoxoxo did you make sure to get all the way in there?
[2:25:20] respe2ctwohma2n: she worked alll her life could use 1k a month
[2:25:30] Dabufy: whatssup
[2:25:34] thorzain22: @BingoTingler police and fireman are overpaid in canada they all make like 110,000
[2:25:39] Kings_Ransom_: @liberatedturtle if you're walking into a classroom where someone is teaching you valuable information, you should sit down and respect them at least a little bit; I know all about elasticity and mental acuity and it's declining ever since iPads have been the new book for children
[2:25:39] tonymontanaxoxoxo: @BaddestCloud *waves finger around* :)
[2:25:41] respe2ctwohma2n: UBI is no tjust for lazy people !
[2:25:46] BingoTingler: I don't think Brill has guards

[2:27:00] elillama_: oda good fuckin music gupcen
[2:27:06] Kings_Ransom_: @liberatedturtle elasticity and mental acuity are both different and I am trolling you because your argument is stupid and you're not looking at both sides. Teachers have to go to college to teach fucking children that don't want to be there? I don't know schools are gross now unless it's college I don't care App state baby

[3:49:22] RushTurok: katie: During the Victorian era, phimosis was sometimes blamed for a wide range of ailments and behavioral issues in boys. It was believed that a tight foreskin could lead to everything from bed-wetting to moral degeneracy. (silence) As a result, extreme measures were sometimes taken, including painful stretching techniques or even surgical interventions, to "correct" phimosis in boys deemed to be exhibiting problematic behavior.

[3:51:22] RushTurok: katie: In certain medieval cultures, phimosis was believed to be caused by demonic possession or curses. It was thought that the tight foreskin was a result of malevolent forces acting upon the individual, leading to various superstitious rituals and exorcisms being performed in attempts to alleviate the condition

[5:09:17] glitch_flip: spongebob: today I was horny, and I saw a DVD. I thought DVDs have a tight hole and they might feel pretty good. So I put my soft pp into the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started getting harder it felt pretty good, but once I got fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in the DVD, and I had to break it in half to get it out. It was then when I flipped the broken DVD over and realized it was not a blank DVD, but a copy of the Pixar movie Up. Guess I fucked up.

You are very pressed and should not yell at the melee so much, they are only trying their best, it's really pathetic to act like this man
