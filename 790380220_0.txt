[3:30:24] REVitRevy: "In a direct appeal to investors, Trump said the stock market would “boom” if he’s re-elected. “If he’s elected, the stock market will crash,” he said of Biden. Biden said that, where he comes from, “people don’t live off the stock market.”"

[4:29:00] gritz_n_pitz: @jakenbakeLIVE Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would enact a number of policies that would raise taxes on individuals with income above $400,000, including raising individual income, capital gains, and payroll taxes. Biden would also raise taxes on corporations by raising the corporate income tax rate and imposing a corporate minimum book tax. Biden’s plan would raise tax revenue by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

[4:30:51] lazerlemons: no
[4:30:59] lazerlemons: it's uneven depending on how income is earned
[4:31:01] AbominableFro: only what's over 400k
[4:31:17] lazerlemons: no investment income?
[4:31:20] AbominableFro: so if you earn 450k, only that last extra 50k would be taxed at the higher rate
[4:31:22] lazerlemons: brokerage accounts
[4:31:39] sneakysnakx: ya capital gains if you sell investment for profit
[4:31:40] TrueDrag0n: jnbMM
[4:31:41] AbominableFro: yeah, that's how our progressive tax rate works
[4:31:48] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @be_nice_dude (warning)
[4:31:49] gritz_n_pitz: Imposes a 12.4 percent Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (Social Security) payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. This would create a “donut hole” in the current Social Security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed. Reverts the top individual income tax rate for taxable incomes above $400,000 from 37 percent under current law to the pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of 39.6 percent
[4:31:52] gritz_n_pitz: under current law to the pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act level of 39.6 percent. Taxes long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the ordinary income tax rate of 39.6 percent on income above $1 million and eliminates step-up in basis for capital gains taxation.[2] Caps the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 28 percent of value for those earning more than $400,000, which means that taxpayers earning above that income threshold with tax rates higher than 28 percent would face limited itemized
[4:32:01] DegenJT: democrats always had to revise tax code after the republicans f'd up the deficit..
[4:32:10] lazerlemons: Gritz got it

[4:33:26] TrueDrag0n: @gritz_n_pitz I have the memory of a goldfish. Wait.... Quick one what?
[4:33:39] be_nice_dude: basically, from 0-10k you pay 10% on that 10k. 10-40k, you pay 12% on the 30k, etc etc up until 500k+

[4:35:21] gritz_n_pitz: @PocketCrab Yes sir jnbTasty
[4:35:23] dailycheckpointtv: because i'm confused -_-
[4:35:35] gritz_n_pitz: @jakenbakeLIVE one more, Since our original analysis, the Biden campaign has clarified that it will hold harmless taxpayers making under $400,000 from tax increases associated with the proposed 28 percent cap on itemized deductions. We have modified our modeling of this proposal so that filers with less than $400,000 can take the full value of their itemized deductions but those above that threshold have the value of itemized deductions capped at 28 percent.
[4:35:37] shmedddy: PepeHands
[4:35:44] choobafier: is this retail?
[4:36:13] lazerlemons: If they reintroduce the unlimited SALT tax while leaving the AMT irrelevant, it will be a big tax deduction for those who have high earned income but are under 400K
[4:36:30] be_nice_dude: no no. you dont understand tax
[4:36:33] sneakysnakx: @gritz_n_pitz can u do my taxes
[4:36:34] WakeAndJakeOTL: ur a streamer, u jsut take a month of iff u get to 399k
[4:36:35] be_nice_dude: its in brackets
[4:36:36] choobafier: i thought u onyl got taxed for the money over 400k not all of it if u went over 400k
[4:36:36] gritz_n_pitz: Get receipts everywhere you go Jake KEKW @jakenbakeLIVE
[4:36:36] CallMeAyAyRon: @gritz_n_pitz, Isn't also it's only the amount OVER 400k has increased taxes?
[4:36:45] be_nice_dude: you still get taxed the same on the 399k
[4:36:45] CallMeAyAyRon: Yeah brackets
[4:36:55] be_nice_dude: so you still want to earn as much as possible
[4:36:58] watsupyouguys: i voted for Forsen EleGiggle
[4:36:59] lazerlemons: only on income above the bracket
[4:36:59] sneakysnakx: guys unsub so jake doesn't make 400k Kappa Kappa

[4:37:15] CallMeAyAyRon: No
[4:37:16] haskiii: no
[4:37:17] AbominableFro: no
[4:37:19] Inver_Z: no
[4:37:20] gritz_n_pitz: @CallMeAyAyRon Yes but there are deduction caps for 400k under and over
[4:37:22] be_nice_dude: you dont get penalised for earning more. no.
[4:37:24] RaSZis_Blue_Ball: no
[4:37:27] CallMeAyAyRon: 399k is taxed at say 30%
[4:37:33] Kefinbro: just got done filing out my ballot though
[4:37:35] CallMeAyAyRon: the extra 1000 is then taxed at 35%
[4:37:35] be_nice_dude: you just pay more tax on what you earn over 400k.
[4:37:38] CallMeAyAyRon: or whatever
[4:37:38] GodsFaithInHumanity2: stuff after 400k only applies to 400k+
[4:37:41] AbominableFro: you'd get to keep like $600 of that extra 1000
[4:37:44] CallMeAyAyRon: Yeah
[4:37:45] be_nice_dude: so from 400k - 500k for example
[4:37:54] CallMeAyAyRon: you got it Jakey boy
[4:37:54] WakeAndJakeOTL: o
[4:37:54] lazerlemons: My brother works in cali and will be in the higher bracket, it will largely be a wash until like 750k for most couples
[4:37:58] be_nice_dude: yeh you got it man
