[0:44:03] Savvasthekiler: i dont know, this might be a hot take, but i think Asmon is just looking for any excuse not to play the game! I honestly think that if Blizzard did every single one of the changes he wanted in Raids, he would still find a way to complain about it and he would quit again after 1 month max!

[1:48:00] CeruleanStar: i think if you can reach your corpse on a new char you shoujld be able to legacy loot it lol
[1:48:54] essadis: i kind of wanted dead player bodies to be lootable. and the loottable is based on what's in the bags. not equipped gear
[1:48:55] Necrothia: Thats why i have a bank toon :D for my gold :D
[1:49:00] MosesPoe: you can't control who loots your corpse, Diablo 2 hardcore allowed you to take everything from dead bodies
[1:49:02] geokouts: make  a bank alt :P
[1:49:03] Felldoh_: Give a mouse a cookie...
[1:49:04] Nuggetslug: with everyone making bank alts for safe keeping, I wish they streamlined that into some account-wide bank tab
[1:49:09] abracka_: next thing we know we have a "one redo button" and can rez once
[1:49:17] Sarocus: not even the tip
[1:49:29] ross785: Looting the bags back would be clutch lol
[1:49:34] essadis: bank alts are like life insurance or roguelite element

[1:50:42] TheCheeseWheel87: same
[1:50:42] delavor1: agree
[1:51:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: It could be useful to have a 60 for Classic+, true
[1:51:27] borisl0vehammer: They have HC PVP servers?
[1:51:29] GrovekeeperTV: whats the tts addon?
[1:51:32] Twizted23faith: choke on that pie billy

[1:51:58] essadis: at lvl 20, you can get an ear from them
[1:52:03] CeruleanStar: i think BG's are disabled
[1:52:04] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @GraviticVoid (warning)

[1:52:40] Djulio: @Duekov for retail it is, I believe
[1:52:43] Scarhearth: Did the skull rock pally die?
[1:52:55] GraviticVoid: @GrovekeeperTV VoiceOver (Classic) is the addon which vocalizes the quest dialogue.

[1:53:11] Nokterian: His clickbait is working though
[1:53:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: Clickbait LUL
[1:53:38] KaisenSiru: Clickbaits Pog
[1:53:40] GrovekeeperTV: does it work on retail?
[1:53:49] Scarhearth: I call that Ragebait
[1:53:50] cipusanx: `he does has the best lore videos out there, ngl
[1:53:57] MosesPoe: what if while bodies are still on the ground within like 10-15 minutes, they had something you could loot, to turn in, turn in enough, get an achivement of remembrence or some shit lol
[1:53:59] Felldoh_: Algorithm driven content requires click bait titles...
[1:54:23] jerseyfive: thats how i unsub :)
[1:54:27] GraviticVoid: @GrovekeeperTV I believe it's only designed for vanilla content, since a large part of retail already has voices.
[1:54:28] CeruleanStar: there is a really good veritaseum video on the effectiveness of clickbait
[1:54:31] Speshulist: then people yell at him in comments and his videos go up again
[1:54:40] Nokterian: having a ridiculous thumbnail works as well
[1:54:43] KaisenSiru: anniesWrite fandyNote
[1:55:14] kellevaran: i like the trend where youtube recommends videos where huge ending of game spoilers are in title from 20 sub dude 2 days after game release
[1:55:17] MosesPoe: at the end of the video, you're all "no, it's not"
[1:55:18] LSBreed: Is surprising after this long that he hasn't become the boy who cried wolf.
[1:55:21] LordViltor: What do you think of New world? Did you try it?
[1:55:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: Those comments, even the negative rage comments, they seem to help the algorithm
[1:56:02] kokochris: He was day one new world.
[1:56:17] DunzoCD: New World <3 such a cozy game
[1:56:21] JaeDee: last night i was giving hc a try and im 14 on my hunter a random came up and gave me 40g lol

[1:59:17] Cabbageman007: duckTU

[1:59:34] abracka_: castle of steel was like, next level toxic
[1:59:41] c0mmander_starscream: It's PUBG chat
[1:59:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah those people are teabaggers

[2:33:53] Omnadren: I was leveling my warrior through Pandaria, and I was surprised that those fish people are not allied race, but then again maybe allied races were not a thing in Pandaria @Towelliee
[2:34:01] Felldoh_: I know it will never happen, but with the success of the support evoker I'd loke to see a bard class or spec added
[2:34:11] kredal: SKY PIRATES
[2:34:11] kimmo_gaming: Iridikron is searching for pirates LOL

[2:35:22] ewoksmoonwalks: gotta go underground to fix the giant sword issue
[2:35:41] N3llee: Given how much it sounds like they want to repair the world from Cata's break it would likely be a good time "repair or help azeroth heal". So a story line where we meet Azeroth in a being form would be my guess
[2:35:54] Effin_Steffin: Vasjhir 2: Electric Boogaloo

[2:37:02] Sarocus: People have been saying pirates ever since Wotlk
[2:37:05] abracka_: you weren't here to refute it
[2:37:11] N3llee: it was in response to the twitter post WoW twittter made promoting the new xmog and 6 month bundle thing
[2:37:27] toobaked1987: People watch Bellular?
[2:37:27] TheZofren: I think people thought it would be pirates because of the nightsquall short story
[2:37:29] Sicknessqt: Which leak video LUL he has 100
[2:37:32] Omnadren: think Void expansion? Not sure
[2:37:37] ArcaneMaki: Bellular, what a joke of a man :D
[2:37:43] TheZofren: bellular had like 5 different ideas
[2:37:45] CeruleanStar: that thing iridikron took from galakrond was void stuff... so if it's not resolved this xpac then
[2:37:52] 3663Sharad: @Towelliee His "leak" based on the shop promotion stuff which was priate heavy
[2:37:59] 3663Sharad: like the Dragonpack back in SL
[2:38:01] mavericks312: Saying a void xpac is kinda an easy way out
[2:38:14] HoffaFiles: Shadow priest time to shine seqEvil
[2:38:15] ArcaneMaki: Who is trapped in the sword again?
[2:38:16] rilefors: @sollowjp in what way?
[2:38:28] kimmo_gaming: thats why she was trapped in a dagger, but by who, we dont know
[2:38:57] stratiss: i mean it's all speculation he doesnt for fun
[2:39:00] Chillexce: Didn't they changed the info on the official site for the draenei? Prophet Velen was talking about an upcomming battle between the Light and the Void?
[2:39:00] 3663Sharad: Dagger not sword
[2:39:06] stratiss: does it*
[2:39:07] ArcaneMaki: @rilefors he always pretend to know for clicks.
[2:39:09] kimmo_gaming: yes, thats shadow priest wep in legion
[2:39:20] N3llee: Belluar and team are busy dealing with the DMC strike from Blizz Korea about the low attendeence event they had there.

[2:40:18] ImLazyAF: do you guys think azeroth is flat
[2:40:22] Sicknessqt: DF cinematic was very boring to me
[2:40:23] 3663Sharad: @Mauraderss towTinfoil  KEKW

[2:45:59] Wrizzik: I'm still scarred from wireless mice. All wires when I'm at a desk.
[2:46:11] oldcrankybeard: what's the mod you are using for the quest text thing i see in the top left of your screen?
[2:46:11] Molvonos: The CTR helps immensely with links.
[2:46:24] Mauraderss: Just a click isn’t a bad deal at all
[2:46:27] HoffaFiles: I have one of those RAMs in acryllic from a friend that works there, neat paperweight
[2:47:07] Its_Garix: is that with all partnered links or certain ones?
[2:47:10] Molvonos: It's also the fact that the companies can see people showing interest in either the product, the streamer, or both.
[2:47:18] grimgamer77: I do own the corsair scimitar wired 12 button mouse, its good.
[2:47:22] Molvonos: So then they start trying to figure out how to convert people.

[2:48:25] Wrizzik: @Towelliee it was a little grainy but I think it's because you had the camera in tight

[2:55:46] MMOrpgPrincess: See the little window on his screen?
[2:55:54] MMOrpgPrincess: Says 'deathlog'
[2:56:04] MMOrpgPrincess: That also does the announcements at the top.
[2:56:09] Speshulist: best thing I just found was that Death Log lists  what the person's last words were before.  Guy on top right now says "who wanna group lvl" LUL
[2:56:27] Kavieonn: MMOrpgPrincess  got it so the announcements are a mod but this is a blizzard hardcore
[2:56:32] MMOrpgPrincess: @Speshulist OMG, I know! It's hilarious!
[2:56:49] Woider001: Good luck getting to 60, it gets real buttclenchy in the 50's
[2:56:53] N3llee: Just a random thought... it kinda rubs me the wrong way when streamers put up a tip goal asking for help getting to Blizzcon but the day before they spend $1000 on in game skins.
[2:56:57] MMOrpgPrincess: Ya, the server is Wow's official HC, but the addon is made by a person.
[2:56:58] undesiredname: you can do darkshore till 15 easily i think
[2:57:23] N3llee: o is that the difference.
[2:57:27] N3llee: that makes sense to me
[2:57:36] Its_Garix: people talk without knowing how streaming works lol
[2:57:43] N3llee: maybe i feel less rubbed about it
[2:57:44] Omnadren: @Towelliee do you think that wow streamers will return for 10.2 or nah? People like Xaryu, Mitch and so on?
[2:58:10] MMOrpgPrincess: Toweliee, did you start today on Defias?
[2:58:13] JaeDee: if u tip they can spend it on whatever lmao

[3:31:20] btd_kam12: 1 raiders from btd_kam12 have joined! 
[3:31:24] MiteMice: Here’s a question. For you guys. I have lots of PTO and I want to get into streaming. Should I take a break from work and give it shot for a month and start learning how everything works?
[3:31:35] jonsnow518: it has to be random
[3:31:47] Molvonos: If we could do that, Sol would win more giveaways.
[3:31:51] Lulaboo: the way it has to work is that there needs to be a way to enter for free. And then you can also add the other stuff
[3:31:53] Molvonos: Instead of being sad.
[3:31:57] Wrizzik: @MiteMice your call but it's more about consistency than a one-time blitz
[3:31:57] SynistorTV: @MiteMice full blast at the start? wouldnt recommend.
[3:32:00] ThorH13: any giveaway you have to have at least a free option to enter
[3:32:00] Roobi_doobi: do you think a camera is required to be successful in streaming?
[3:32:07] danoh_64: how did you get keem banned?
[3:32:13] NiteshadezTV: Gonna take a lot longer than a month to tell if you can be successful at streaming or not
[3:32:17] jerkchickenpapi: @mitemice I would learn how to do it first and work with your work schedule
[3:32:17] NiteshadezTV: Especially today
[3:32:37] Cicvara1: without mentioning any names, were there any sponsorship opportunities that you declined in your past that you wish you didnt? @Towelliee
[3:32:43] NiteshadezTV: Streaming market is over saturated. Everyone and their mom wants to do it.
[3:32:46] legendarylary: totally read it
[3:32:47] Lulaboo: Twitch streaming is a grind that will take much longer than a month to have a good foothold
[3:32:53] Beastafied: @roobi_doobi no its not required to be successful. It's an option
[3:33:06] mintchip80: its to hot in elwynn, balls was hot
[3:33:07] Turco11: even though its shady as fuck....is it technically illegal to have viewbots?
[3:33:13] MiteMice: Okay cool. I can do that for sure. Stream a few hours a day after work and start that way. I do believe that will probably be a much better idea.
[3:33:13] jonsnow518: thats why candy bar company always say to purchase necessary
[3:33:19] affuff: Not really Roobi, but nowadays impossible almost
[3:33:20] jonsnow518: no purchase
[3:33:36] Woider001: Oh that's OG FFXIV too

[3:57:26] Sollice: No
[3:57:30] Sollice: You dont NEED a mixer
[3:58:02] jerkchickenpapi: They trying to become DJs
[3:58:09] SynistorTV: 10000%. My audio literally always needs tweaked in some way or another.
[3:58:11] johnbacon9: ganggggggg
[3:58:19] Fifaholic21: You think classic+ is possible ?
[3:58:38] jerkchickenpapi: Do you need two computer to stream? And why is that some streamers use two computers?
[3:58:41] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Yeah, Classic+ is Cata
[3:58:49] roflpotamus: need cata classic
[3:58:50] chrisrev: dungeon finder in classic would be huge
[3:58:53] sniperpotion: Whats classic plus?
[3:58:59] reggiepowa: they dont need a big team to release full expansions in classic style?
[3:59:07] Wrizzik: it's a money machine because the overhead is so low
[3:59:07] toobaked1987: 250+ and HC overshadows it HUGE
[3:59:11] OGSpacely: classic with new content
[3:59:15] NiteshadezTV: No thank you for queueable dungeons

[4:00:07] Milanesa_De_Pollo: would be weird to get an underground zone in both classic and retail at the same time
[4:00:14] Fifaholic21: idk i think classic rn have more people than retail.Retail is dead you looking for high m+ keys and you cant find in que
[4:00:15] sniperpotion: Let them cook
[4:00:15] khallfrodo: @Khlar0 Bedankt voor het Cadeau-abonnement!
[4:00:26] pachadams: if they go up to classic legion.. i defenitly gonna play lolol
[4:00:28] silentknight190: No fuck classic cata
[4:00:28] Eviltuna13: We have to suffer through Classic Catta to get to Mop and im ok with that
[4:00:34] Wrizzik: TBC faction mounts I think
[4:00:35] jerkchickenpapi: @syllvn that makes sense thank you
[4:00:38] Molvonos: Flying mounts I imagine
[4:00:45] TweektheProphet: I mean once they sent out a survey asking about classic cata it kinda was a given
[4:00:48] Wrizzik: ah right, flying mounts
[4:00:51] NiteshadezTV: They removed the note that says it can only be used in Northrend. Which means it can be used in Azeroth (Cata)
[4:00:54] Akermay: The text removes Northrend requirement. Suggests flying in non expac content
[4:01:01] NiteshadezTV: & Outland*
[4:01:33] Eviltuna13: I'm having a blast level up a druid in Wrath
[4:01:34] TheZofren: so when would classic+ even happen?
[4:01:42] KronasKG: Then they can say based on community feedback.... even if only 30% were down for it
[4:01:44] Fifaholic21: The only good thing from cataclysm was raid exept dragon soul and new system raid finder
[4:01:52] NiteshadezTV: if Metzen is behind Classic+ it'll be a success
[4:01:56] TweektheProphet: do you think the do Cata but alter the timeline to make it actually classic +
[4:01:57] Fueldx: What server are you on? Trying to decide between warlock or rogue
[4:02:10] 3663Sharad: I'd imagine Metzen still has old lore pads somewhere in his house for the original content planned
[4:02:11] Broomba: would classic + be like a true vanilla server when it was released or modified?
[4:02:25] big_blunders: Chat, whats the leveling bar at the top of his screen called
[4:02:33] ItsNobbie: Considering how fast you can level a toon in retail, I think it's only logical to make HC available in retail, too
[4:02:40] infektyd: no mop classic?
[4:02:41] wEiRdO_dUdE: A lot of people wanted dungeon finder
[4:02:42] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Wrath+ would be better, and keep it that same Classic style of gameplay

[4:04:17] jerkchickenpapi: Why would they bring back classics for expansions that released a few years ago? Is it even really classic?

[4:08:52] geokouts: on the next expantion they SHOULD mka eold content available like old-school Sholo
[4:09:05] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Don't you think that will be too many versions of WoW out there?

[4:09:23] sniperpotion: Yo how do i start adventure mode on an alt after finishing dragonflight on my main?
[4:09:23] Spoonzzy: I just wish that if they put out cata they wouldnt remove the wrath servers

[4:09:46] belicaldron: LFR was a huge help when you live in Oahu in its very quiet timezone
[4:10:17] MoonwalkingAngel: i want a tbc seperate servers to
[4:10:18] Kakotan2143: EQ Has several types of servers and they have progression classic servers so i dont see why WoW cant follow suit
[4:10:19] Spoonzzy: Yeah thats what I mean @cipusanx I wish they lefft the other expansions there too
[4:10:26] Fifaholic21: When lfr realease just look how many people quit the game
[4:10:28] pachadams: LFR did kill wow..
[4:10:37] pachadams: made all the badies think they where good by clearing raid
[4:10:52] Kakotan2143: they should have a seperate server for each Expack

[4:11:21] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Casual/LFR Andies are the reason the game is running
[4:11:28] DunzoCD: or people looking for transmogs spamming 1 button on their 440 chars LUL
[4:11:29] mayhemguy: me!
[4:11:35] Kakotan2143: Yep!!
[4:11:45] toobaked1987: People with too much free time cannot comprehend casual wow players.
[4:11:46] MisterPeace: lfr made people get used to raiding, it encouraged rading for sure
[4:11:56] ArcaneMaki: Amen
[4:11:57] TweektheProphet: I do wish they would bring back guild perks
[4:12:14] Kakotan2143: ME too!!
[4:12:17] silentknight190: Gameplay and story lazy, all the classes feel the same
[4:12:18] dimofodi: mass summon forever
[4:12:21] raldrik: without LFR I would never get to see the inside of raids. I almost wish they had LFR easy, normal, heroic
[4:12:27] N3llee: yea but that gold bank perk broke the game
[4:12:28] NiteshadezTV: Guild halls? Please!?
[4:12:30] jerkchickenpapi: Guild perks were great

[4:13:03] dimofodi: I stopped playing in Siege pre-patch and came back in BFA and found out mass summon was gone and i was miserable
[4:13:11] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They said housing would cost a raid tier or more
[4:13:17] toobaked1987: Why a house in WoW? Why is that kind of realism needed in an mmo?
[4:13:22] HaxzorJimDuggan: where is the dance studio
[4:13:28] dynasstone: boring content made like  mobile phone is what killed wow
[4:13:38] Honvar: They should bring archeology back :)
[4:13:38] DunzoCD: I hope, I actually loved garrisons but they did make they world less populated since people were in theirs alot
[4:13:43] Milanesa_De_Pollo: I can't wait to see the new class in 11.0
[4:13:51] TomsLetsPlay: imo housing means no raid that tier or 2 as they will pump their resources into it.

[4:15:47] NiteshadezTV: @2wentyx4our Nice bait
[4:15:52] belicaldron: I miss class quests, Paly was the bets
[4:15:54] belicaldron: best
[4:15:55] Decree22: competition is good
[4:15:59] geokouts: a quest for a spell that you cant use in HC ONLY for pets :P
[4:16:00] belicaldron: mounts and mace
[4:16:12] SonofHorus82: best part about this quest is that the final reward is Redemption, which is totally worthless in HC.
[4:16:22] Kakotan2143: They just came out with a new class, i doubt they will do it again so soon
[4:16:34] MedicineMan: lol
[4:16:39] DunzoCD: usually theres an expansion between classes

[4:17:02] ashwing_: wtf was that human doing at lvl 1 in Blasted lands KEKW
[4:17:02] TweektheProphet: we def are not getting a new class in 11.0 we just got one in DF going to have to what till 12
[4:17:53] SonofHorus82: that could have been someone testing their deathlog.
[4:18:03] MackPlays: We got a new race and class
[4:18:18] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Yeah, but they skipped giving a class in Shadolwands, which is why we got one this expansion
[4:18:20] Voidheim: maybe 11.0 will include more support specs
[4:18:26] jerkchickenpapi: Wait what was the new class? I thought DH was the last class
[4:18:27] DunzoCD: if anything maybe DH gets a third spec but thatd be it towCopium

[4:19:11] d2darkalliance: @towelliee then do you think demon hunter get third spec and What You think/would like too see that to be?
[4:19:16] ashwing_: @jerkchickenpapi Seems youve been away for a while
[4:19:40] Karn1987: just a strait up bard
[4:19:43] jerkchickenpapi: Yeahhhh I haven’t played since Legion lol @ashwing_
[4:19:51] sniperpotion: I boosted my shaman to 60 and says i cant use heal spec?
[4:19:55] Milanesa_De_Pollo: A new class gets added each odd expansion, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, but Shadowlands didn't get one and we got it in 10.0, so we should get one in 11.0
[4:20:03] Epiclurker27893: @jerkchickenpapi Evoker in dragonflight
[4:20:05] Aro725: Hot take, I hope they give augmentation the gladiator warrior treatment
[4:20:11] kimmo_gaming: priest or shaman for sure
[4:20:14] Voidheim: agreed
[4:20:25] Voidheim: 4th spec is already a thing thanks to druid
[4:20:29] raegkwit: rework enhance shaman to support
[4:20:29] cipusanx: `shamans and paladins were a support class back in the day
[4:20:33] stormwindchill: will there be hardcore classic versions of every expansion?
[4:20:34] NiteshadezTV: Just delete Aug kthx
[4:20:40] DunzoCD: i could definitely see a DH support spec maybe D3 double xbow style or something
[4:20:42] Molvonos: Gladiator Warriors were a talent choice in the prot tree, not a full blown spec.
[4:20:45] Baromega: my money is on like 3 more support specs getting added to classes instead of a new class. And Blizz fully commits on 1 tank, 1 heal, 2 dps, 1 supp as new standard
[4:20:51] TomsLetsPlay: @Towelliee I would love a buff class like the Bard on RIFT for example.
[4:20:54] Voidheim: @stormwindchill not likely
[4:20:54] Roobi_doobi: as an aug main, i would hate to see it go away
[4:20:57] NiteshadezTV: @stormwindchill Probably not
[4:20:58] geokouts: WoW return to Draenor!!!
[4:21:00] Sollice: @DunzoCD Dont confuse the two different types of demon hunters
[4:21:03] Longiboi: fuck it make Survival a bard, and feral druid some kind of dancer. No1 plays them anyway
[4:21:08] Sollice: Aug isnt going away
[4:21:30] DunzoCD: @DunzoCD i was more just going that route cuz itd be easier for blizz to implement LUL
[4:21:48] kimmo_gaming: yooo, Mojito time LOL
[4:21:48] Voidheim: mmmm Lime
[4:22:01] dimofodi: i may not agree that they did it mid expansion/tier/wahetever but it's kind of a good litmus test "do we actually need to wait for expansion launch to do a big addition like spec or even whole class"
[4:22:02] Sollice: And they definitly SHOULD NOT make any more support specs until they feel 100% confident where Aug is

[4:22:42] SonofHorus82: yeah they're an early game today.
[4:22:44] Moobot: The Official Towelliee Hammer of the Archangel clothing collection is now available and in stock! Grab one before they are sold out @ https://towelliee.com/merch
[4:23:07] MackPlays: More support specs would fix the problem. Then aug is less centered around and meta has more options for support
[4:23:24] xrandomdoodx: all they need to do is make Aug have higher personal DPS, but buff the whole raid but for way less of an amount imo, and make the buffs have diminishing returns for each Aug added. @Towelliee
[4:23:24] Mecabeast: have you guys decided if youre bringing 1 or 2 aug for prog?
[4:24:19] Aro725: I can’t wait to see rwf guilds show up with 4 aug evoker s and just absolutely melt bosses

[4:31:42] silversoidier: does origin pc still have deals?
[4:31:52] TweektheProphet: i don't blame them for doing it , they need the win

[4:34:55] joeyporter55: I’m new to esports can anyone point me to a good place where I can learn the history
[4:35:16] TweektheProphet: i think the problem with esports is Covid over inflated the numbers and now we are seeing a return to what it probably was suppose to be
[4:35:24] joeyporter55: Newb to esports and would love to learn more - where can I start?
[4:35:45] Lulaboo: From what I can understand (and this is clearly just speculation) I think liquid poached the guild
[4:36:41] Lulaboo: I think liquid poached Limit from Complexity
[4:36:43] SynistorTV: @joeyporter55 if you wanna learn the actual history, try youtube bud. search something like "History of eSports"
[4:36:46] 3663Sharad: from Complexity
[4:36:48] 3663Sharad: i guess
[4:37:03] Nokterian: Liquid is everywhere in the world
[4:37:41] joeyporter55: @synistortv Cool thank you - any good YouTube channels to sub to

[4:38:04] Scoopachip: that wont be for another 5 years
[4:38:16] idkEric_: Riot mmo Aware
[4:38:34] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Still like 5 or 6 years from Riot MMO
[4:38:39] CloudPants8081: towCopium
[4:38:42] Nokterian: Ghostcrawler gone
[4:38:53] SynistorTV: @joeyporter55 i dont really follow any esports so I wouldnt really know about specific channels. sorry man
[4:38:55] mayhemguy: where did they go

[4:39:19] ZeusDNA: ZeusDNA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months! Morning Hammer Squad!
[4:40:07] valianya: Liquid is big enough with teams across games across the world and one team doing subpar is a hit they can afford to take.  Plus Max's team is their investment in the MMO scene and they are winning or top three every RWF
[4:40:18] TheZofren: I feel like riot really wanted an MMO targeted at the f2p/asian market and ghostcrawler didn't want that
[4:40:19] Nokterian: Good example
[4:40:24] Nokterian: love that movie
[4:40:25] Strifelol: The problem with MMOs is that they aren't super popular as they were before and also it's so hard to compete with WoW and even FF14
[4:40:29] mayhemguy: the guy from Sweet Home Alabama?
[4:40:35] d2darkalliance: @Towelliee from what I got it from ghostcrawler his biggest issue was not able to work from home anymore and be on office didnt suit his life anymore
[4:40:58] joeyporter55: I can’t stand football so I am gonna try to get into esports
[4:41:01] Sollice: Ghostcrawler probably didnt make WoW and Riot does
[4:41:09] ShadowAurelia: i have 10 cent in my pocket
[4:41:24] joeyporter55: @towelliee I appreciate your nice calm demeanor and ease here
[4:41:27] zanthoor: @Towelliee Or it could be that Riot has a different vision for the game beased on League universe and Ghost had a different opinion which did not allign with Riot
[4:41:31] Mecabeast: yeah with having tencent as a supporter i feel its a high chance the riot mmo will be f2p but have alot of microtransactions
[4:42:05] Molvonos: Some weird tribalism

[4:42:18] SynistorTV: @Mecabeast most def. Riot are pros at the F2P microtransaction path. so I doubt the MMO will be any diff
[4:42:19] inj0shwetrust: gotta assume there was an issue with the common variable
[4:42:21] inj0shwetrust: Riot

[4:43:22] TweektheProphet: tencent loves their microtransactions
[4:43:31] inj0shwetrust: Not saying thats 100% but I mean.... when you have the same outcome in multiple instances and one constant variable.... thats usually where the issue is.
[4:43:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: LUL
[4:43:45] zippit420: b2p KEKW
[4:44:30] IgneousLion: what id miss was makin baked chicken
[4:44:39] valianya: The real question is if the Riot MMO will build hurdles into the game specifically to force wasted time and incentivize microtransactions for quality of life.

[4:56:22] Epiclurker27893: The portals are great, gives people reason to do stuff other then rifts while leveling
[4:56:30] TheUnknowing: i mean i still play d4, not a lot but i play maybe a few hours a week still
[4:56:30] denflup: D4 bad?
[4:56:34] TheGiant99: almost redzone time
[4:56:36] DamnJester: its embarassing that players rather play the older version of the game
[4:56:44] nysctero: this guy so washed
[4:56:45] plddn: did u like d4 at all i only played it for a day the questine out powerd my toon and i gave up
[4:56:49] Vendralos: I uninstalled D4 yesterday when a boar offscreened me again
[4:56:54] bygodwest: Chargers

[4:57:02] TheGiant99: Chargers
[4:57:03] NickLeonhearth: they tried to make d4 a more mmo-ish exp, ppl didnt want that
[4:57:14] Vendralos: They charge you from offscreen and then one shot you
[4:57:16] sinlesssinner: yo
[4:57:19] Syprus1: @Aruar89 i didnt like it, but i think im just tired of arpg's. hyper repetive
[4:57:28] Affiiance: How are you feeling about Anthony Richardson now?
[4:57:32] Vendralos: Depends on what they do
[4:57:33] Gungre: Naw, I'm not going back to D4
[4:57:37] chEEsEypOOfs85: apparently they are making a ton of changes/additions for season 2
[4:57:46] chEEsEypOOfs85: but it is dead right now
[4:57:46] Gungre: The fact they're making yearly expansions AND  battle pass, fuck that
[4:57:54] Syprus1: i dont plan on going back to d4 either.
[4:57:55] Lulaboo: @bygodwest I want the chargers to win, but the way the Chargers can creatively fuck up goes in the Titans favor
[4:57:56] Nokterian: Its wait and see for S2 D4 so far the first season for D4 just didnt do it for me
[4:57:56] sinlesssinner: bro did u catch the leak of the classic expansion: Awakening? @Towelliee
[4:57:58] NickLeonhearth: i went back to D3 :D
[4:58:05] chEEsEypOOfs85: i havent even gotten past level 60 yet. been playing 3 diff characters totally casually
[4:58:07] emznev: im new to it and will go back for season 2
[4:58:09] 91Niki: @Gungre Suuuuuuuure you won't Kappa
[4:58:09] Grunton: d4 is a giant step down from poe and d3
[4:58:13] TheGiant99: there is no reason not to go back and try since you already spent the money. What point are you proving and to who by not playing it
[4:58:15] Tatuatul: there is mo hipe about the D3 new season then D4 :D
[4:58:18] Molvonos: This aint an airport.  You don't need to announce your departure from a video game.
[4:58:22] Niksen_99: A couple changes and new season and everyone will be back to D4 :D
[4:58:22] ro24tnt: frontier?
[4:58:23] Gungre: Naw, I wont; Niki
[4:58:27] Bixster: i went back to D3 as my side game. for me D4 need a couple more seasons of changes to be the better game.
[4:58:32] Gungre: I bought it on playstation, I'm not paying for PSplus to play that shit
[4:58:35] Syprus1: @Grunton agreed but i like d4 art direction

[4:59:02] 91Niki: Yep
[4:59:15] Molvonos: People're gonna come back to Season 2 D4, because it's something new.
[4:59:18] Grunton: it needs alot of end game for people to come back
[4:59:20] chEEsEypOOfs85: yea. retail was dead to me then dragonflight made it a lot better again
[4:59:20] 91Niki: Exactly
[4:59:21] TheGiant99: @Molvonos its funny to. I spent money on this game but I am not gonna play it just to a prove a point to myself LOL
[4:59:25] gozzy_mane: do u guys thnk its to late to start wotlk era? new to wow and got into retail did the heroic raid and want to experience old stuff. heard everyones geared though and its hard to get into groups
[4:59:31] Vendralos: They would need to stop with Mythic difficulty in WoW for me to want to play it
[4:59:32] TheGiant99: I cant wait for season 2
[4:59:42] pachadams: set gear would be something that ppl would like.. even if they hate the farm.. still something to look forward at end game
[4:59:54] denflup: what
[4:59:55] Syprus1: idk i never played season 1 of course i was only lvl 70 when i stopped before season 1
[4:59:58] Vendralos: Can you?
[5:00:03] emznev: wdf gta5 came out 10 years ago todaY ;o
[5:00:08] 91Niki: @Vendralos You do know you don't NEED to play that right? You can have fun without doing mythic ;)
[5:00:08] fillefaren: You can't get 450 ilevel KEKW
[5:00:10] Vendralos: in M+ you mean?
[5:00:15] Honvar: I just need archeology back in the game.
[5:00:15] MisterBongwater: Can't say I'll come back for S2, but I won't deny I got a little buzzed to play D3 S29 for I dunno what reason
[5:00:15] TheGiant99: Towelliee I played new world for 12 hours yesterday LOL
[5:00:17] Molvonos: @Vendralos There's so much to do in WoW but *mythic*, a mode you likely could never play, is why you don't play?  cmon.
[5:00:19] chEEsEypOOfs85: speaking of.. how is new world now? i havent played for a LONG time. heard they are adding mounts
[5:00:22] valianya: D4 needs to allow players who purchased a season track to complete it after the season ends
[5:00:24] Molvonos: Smoothbrain moments yes?
[5:00:25] Vendralos: @Vendralos and get worse gear yes, but that's not fun for me
[5:00:37] inj0shwetrust: Mythic is the only thing that keeps the game fun tbh  everything else just feels like a show up and get a trophy kinda deal
[5:00:48] NickLeonhearth: is new world having an expansion release soon or?
[5:00:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: then git gud and do mythic
[5:00:51] zealofsteel: i just tried to play retail and queued as a dps for a dungeon and didnt get a group after an hour of waiting, felt pretty bad :P
[5:00:55] TheGiant99: The hills some people are willing to die to prove a point in gaming is comical
[5:01:06] Nokterian: First season of D4 just didnt felt good to play i hate the whole maligenent stuff it was slowing down the game kill elite, click heart, wait for elite ResidentSleeper
[5:01:21] TheGiant99: no exler i think
[5:01:22] absahlute: hes OUT
[5:01:22] SlanginRock: no
[5:01:25] Vendralos: I've tried, but it's frustrating because people make mistakes for hours and progress is way too slow
[5:01:26] chEEsEypOOfs85: gus against cinci or breece against dallas?

[5:02:48] inj0shwetrust: You gotta find a better group to run with imo
[5:02:49] Peqdevil: need to put in the effort
[5:03:06] jerkchickenpapi: If you don’t like progressing I can only imagine how you face adversity in life lol
[5:03:24] Vendralos: @jerkchickenpapi Why do video games need to feel like real life? I thought we played those to get away from that shit?
[5:03:27] Stohlen: Half the fun is in the constant wiping on the bosses.
[5:03:35] TheGiant99: Life is about progression
[5:03:36] kimmo_gaming: there is 6 weeks of timewalking coming in a week, with hc loot, you can get 441 for sure lol

[5:04:28] denzilben1: When a game starts to feel like work it stops being fun. Then I know when to step back take a break and wait for something new
[5:04:41] TheGiant99: Todays mentality is - Hire me and pay me top dollar day one i deserve it LOL
[5:04:58] Vendralos: @TheGiant99 False equivalence
[5:05:00] Stohlen: @Sollice Or as one of my favorite Youtubers says "Everything is meaningless, and we're all going to die."

[5:10:53] Molvonos: @Broomba I stopped paying attention to sports when the Astros went on strike.  I grew up in Houston, lived on Westheimer.  Everything about Houston sports was stupid.
[5:10:59] Noshpan: Don't worry, I'm sure my Raiders will fuck it up in the 4th
[5:11:20] jerkchickenpapi: I’m originally from Houston and moved to Miami

[5:13:47] chEEsEypOOfs85: i listened to everyone saying he isnt gonna be good. as a die hard gators fan ive seen what he can do. if he gets his short/intermediate touch figured out, there is no stopping him. he has a killer deep ball and his legs can take him 75yds at any given time
[5:13:47] Syprus1: @TheGiant99 who wins betweeen dallas and jets?

[5:14:50] abracka_: @Molvonos it's pretty insane so far with the testing i've been doing. hitting upwards of 2.4mil hp in combat, the self healing is even more op now too

[5:37:04] chEEsEypOOfs85: i dont understand how their line is so bad.
[5:37:11] herzlustafir: never understod why the started at BC
[5:37:18] SonofHorus82: it's a QB right of passage to sign a huge contract and then immediately shit the bed for a few games.
[5:37:25] Tharia: @Stohlen no, sunken temple is different. that's the one in swamp. that was actually fun to me LUL
[5:37:42] Bulldawgx: Towelliee did you see the 2 hits last night from the Colorado State captain on the top 2 players on Colorado. It was an AWESOME victory for Colorado after that shit
[5:37:55] Tharia: hmm have to figure out now where mara is lol
[5:38:15] jonsnow518: they released lael collins, who was a beast for long time
[5:38:16] TheGiant99: The hit on Hunter the guy should of gotten kicked from the game for

[5:39:05] Noshpan: I can brag that I managed to get my (formerly BE) NB Hunter attuned to Molten Core before they removed the requirement.
[5:39:13] pachadams: that sound like Sunwell.. with a countdown to smash that scout dude
[5:39:26] Tharia: lol yes, it's fun but too confusing LUL
[5:39:36] Molvonos: Until you had to run it 6000 times to get a fucking NR trinket as a Warlock Tanking Princesss Huhuran

[5:39:43] pachadams: my best will always be Wailing cavern
[5:39:48] Bulldawgx: @thegiant99 I agree. When I rewatched the replay you can tell that he was sent out there to do that exactly to those players. He thought they had it won after the Hunter hit then when they realized oh shit Colorado came back he tried to take out the QB. Love what Deion did for his boy after that hit. Wipe the blood off and get back out there and finish it son
[5:39:56] dimofodi: i liked the early dungeons most, SFK/RFK/RFD and then ZF, love the 2H you can make if you get the 2 1handers in there

[5:41:10] Tharia: lol ZF was an experience for sure
[5:41:12] Kinghorn: ZF is the best because the whole place is 1 level, not a 10 level spread like every other dungeon
[5:41:41] Tharia: scarlet monastery was my favorite
[5:41:43] pachadams: and plus all the min max of knowledge also
