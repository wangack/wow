[0:39:33] justcrushingit: i use wowthing because my friend made it and i'm biased
[0:39:38] Galifaxs: So far my only grievance with zereth mortis, is how long it takes to unlock world quests and the like
[0:39:40] Sollice: Good morning friends
[0:39:43] captivate7: I started doing them yesterday after I saw you do them and I was able to complete my mage and hunter class mounts
[0:39:49] hanky_cpa: you tired bro?
[0:40:02] jerexify: @Towelliee The good thing is, you already did Paladin. That one sucked because you HAD to do the questline in Suramar to complete it.
[0:40:22] Frostfury: That's how I feel tired on reset day here Kappa
[0:41:15] lswallyl: that mount is huge!

[1:10:00] pacificmc1: It's only Revered, not that bad
[1:10:03] othraerir: takes a while to get revered rep anyway, i think you'd have flying before 2x lego anyway
[1:10:06] PraxicThorn: it's a day that ends in Y

[1:10:09] Drumac_: Drumac_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months!

[1:10:15] Allexi88: Revered isn't even that much of a grind lol
[1:10:28] jerexify: @Towelliee LMAO WoW players "happy"...
[1:10:35] fro_0: but its never been honored for big rep items kek
[1:10:36] smashwow: revered is fine. IF the rep grind isn't like that fucking archivist rep grind.
[1:10:38] reggiepowa: mass loss of subscribers incoming according to wow reddit because or revered reputation LUL
[1:10:57] propoopimus: just wow players, some never happy
[1:11:00] luckfore: mythic raiders are complaining they actually have to play the new content to get stuff
[1:11:07] Phaedrin: I think a lot of people just aren't happy playing MMO's anymore
[1:11:10] othraerir: sons of hodor says hi! :)
[1:11:11] DeanoTV: trueee
[1:11:14] KaisenSiru: Agreed
[1:11:19] Ertra: i heard it's a 23 day grind to get to revered
[1:11:19] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  appereantly ppl thought that they will get the 2nd leggo by just doing the campaign not the rep
[1:11:21] DeanoTV: people don't know what a mmo is anymore KEKW
[1:11:22] jaina8675309: revered reputation not that hard to get
[1:11:36] Drumac_: I can see a good portion are anti blizzard no mater what it is
[1:11:37] LourageTV: I think its more time gating and mobile game mentality more than the rep grinds itself that is triggering people
[1:11:38] cahoots82: I don't think revered is bad, it's the timegating that sucks.
[1:11:40] luckfore: its just a couple of people on twitter, better just ignore them
[1:11:43] thebluedoll: the problem is the story and quests suck , no one wants to admit that tho
[1:11:45] Sollice: "We want everything on day 1 of the patch GIVE IT TO US ALL" 2 weeks later....YOU SHITLORDS THERE IS NO CONTENT IN THIS PATCH
[1:11:53] Broomba: people injecting their own ideas and fantasies into the game
[1:11:55] PraxicThorn: @Sollice KEKW
[1:11:59] cahoots82: Timegating isn't even bad if they remove the "you can only get x rep per day"
[1:12:00] Lexxania: "how dare blizzard want us to slightly work toward unlocking something reeee"
[1:12:01] DeanoTV: people don't know what a mmo is anymore KEKW @Towelliee
[1:12:02] smashwow: @Towelliee nah it's that people heard no player power in the new zone. Devs weren't overtly specific to the point people understood.
[1:12:07] CardinalTX: reps just for rep is shite but grinding some rep for more power is always worth
[1:12:17] Julia: it all started with the "only endgame is the game", now its "only the reward is the game" danJulia
[1:12:22] Rexialiton: I'm sure that's because players don't understand what an MMO is lol. They want everything right now. That's not an MMO imo
[1:12:22] thebluedoll: do you need the belt or can you just get any 2 that you have?
[1:12:23] luckfore: Legion had timers too in the class hall and no1 complained then LUL
[1:12:31] Duekov: I don't think it's people don't wanna put time into the game, it's to get player power they want put time into the game into content that is challenging, not content that is mindless farming
[1:12:34] KaisenSiru: YEP like Isle of Thunder and Black Prince legendary cloak rep
[1:12:34] CardinalTX: rep grinds have always been there.....even before wow
[1:12:36] DeanoTV: people don't know what a mmo is anymore. KEKW @Towelliee
[1:12:36] adxx: lol remember raid attunements?
[1:12:36] LourageTV: not rep, time gating, fucking corporate shit
[1:12:43] smashwow: that mobile gaming on the pocpoc shit is awful. the lego is ok. we've got memories locked behind rep now. @Towelliee
[1:12:47] h00rayforstuff: because blizz bad wow bad updoots to the left
[1:12:47] cahoots82: @Towelliee It's not the rep, it's the timegating. I can't grind out the rep if I only have time to play twice a week because it's limited to X rep per day
[1:12:51] maalow: gachas are a mess of farming what are they even saying
[1:12:57] jerexify: @Towelliee That settles it, then. No more breaks for you!!!
[1:13:03] propoopimus: it's those damn millennials
[1:13:08] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee in so tired of the community hearing a buzzword from some youtuber and never shut the fuck up about it.
[1:13:09] griffdog125: Lol people forget alder/scyer rep grinds
[1:13:12] Broomba: people do not want wow to be like other games - mobile, time gates, etc
[1:13:13] geokouts: i dont like it and therefore everyone has to no like it...
[1:13:15] tuster12: its boring
[1:13:15] Acidwalk: The only complaint is the time gating for me rep grind and everything is good but when stuff is locked behind 24-48 time gates its a little annoying

[1:13:39] Marmoh: To be fair, reputation grinding was never particularly interesting
[1:13:39] smashwow: @cahoots82 that's not the time gating that people are really pissed about. it's that pocpoc talent tree that's awful.
[1:13:40] rensdeamo: Yh Boring grind
[1:13:49] tuster12: here for you not the game
[1:13:49] pacificmc1: Don't play if you find it boring then
[1:13:52] Alegnowar: revered is easy to get too, and once u have the memory it's account wide
[1:13:54] winstoncheckhill: the issue is it becomes a job not a game
[1:13:55] DeanoTV: move on then if u think its boring

[1:14:27] winstoncheckhill: @izabeL i pvp instead
[1:14:29] aptrist: pog jumping puzzles
[1:14:32] Duekov: The issue is the player power tied behind the grind. The grind should just give you cool shit like minions, mounts, xmogs. Player power should only be tied to the raid,dungeon, pvp content
[1:14:32] pacificmc1: @thebluedoll go play a puzzle game then
[1:14:33] Frostfury: I have no issues with Rep grinding like people just being lazy and complaining there is nothing to do
[1:14:33] zuru35: @DeanoTV Just because someone thinks its boring dosent mean they dont like MMOs, I play all MMOS and Shadowlands is the worse XPAC and boring AF

[1:14:43] thebluedoll: @pacificmc1 Don't shoot the messenger!
[1:14:44] smashwow: yeah i get rep isn't fun. but you grind it and you get rewards. get the rep, then wait for a research node. then wait for another and another. that's the mobile game piece.

[1:15:50] Flirtygrowl: Someone said in a YouTube comment recently that the issue is raiding, M+ and PvP have gotten so big they could be their own game on their own and people treat it like that. For some reason, people don't want to play WoW as a whole, only this "big 3".
[1:15:51] pacificmc1: TRUE LUL
[1:15:52] zuru35: Im pumped to grind the crap out of Lost Ark
[1:15:56] Throkkz: then they'll complain there's no content LUL
[1:15:57] mavericks312: yes ppl don't wanna work anymore cause new age gamers are lazy
[1:15:57] Drumac_: I think its the combination of collecting the resource you need to get a new item and then they add a timer to research the item. And to be honest thats more like how RTS games are anyway so whats the problem lol
[1:16:02] Mitchasoar: I'm excited to grind and have a new goal
[1:16:03] LourageTV: why we unlocking flying twice? its bullshit
[1:16:05] robot99: @zuru35 same!
[1:16:18] propoopimus: he's pvping
[1:16:25] luckfore: complete everything in a day and then complain theres nothing to do
[1:16:27] Alegnowar: twice? the first time was a renown thing u would have done anyway
[1:16:28] Duekov: Well lemme ask you this, is the revered 2 legendairies account bound or do you have to grind it out for every alt?
[1:16:40] DannyG757: morning
[1:16:43] zpandoreonz: We need less systems and more variety of content. Time gate was never an issue , actually it's been since vanilla
[1:16:47] mavericks312: @louragetv it's the first time unlocking flying
[1:16:49] thebluedoll: do you need the belt or can you use any two? @Towelliee
[1:16:50] Broomba: unlocking flying twice????
[1:16:55] Sollice: @Alegnowar Exactly lol. Grinding Renown. That was no grind
[1:16:55] nielefs: ppl are mad on blizzard whatever they do nowadays
[1:16:57] ArcaneSyntax: @duekov interview said account wide.
[1:17:17] jarilrpg: @Duekov it was said in an interview that it is account bound
[1:17:21] propoopimus: 20s
[1:17:21] hectabit: +20
[1:17:21] Duekov: Well that's much better than I originally though then if it's account bound
[1:17:21] qtceef: 20s
[1:17:22] jarilrpg: +20
[1:17:26] griffdog125: Lol people in here bitching but guess what.  You’ll still play lmao
[1:17:27] Hayon5: they should lower requirement for conduits , Mythic raid + glad is too hard lol  KSM is fine
[1:17:41] Alepouditsa: the sad part is the will hear thos mad ppl and the more the lesen to them the worse the game will become
[1:17:42] Aidler: @towelliee I‘m 90% with you. but you also said that some treasures or quests are too complicated to get in SL
[1:17:48] jarilrpg: @thebluedoll one covenant leggo and one other
[1:18:05] smashwow: i'm just surprised they haven't done a saddle system for the M+ rating like PvP
[1:18:33] PrimogenitureJ: lemme just smash box with a hammer
[1:18:46] reggiepowa: +20 is the easiest
[1:18:53] CardinalTX: puzzle are fine when playing Tombraider
[1:18:53] zpandoreonz: I would love we unlocking the flying with only a questline , long one but without the rep grinding today . I think flying needing a rep achiev or something is actually immersive breaking.
[1:19:09] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee im pretty sure the mythic raid part is only 1 boss.
[1:19:09] jaina8675309: here i am doing callings on 17 60s off
[1:19:12] Marmoh: You must have loved the Nazjetar world quests :p
[1:19:13] Hayon5: Yes you need 1 , but Mythic raid or Glad achievement is way too much , KSM is fine for the average player but Mythic-Glad ...
[1:19:18] jarilrpg: its *only* one +20 vs glad or mythic raid clear
[1:19:25] Sollice: Did Limit announce yet who they partnered with ?
[1:19:37] KinggKebab: @Hayon5 One +20 timed isn't asking too much at all. They shouldn't have to just give it to everyone
[1:19:50] ksbl: The guys complaining are mostly world first raiders. They don't get double orange before it starts
[1:19:53] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  yeah what was that about with Venruki lol?
[1:20:09] Hayon5: @KinggKebab but not everybody is into M+ , others options are Jailer mythic kill or Glad LUL
[1:20:09] ksbl: I see that as an concern
[1:20:19] Kindosar: its not KSM, its Hero, most people would think +20s are hard as well, but it'll definitely be the easiest to obtain for most
[1:20:35] KinggKebab: @Hayon5 So it should be okay to just be handed rewards? Rather than working towards anything... lmao
[1:20:43] Sollice: Did he not know what game he was playing?
[1:20:44] Broomba: the replies on the tweet thread was cringe
[1:20:45] Jarwerewolf: bs lol
[1:20:47] smashwow: that's a lot more than just, let's go get gear.
[1:20:49] ArcaneSyntax: that sounds made up
[1:20:56] luckfore: fake news
[1:20:56] PraxicThorn: that would be someone that doesn't know mmos and plays CoD LUL
[1:21:01] DerpingDumbo: so people dont like PVE at all
[1:21:04] Basic_BS: Yeah sounds like fan fiction
[1:21:10] jarilrpg: all that stuff is fine the first or second time, after that it gets ridiculous
[1:21:11] DerpingDumbo: some*
[1:21:18] thebluedoll: he probly did one torghaust then unsubbed
[1:21:20] PrimogenitureJ: Nah i've had that happen tryna get people into wow. But they also werent the biggest of gamers
[1:21:25] twistedstick1: what? I have to do stuff in a game. Must be a mobile game. towRee towRee towRee
[1:21:35] ArcaneSyntax: oh no i have goals whenever i play the game.
[1:21:39] Hayon5: @KinggKebab personnaly i don't care about having a 252 conduit or 278 , but for lot of people , they think it will increase their dmg by 15% when its 1% max LUL
[1:21:53] PrimogenitureJ: they also never made max lvl really now that i think about it
[1:21:58] Sabopotamus: there are definately ppl out there like that, ive played with several ppl that want everything handed to them
[1:22:00] KinggKebab: @Hayon5 Lmao, you right.
[1:22:02] Hayon5: @KinggKebab so Blizzard get lot of negativity for  0,5% upgrade dmg
[1:22:04] CardinalTX: people want instant gratification now more than ever. Everyone wants to not have to work very hard.  Everyone wants to be a youtube/tiktok/twitch star
[1:22:14] KinggKebab: @Hayon5 I concede, you actually right hahaha
[1:22:15] azzurrin: probably came from FFXIV where it's basically just get geat no systems involved but dungeon grinding a bit LOL
[1:22:17] Alepouditsa: he sounds one of thos that pay to win
[1:22:18] Roccocco: @Towelliee I heard the story on yt.. he got full geared pvp without leggo or condits or covenant. once he learned he need to do all he quited
[1:22:21] propoopimus: same, ive had a friend do the same.  if you have existing wow players complaining about new content a new player will do the same
[1:22:23] DerpingDumbo: there are a lot of people that dont want to have to do anything, they want to be able to just play.
[1:22:28] cipusanx: one thing i can say towellie is that back in mop I could level from 85 to 90 doing only pvp, do nothing but pvp and have the bis pvp gear. If you compare mop with shadowlands...well its a shit show
[1:22:42] Sollice: @Roccocco Then he wasnt fully geared....
[1:22:42] Alegnowar: way too repetitive too, once u unlock max conduits in a class u should have for all char
[1:22:48] DerpingDumbo: its one thing to get gear for pvp but needing everything else on top of it is what i understand
[1:22:54] aptrist: some people just want to instantly play the content they want. i dont agree with them but they exist
[1:22:56] MetalManGG: I call lies tbh
[1:22:58] Roccocco: fully honored gear*
[1:23:03] Broomba: that guy on that tweet thread called you casual -- lol KEKW  @towelliee
[1:23:03] tuster12: its not that we dont want to do ANYTHING, we want to do something new
[1:23:17] FiftykBolt: IMO that stuff was pretty fun to do the first time, the problem comes from having to do it again and again on every new character

[1:23:21] zpandoreonz: I dont just wanna feel at work playing wow, it's sad :(
[1:23:26] PrimogenitureJ: Most people dont really have solid logic backing up their actions though, so I wouldnt put it past someone LUL
[1:23:28] coldsarsparilla: youre on illidan now? thought you were on stormrage
[1:23:30] Duekov: In 9.2 can't you just do the new zone and craft the tier set?
[1:23:30] TheGaoSora: Whose tweet are we talking about?
[1:23:32] Hayon5: People think they can have fun 24h/24 in a MMO , you have to farms something annoying , it's not league of legend
[1:23:38] propoopimus: if you want to do wq and farm mounts you dont have to do shit, if you want to play challenging content you need to put in some work
[1:23:42] Sollice: He has been on Illidan for a couple of years on his main
[1:23:49] warrenny: @coldsarsparilla He faction an server transfered going into sl
[1:24:05] Sollice: @warrenny Nah was before that
[1:24:06] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee the flipside is that without any of this stuff there'd be nothing to do.
[1:24:09] tubbylicious: wish they would chanage the rep grind for people who only can play 3 days a week
[1:24:15] m3rk_zion: Morning Towelliee, hope you are well today
[1:24:29] Rottencoarse: @coldsarsparilla  he faction changed and transferred at the end of the BFA to play with his IRL friends
[1:24:43] Sollice: What MMO doesn't have some sort of a grind...
[1:24:48] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee grinding torghast is actually kinda fun for me now?
[1:24:50] CardinalTX: I dont mind grinding if it gets me something i want
[1:25:00] PrimogenitureJ: mannn was it really a couple years already? Its so weird how xpacs seem to be shorter in my head
[1:25:02] smashwow: grinding with a purpose and goal that is humanly achievable is great. meaningless grind. not great.
[1:25:04] Alepouditsa: i need grinding thing otherwise i get bord of the game
[1:25:09] Hayon5: They want to have fun 100% of the time , but it's a  fkin MMO , you have to unfun farm , always has been like this
[1:25:11] elbinn: i like grinding when it feels like i get a tangible reward in the end - concurrence of legionfall wasnt a fun grind
[1:25:26] drewetling: i grinded out all the olds stuff i didnt have
[1:25:29] thebluedoll: there's too many random things like conduits true
[1:25:38] Aidler: grinds offers a daily routine and sometimes I like it and sometimes I hate it
[1:25:44] Flirtygrowl: I don't know why, but people seem to think there's some kind of "objective" fun, some ideal version of it that has to be met.  Nope, fun is literally subjective.
[1:25:51] Douchecakes: The M+ is all 20s
[1:25:53] propoopimus: i grinded ap like a maniac during legion and bfa, i was ok with it, sometimes felt like work but it gave me something to do at times
[1:25:54] othraerir: not many people can get that
[1:25:56] Sollice: @Towelliee Calling it a grind is kind of misleading also. It's the games content
[1:25:58] Alepouditsa: heck i want more battler pets things to do to
[1:26:04] smashwow: no one liked the relic grind in legion. conduits is the same thing.
[1:26:20] Alegnowar: wait how conduits upgrades work in 9.2?
[1:26:26] fcsgamer: Good to be back here
[1:26:35] thebluedoll: torghaust is actually really hard if you dont have gear tho
[1:26:41] m3rk_zion: I gotta go through my UI and addons because something is kicking out a lot of errors and causing me to crash.

[1:26:45] mandarinetip: any idea when we will get news for the next expansion?
[1:26:49] Marmoh: I did enjoy the essence system in BFA actually
[1:26:54] CajunCrusader: Sorry if I missed it, what is your predicted date for 9.2 @Towelliee?
[1:27:10] smashwow: old lego acquiring is clunky. having to go back into CN for a lego that's still BiS feels weird. they need to fix that.
[1:27:18] rbayduden: more dmg pls
[1:27:23] rbayduden: :D
[1:27:43] Broomba: @towelliee -- if you hit renown 80 with all 4 covenants on 1 character is that account unlocked ?
[1:27:49] Hayon5: they are changing tierset every builds LUL
[1:27:57] twistedstick1: Like adding puzzles? towLets towGo
[1:27:59] ArcaneSyntax: they'll probably adjust the second leggo to be tied to the campaign.
[1:28:00] m3rk_zion: Wait Blizzard is ACTUALLY listening to players?!? mark it on the Calendar! it's a first!
[1:28:15] Sollice: Add puzzles to unlock tier set bonuses
[1:28:38] Sollice: Jump puzzles, tracing shape puzzles, matching card puzzles. ALL THE PUZZLES
[1:28:50] fcsgamer: Lost Ark

[1:29:02] M2thew: how u get it ?
[1:29:08] pavepawns: took me a week
[1:29:09] KaisenSiru: February the month spending time farming for love rocket again Sadge
[1:29:13] ArcaneSyntax: @towelliee i got that mount like week 2.
[1:29:16] othraerir: isn't it one boss a day?
[1:29:17] twistedstick1: Jump king, WoW edition.
[1:29:21] kuiper_ow: i got it on first kill and even dont know that he drops any mounts
[1:29:28] mandarinetip: any news for the next expansion?
[1:29:34] sgtalash: this year what is the minim level for the love rocket?
[1:30:05] Sollice: I have a better idea. Tie flying in to an upcoming WoW mobile phone. You cant get flying until you get to level 100 and have micro transactioned $100 in to the mobile game. That's what people want! Don't you all have phones!
[1:30:13] Heero_Effect: The next expansion will have humans in it
[1:30:41] bypized: big changes?
[1:30:44] twistedstick1: I am going to buy extra phones for that.
[1:31:52] sgtalash: i got the mount in the world quest
[1:31:56] chill_xf: man i feel like ive been farming onxiya for years how many attempts did it take u man?? thx for streaming use your streams as background news for farming@
[1:31:56] sgtalash: day
[1:32:06] Mecabeast: really helps when it's the world quest to kill 2
[1:32:15] othraerir: no kill 2 of those guys
[1:32:19] pilhass10: sometimes there's a world quest there to kill 2 boss's
[1:32:27] othraerir: nah
[1:32:27] jeffnsteff2019: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP nin6Bcc towHAMUP
[1:32:29] pilhass10: doesn't give you the mount
[1:32:37] a23pk: Morning brother! @Towelliee and chat!
[1:32:42] othraerir: but you need necrolord for sabriel mount
[1:32:44] pilhass10: no, it just makes it easier since there's people there killing it
[1:32:45] elbinn: no its just more people doing it so goes by faster
[1:32:57] jarilrpg: i thought the mount had to drop from the rare in the arena
[1:33:00] Kindosar: WQ means more people there = faster
[1:33:14] Mecabeast: we more people to do quest
[1:33:23] Mecabeast: wq*
[1:33:26] jarilrpg: i got the mount from the rare in the arena
[1:33:41] sgtalash: the legend is you creat a character and the firts kill is the mount

[1:33:53] Marmoh: Frostfire Ridge music is so good
[1:34:38] othraerir: i need to do that again (molten front) for some xmogs
[1:34:39] twistedstick1: Get a white board. put it by your desk and make a daily list.
[1:35:22] onybear: I have a note book by my computer to help me keep track….all the lists!
[1:35:39] Screamnsteam: @Towelliee i used your factor code yesterday and bought 12 meals
[1:35:55] Dinosew: It’s so hard getting shit done in wow when you have kids and then you’re tired and some days depressed lol
[1:36:03] jeffnsteff2019: they are about shutoff HOF ofor 9.1 raid very soon
[1:36:17] Sollice: Like your good your going to do it or like your good your not doin git

[1:41:56] drewetling: battle for old world
[1:42:03] Dalsonson: New World launched October
[1:42:10] Masqerader: july 20th - august 2nd for the battle for new world event
[1:42:19] Kindosar: @Broomba hitting 80 on all covenants means that your character can use all the xmog. i.e. you can't use ventyr xmog if you're night fae if you haven't hit 80 on venthyr.  But once you do, you can be night fae and use it -- 80 1 time unlock account free swapping.
[1:42:22] Aidler: „Battle for NW“ was a gaming highlight of 2021 for me
[1:42:31] DannyG757: necrolord mount rare

[1:42:48] bumpstock75: he's the one that drop the mount for nec
[1:42:54] pronkk_: its the one you bought for 5k anima
[1:42:54] Shidopie: No, a necrolord is needed to spawn it
[1:43:07] KaisenSiru: It's a Necrolord rare that spawns when someone triggers it with their anima conductor rank 3
[1:43:15] atowellthatiallreadyused: you should see what im seeing now on gehennas tbc towellliee the amount of ppl in shattrath and bt isnt even out yet makes me kinda happy to know tbc is so heatlhy on my server ;D

[1:43:19] KaisenSiru: Yeah same one for 5k
[1:44:00] Aravarth: What frame style of Gunnars are you wearing Towelliee? I just went to the opthamalogist to get an updated Rx and I need some new frames.
[1:44:19] Mecabeast: maybe a stream goal was hit?
[1:44:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: is this demon hunter the old topgun?
[1:44:43] Masqerader: Honestly, I think your reason was, with not as many people on alliance to get oondasta chances, you factioned to make it easier
[1:44:49] im_n0t_jezus: the hound dag i just random

[1:49:07] Aravarth: Once upon a time I was contemplating either LASIK or PRK
[1:49:32] Aravarth: I know recovery times on LASIK are super low, but the thought of someone carving a dead space into my cornea just gives me the heebie jeebies

[1:51:53] Sarocus: @Masqerader only it doesnt anymore
[1:52:03] gold9871: unity its called
[1:52:04] Masqerader: @Sarocus that is just for ptr testing
[1:52:08] raldrik: I think they should pull the ripcord and let you equip full lego
[1:52:10] Mecabeast: cove lego sounds like torghast power I've picked
[1:52:42] Sarocus: @Masqerader ah, ok

[1:53:49] PvtHudson093: thats what the cov leggo does for venthyr paladin
[1:53:56] Alienfromger: with music
[1:54:11] uhhhhyeayoo: Mythic plus, not wanting to pull pats. There’s times you may want to cancel it.
[1:54:20] hyrewatch: Morning folks
[1:54:28] m3rk_zion: I can see people fat fingering that on a macro lol
[1:54:28] raldrik: oooof im messing that up
[1:54:30] qtceef: reducig cd
[1:54:49] apopthis: @Julia that's....interesting.  Looks to be only on KR servers right now
[1:54:51] PvtHudson093: and it refunds when you use the leggo right?
[1:54:53] Dalsonson: But check the Runecarving ability for Ashen, that explains it all
[1:55:17] Mecabeast: what's the duration of ashen hollow 10-12s?
[1:55:29] Masqerader: spectral lupine should be a vulpera default ghostwolf
[1:55:46] luckfore: loot is now in dungeon journal
[1:55:54] Mecabeast: the ghoul dmg will be good in dungeons
[1:58:01] Masqerader: some of these sound quite fun
[1:58:37] plopptart: Destro 4pc is fun; purple infernal
[1:58:58] Mecabeast: destro is abilities used
[1:59:43] qtceef: +20
[1:59:44] Douchecakes: it's +20
[1:59:45] Lothawia: +20
[1:59:47] Rhelli0n: +20
[1:59:47] Rottencoarse: +20
[1:59:49] Allexi88: thats the +20
[1:59:51] othraerir: rip
[1:59:58] Poriand: they will lower it
[2:00:00] uhhhhyeayoo: +20
[2:00:04] Breakthecause: It only requires one of the KSM achievements
[2:00:05] KaisenSiru: Master is +15, Hero is +20
[2:00:06] h00rayforstuff: +20
[2:00:11] PvtHudson093: amen
[2:00:13] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  they will lower it tbh
[2:00:16] Screamnsteam: so make it easier for only the sweaty players LUL
[2:00:22] gdtomii: ill never get that Sadge
[2:00:26] qtceef: they have to lower all of the achivments u have to earn
[2:00:27] Allexi88: +20 isn't obtainable for a ton of players
[2:00:32] uhhhhyeayoo: 15 is waaaaayyyyy yooo ez compared to mythic end boss or glad
[2:00:32] othraerir: maybe they should have ranks of it, normal/heroic/mythic versions?
[2:00:45] h00rayforstuff: yeah I really don't know what value this is to someone who's timing 20s
[2:00:46] Masqerader: Blizzard "lets make all these great catch up mechanics in 9.1.5"    9.2 "Alright, let's fuck it up again boyz"
[2:00:51] neo_0098: they fuck us casual players yet again.
[2:01:08] elfwyn20: save us plz <3
[2:01:11] Bacanu34: or just make 262 m+15 / heroic raid
[2:01:21] CardinalTX: Gimme a rep grind option for all conduits  HahaBall
[2:01:22] tubbylicious: @neo_0098 true
[2:01:38] Poriand: just give it to players for exalted. why not lol
[2:01:42] h00rayforstuff: is it account tradable?
[2:01:50] qtceef: yes but 15s are way to easy to get an item like that tbh
[2:01:55] melogmr: Casuals dont need 278 conduits Kappa
[2:02:01] gdtomii: good to have exclusive stuff for the sweaty players, but this isnt unique, just a boost for the stuff other people have to grind endlessly
[2:02:05] OhNoNotAgain: @h00rayforstuff not atm
[2:02:09] Dalsonson: +15 isn’t the same as M Sepulcher or Glad though
[2:02:14] jerexify: @Towelliee Sorry, I was in a meeting. Is Keystone Hero the +10 achievement?
[2:02:19] Dalsonson: Even KSM isnt
[2:02:21] Moobot: towBleedpurple towGold Thanks for supporting The Hammer Squad by watching these 3 minutes of commercials! towGold You also have the option to subscribe to further plant yourself in our community and no longer see ads! towUp towBleedpurple
[2:02:22] gdtomii: @jerexify +20
[2:02:27] h00rayforstuff: @h00rayforstuff that's what I thought. Just not sure what the point is then?
[2:02:39] uhhhhyeayoo: You just have to do 1 +20 from the way it’s worded. Some +20s are pretty easy. KSM is wayyy too easy for something like this.
[2:02:40] jerexify: @gdtomii Oh, jeebus. Well, never getting that item then.
[2:02:42] pavepawns: i think +15 should give you an item that puts all conduits to 252 for alts. then +20 should give 272
[2:02:48] neo_0098: @jerexify you need to time every dungeon on +20
[2:02:57] h00rayforstuff: by the time you get those achieves, you're not getting much value from it tbh
[2:03:08] Allexi88: +20's aren't easy for alot of players though
[2:03:08] jerexify: Yeah, if it's +20s, then I'll never be getting that item.
[2:03:25] Anathdra: they probably add a +20 all achievement, otherwise the wording in the item doesnt make sense
[2:03:29] Frostfury: Just do NW 20 like it's free key
[2:03:38] uhhhhyeayoo: Yes so just 1 + 20 is reasonable
[2:03:42] gdtomii: does the keystone here require you to time it jokrdKEKW
[2:03:43] Bacanu34: or just pay 600k gold and get carry
[2:03:45] uhhhhyeayoo: Yes for hero has to be times
[2:03:52] qtceef: its free now, u dont know how they nerf the weapons in 9.2
[2:03:53] h00rayforstuff: yeah gotta be in time
[2:04:16] jerexify: It might be "free" for some, but not for all. There's a LOT of people in my "bad" boat. lol
[2:04:31] bumpstock75: +20 no thank you! i'm not gringing for item the will be useless in a year or so when 10 comes out.
[2:04:33] Screamnsteam: @Bacanu34 ksm is only 600k lol?
[2:05:00] Maego1: @bumpstock75 Then why even gear your character
[2:05:06] Bacanu34: @Screamnsteam for a 20+ not ksm
[2:05:06] Lothawia: @Screamnsteam 600k for a 20 i think he means
[2:05:09] gdtomii: @bumpstock75 so that means we should never get raid gear, since itll be useless eventually? jokrdKEKW
[2:05:32] im_n0t_jezus: niiiice
[2:05:42] Tjc222: Tjc222 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 112 months!

[2:06:10] PrimalRain: we hear you like splits LUL
[2:06:13] othraerir: yeah they defo need 4 chars each
[2:06:22] Eggz1004: @PrimalRain LUL
[2:06:23] kokochris: @Alepouditsa danKEK
[2:06:24] h00rayforstuff: @Screamnsteam not according to Morgan's interview with TSZ
[2:06:36] Screamnsteam: @h00rayforstuff thank god
[2:06:36] Alepouditsa: @kokochris danPanic
[2:06:43] Kindosar: raid isn't only place for tier this time
[2:06:49] kokochris: @Alepouditsa danHeh
[2:07:02] gdtomii: thats gonna spice up the RWF
[2:07:03] smashwow: @Towelliee that crafting will be weeks after the raid has launched. and they haven't said what that's locked behind to be able to craft
[2:07:06] qtceef: u can get tier sets from other content now :)
[2:07:08] h00rayforstuff: Yeah it's like a crafting mechanism where you can turn an item from the vault into a tier piece I believe.
[2:07:15] Jay_rb: Forcing world first players to pvp again PepeLaugh

[2:08:33] Maego1: Won't it only drop the currency required to craft tie tier item?
[2:08:37] h00rayforstuff: so will last 3 be the higher ilvl drops instead of the last 2?
[2:09:13] thefastestsnail: Another factor regarding the conduit item, shards will be disable week 1 so everyone is going to get a massive nerf. +20 is going to be even harder
[2:09:15] shuey23: that's Pog
[2:09:36] h00rayforstuff: the belt they give you is crit verse lol
[2:09:40] m3rk_zion: wait so in 9.2 I'll be able to have 2 Leggos as a Pally Tank O.o

[2:11:37] alucard3zz: i hope they make the lego bow to be upgradable
[2:11:50] wise_JESTER: What i dont have to craft multiple crap how 😊
[2:11:53] alucard3zz: by killing the last boss
[2:12:08] Masqerader: Famed Slayer lol... Azshara is Famed Slayer and she ain't dead
[2:12:11] BoiAtomico: Joeval Poggers
[2:12:14] pavepawns: i think what is gonna happen is we are gonna drain him of all his powers basically turning him fully off
[2:12:24] neo_0098: jovaal the zailor
[2:12:30] Masqerader: Jooval is Billie Joel's darkside
[2:12:38] KaisenSiru: @Masqerader She was killed. But N'zoth just revived her
[2:12:42] kimmo_gaming: So Baine slayed the Jailer? Kappa
[2:12:56] Masqerader: *Billy Joel
[2:13:06] Masqerader: @KaisenSiru she ain't dead and that's all that matters
[2:13:17] im_n0t_jezus: sepuko ?

[2:13:59] im_n0t_jezus: LUL
[2:14:01] orasay1996: i don't think azhara died though Clueless
[2:14:07] ChosenRonin: @im_n0t_jesus i hate numbers
[2:14:41] thunderkack: What if when we defeat the 'jailer' it actually turn out it was a decoy he created. would make sense the skeleton form of him
[2:14:56] Volkien: @orasay1996 She died, N'Zoth said 'not yet" and rez her/gave her cpr
[2:15:36] BoiAtomico: If you're brave enough, it could even be a dildo rooBlush
[2:15:37] orasay1996: Really always thought she was about to die since she is alive when lothramar and jaina walks up to her i dunno
[2:15:49] neo_0098: but at least he drops his weapon for us ;)
[2:15:53] rohdey: like the Reality stone scene
[2:16:12] viraal2784: this i just a simulation of the jailer to see if his plan works
[2:16:14] thunderkack: oh please God let it be. because they would be wasting a big villain to just kill him quick
[2:16:25] Duekov: This is Blizz we talking about, they aren't smart enough to do anything like that XD
[2:16:34] alejandrogonor: How many lvl 60 characters do you have?
[2:16:41] neo_0098: the jailers prototype doesn't make sense. He didn't look like this when he was crated he only got the whole in his chest when he was banished
[2:16:51] j_bar111: What are you trying to do?
[2:17:00] j_bar111: on the rogue
[2:17:10] maalow: class mount
[2:17:15] j_bar111: gotcha
[2:17:35] orasay1996: Did you mange to get any paragon legion mounts with the timewalking last year ?
[2:17:40] neo_0098: maybe zovaal at the end of the fight will go "You should ve gone for the head"
[2:17:42] ifirnja: can you loot the darkshore rares only once a week?
[2:17:43] CardinalTX: What if....we are fighting the Jailer.....hes pulls off his mask....and its Tom Cruise and the next expansion we are in the nest mission impossible!?
[2:17:45] neo_0098: xD
[2:17:46] flebbooo: good ol legion <3
[2:17:51] orasay1996: i manged to get the stormhiem drake PogU
[2:17:52] Mecabeast: wait they get 3 each dk only got one flying mount that changed colors based on spec
[2:18:25] FiftykBolt: How many mounts do you have atm?
[2:18:34] jerexify: @Mecabeast Yep. Locks get 4, Rogues get 4, Paladins get 4, Hunters get 3...
[2:18:59] Masqerader: class specific mounts if ur on a paladin, lock
[2:19:00] jerexify: @Towelliee Check to see if you still have Fallen Charger, since you don't have the achievement...
[2:19:03] Masqerader: will give it a +1
[2:19:08] Kindosar: paladins have base class mounts, so they have more
[2:19:20] rensdeamo: Blizz cant count
[2:19:20] Dalsonson: It’s the Paladin Horsey, same as the DK Horsey
[2:19:29] Mecabeast: @jerexify damn only did the dk story I got jipped lol
[2:19:32] neo_0098: I don't know why but I have hope for 10.0 ....
[2:19:37] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: I know its' been a while, but what trinkets did you use for the bear mage tower? @Towelliee
[2:19:42] jerexify: @Mecabeast lol
[2:19:49] orasay1996: Expansion announcment modCheck
[2:19:57] neo_0098: but I doubt they are already working on the next expansion
[2:19:57] UNSUNG_HER0: everyone
[2:19:57] Sadlock__: me :)
[2:19:59] shimwood: Xavius did nothing wrong!
[2:20:01] jerexify: @Towelliee In-game, no. His lore story, though, in the War of the Ancients trilogy? Freaking amazing.
[2:20:01] rensdeamo: Same problem wtih the 400 mount achieve - Blizz cant count
[2:20:03] TSquadSully: xavius is a biatch
[2:20:14] neo_0098: @orasay1996?
[2:20:30] CajunCrusader: I liked him in the War of the Ancients books, but no so much in WoW.
[2:20:35] fletch8: me
[2:20:35] orasay1996: @neo_0098 just wondering when they are gonna announce the next xpac or were
[2:20:44] Alegnowar: they should add a 600 one
[2:20:49] Masqerader: @HD_MOVIE_SOURCE unblinking gaze from Iskar in Hellfire Citadel
[2:20:56] FiftykBolt: How would you go about starting mount farming? Im at about 230 right now and would love to get some of the higher achievemnts
[2:21:08] Rottencoarse: towOny towOny
[2:21:18] HD_MOVIE_SOURCE: @Masqerader thanks
[2:21:25] Maego1: Bit off topic but gotta say, im in love with boba fett theme song :D so good
[2:21:28] neo_0098: @orasay1996 probably not until 2023

[2:21:49] BoiAtomico: did ony outgrew your streaming room Towelliee?
[2:22:13] shuey23: also btw if you dont have race mounts you can buy them on a trial character to skip rep requirements
[2:22:25] gold9871: lazer rocks

[2:30:29] orasay1996: Gul'dan PepeHands
[2:30:29] jerexify: @ChimmyNeutron lol My personal opinion. I LOATHED Suramar.
[2:30:42] Masqerader: if we're having dragon isle and its a void/lord old god story, I can assume will see her ass there
[2:30:50] kiakovic: Why are you doing Legion stuff?
[2:31:01] all_beef_franks: I know we just fought him but what do you think about Wrathian?
[2:31:02] Colt_Engineer: an illusion...what're you hiding?
[2:31:10] jerexify: @kiakovic Working on class hall campaign for mounts.
[2:31:15] lalelusa: Something was not quite right with Suramar^^
[2:31:20] UNSUNG_HER0: Suramar was legit fun no Kappa...disagree youre a dreg
[2:31:21] Pippinn: i just don't remember it being that bad honestly
[2:31:31] PrimalRain: it wasn't terrible tbh
[2:31:52] Masqerader: I enjoyed suramar
[2:32:02] Masqerader: lol ya
[2:32:08] orasay1996: I loved that WQ with the arcwine making LULW
[2:32:14] Cafe0le: i member KEKW
[2:32:17] Bahamut145: To do the withered training :)
[2:32:17] bigbearjackson: that quest is what broke me
[2:32:31] jeffnsteff2019: what if jailer is just a decoy to a bigger picture
[2:32:46] m3rk_zion: Yeah I leveled through Legion lol longest and most gruling I've done in awhile
[2:33:15] Toffekotten: assuming you got flying there :(
[2:33:17] jerexify: I like leveling in Draenor or Wrath. Either one.
[2:33:17] Mecabeast: I like that the neck drop from the jailer looks to be a parallel item to the heart of azeroth
[2:33:19] pacificmc1: I am leveling in Jade Forest rn, pretty awesome zone ngl
[2:33:23] kiakovic: I like levelling in Pandaria and doing the farm.
[2:33:27] HotHotHeals: dungeon leveling is a vibe
[2:33:31] gretzwaah: Jade forest is the shit imo
[2:33:35] 210Crawler: What level should we start at WoD
[2:33:41] Masqerader: or enter a 16 digit cheat code and bam 60
[2:33:50] m3rk_zion: I usually do Pandaland, just wanted to try something different lol, was a mistake lol
[2:33:55] jerexify: @Towelliee No. You'r flying.
[2:33:57] jerexify: Drop down.
[2:34:02] KhalaVenix: take the mop seaturtle
[2:34:08] SaDos: i leveled through pandaria dungeons
[2:34:10] SaDos: so short
[2:34:15] chrslp: chrslp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Think you'll go back to TBC classic at any point? BT or Sunwell?
[2:34:28] fletch8: i love lvling in WOD
[2:34:32] Mecabeast: me not that kinda orc
[2:34:36] Frostfury: MORE WORK?
[2:34:47] kiakovic: I once leveled a character with archeology (in pandaria)
[2:34:52] chrslp: TBC classic really died so suddenly it seems
[2:35:30] sonofargus: yo KPOPmerch
[2:36:00] OathXP: Season of mastery would have been great if there were specific seasonal rewards (mogs, mounts, pets, anything really)
[2:36:26] orasay1996: The only good thing about tbc is the arena system and tbh that thing will be alot better in wotlk
[2:36:36] PloxxTV: I am so hyped for wotlk
[2:36:53] UNSUNG_HER0: literally every wow xpac ever "fresh"
[2:36:54] jerexify: They do, yes.
[2:36:59] Aravarth: I mean, I think that's why the SOM is the thing. A 12-month cycle is quick enough to keep that audience engaged.
[2:37:14] Kelticlore: I think the classic servers are a good way to show how the game could of been if the cut content was added
[2:37:34] Aravarth: Exaaaactly.
[2:37:51] Aquadriel: NONE KEKW
[2:38:11] Aravarth: Bosses have slightly different hardmode mechanics, and the Souls of Iron, but that's about it.
[2:38:12] Broomba: wtf?
[2:38:33] jeffnsteff2019: wow needs a season pass with rewards
[2:38:34] PloxxTV: back in the day we were all terrible.
[2:38:42] pacificmc1: @moonshadows83 LMAO no
[2:38:49] m3rk_zion: I personally think Blizzard can learn a lot from quite a few private servers.

[2:39:06] Heero_Effect: @selenafkngomez nope I was a pro gamer
[2:39:23] Kelticlore: I was hearing that they had plans to have dks as the core part of game and hellfire peninsula was planned as part of classic I heard
[2:39:24] jeffnsteff2019: no i am talking about what SWTOR has
[2:39:26] chrslp: Did they add dailies in TBC classic yet?
[2:39:27] NeverStopRaging1: playing AOE4 instead
[2:39:39] jerexify: Not long at all.
[2:39:42] Kelticlore: but they got cut
[2:39:45] Aquadriel: @Towelliee they will learn from the D2R team, they are adding new shit balancing some classes and changing how some mechanics work, all without messing up the core of the game.
[2:40:06] Jinx1348: @moonshadows83 what daily login rewards?
[2:40:29] jeffnsteff2019: no

[2:41:06] Masqerader: When You LFR spam TOS for mount and something pops up on your screen and its a legendary instead /cry
[2:41:09] pacificmc1: whats gonna be lit about it :)
[2:41:16] Jinx1348: @moonshadows83 oh yeah you  are right
[2:41:19] PloxxTV: I cant wait to spam path of frost in cap cities
[2:41:24] Kelticlore: do you feel wrath classic will be the final classic to be released
[2:41:25] RagingPunk: he knows towPog
[2:41:32] j_bar111: I wonder if they will require a lvl 55 to make DKs for classic wrath
[2:41:33] Aquadriel: Then again, the first classic wow was barebones cause thats what the 'purists' wanted. Which then everyone else realized "yeaah this kinda sucks"... so you think you do....
[2:41:36] Hayon5: what is your best top 3
[2:41:37] notdustinx: Fuck illidan i guess?
[2:41:40] pacificmc1: need MOP classic
[2:41:43] Heero_Effect: Can’t wait for BFA classic :)
[2:41:44] Acidwalk: Are there 2 more phases in tbc?
[2:41:53] CardinalTX: Look at everquest.  That game survives by re-releasing progression servers with different rule sets. Of course their servers you can use their version of a token
[2:41:55] jasperboy: Sooo what you're saying. Wrath raiding and content in general is actually gonna be hard?
[2:41:58] jeffnsteff2019: like last sseason in SWTOR u got companion mount appearance lvl 50 boost to companion and more through vendor
[2:41:58] Mecabeast: can't wait to see drama about lego mace and axe
[2:42:01] Masqerader: MOP/Legion Classic only 2 I will ever play
[2:42:02] orasay1996: @pacificmc1 was watching reckful re runs today of him playing mop arenas Sadge
[2:42:09] pacificmc1: @orasay1996 good times
[2:42:12] ImRayFinkle: cant wait for 10 million OP DKs again
[2:42:24] Breakthecause: @Towelliee you think Wrath Classic is this year?
[2:42:28] CDT_tv: ultimate 6.1
[2:42:37] CDT_tv: april most likely
[2:42:39] PrimogenitureJ: thats...a lot including retail lol
[2:42:45] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  also Lost Ark hype for NA and EU
[2:42:53] Graviits: @Towelliee do you think we will get an new expansion this year?
[2:42:56] chrslp: Anyone else looking forward to Hogwarts Legacy game?
[2:43:03] Aquadriel: denied KEKW
[2:43:04] j_bar111: I wonder if they will require a lvl 55 to make DKs for classic wrath
[2:43:05] unholyhoit: ...one year into 9.2 later...KEKW
[2:43:06] CallMeWallie: New Warcraft expansion announcement?
[2:43:12] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  D E N I E D
[2:43:21] ninedraft317: im thinking nov for wrath
[2:43:23] Shallzlive: not playing new world anymore @towelliee ??
[2:43:23] CallMeWallie: Do you guys think Activision is going to dissolve blizzard or rebrand them?
[2:43:24] Aravarth: I don't think they would release Wrath Classic until at least Sunwell has come out. But then again, they may rush it if they notice the population on TBC is falling off sharply, and they want to get them back.
[2:43:27] Pippinn: 58 is what they required
[2:43:34] Aquadriel: @Towelliee doing these assaults also gives good Rep with the zone... for Paragons
[2:43:42] PloxxTV: path of frost spam in cap cities
[2:43:46] jeffnsteff2019: and u get get season token every so often buy season rewards
[2:43:50] xideontv: i really hope a wow 2.0 annoucement i wouldn't mind a 24 months 9.2
[2:43:50] Aravarth: Yeah, Ulduar was fucking hard when it was live.
[2:44:26] PloxxTV: sunwell is a time gated unlock
[2:44:27] chrslp: I enjoyed the Sunwell patch. Lots of dailies and rep items
[2:44:27] Mecabeast: 4-6mos I think
[2:44:31] Lifestream7: they still on p2 sunwell is last phase
[2:44:31] heirosss: aq was august 2020 tbc lanuch june 2021
[2:44:32] jerexify: Ulduar was so much fun, though. I didn't make it all the way through at the time it was live, because I barely raided, but man it was a blast.
[2:44:41] SamDavidsin: sunwell is a like 8-10 months yet
[2:44:47] Dalsonson: Naxx was released in Dec, TBC wasn’t released until June/July
[2:44:50] Monkkey: Hey I really enjoyed your SL how it started vs how its going video. Would love to see more content like that. Is there a reason why you dont make more videos like that?
[2:44:54] Acidwalk: phase 3 is next month most likely then there are two more phases
[2:44:54] xideontv: is hardmode molten core over?
[2:44:58] ImRayFinkle: I remember when you were a boss if you had downed Elagon
[2:45:09] PloxxTV: how long does it take for sunwell to fully unlock from release? isnt it like 3 weeks?
[2:45:09] Dalsonson: And we haven’t even got BT/Hyjal yet, let alone the other 10 man
[2:45:16] ninedraft317: after classic wrath they should roll a new expansion every year
[2:46:41] sharpzyog: both of those guilds are done
[2:46:47] ninedraft317: classic that is
[2:46:51] jasperboy: They should do Wrath, skip Cata and go straight into MOP. Kappa
[2:46:54] Broomba: wtf?
[2:46:54] Kelticlore: I thought I heard that's apes dispanded
[2:47:06] PloxxTV: @jasperboy I would love them so much if they did this
[2:47:28] Poriand: i still watch alot of the apes streamers
[2:47:34] pavepawns: or we just stop making classic

[2:47:44] pacificmc1: then they can stop after that :D
[2:47:54] pacificmc1: CATA WAS NOT THAT BAD
[2:47:55] Rottencoarse: yeah i aint playing cata classic
[2:48:00] Rottencoarse: mop classic maybe
[2:48:04] Acidwalk: they should just stop after wrath
[2:48:04] sklingel: cata had fun pvp
[2:48:05] ImRayFinkle: MOP Classic would be sweet
[2:48:09] Havenmess: I loved Cata...feelsbadman
[2:48:11] Brandiops: cata was one of the better expansions
[2:48:11] jasperboy: @SELENAfknGOMEZ I would probably intentionally break my legs or something, get months of from work and nerd out MOP like the good old days
[2:48:17] kaldoroth: would love WoD Classic
[2:48:18] Jinx1348: @pacificmc1 it was not that good either:)
[2:48:18] Brandiops: compare it to what we get today
[2:48:25] pacificmc1: @jinx1348 better than all recent stuff tho KEKW
[2:48:30] CallMeWallie: Honestly, I would love a wow reboot,
[2:48:39] ImRayFinkle: What we really need right now is a BFA Classic Kappa
[2:48:41] Throkkz: "exalted?? omg what a mobile game"
[2:48:43] CallMeWallie: As much as I love the game, cooould use a touch up
[2:48:43] OnyxLair77: Are the servers lagging for anyone else?
[2:48:46] Poriand: Stalker 2 just got delayed for 6 months
[2:48:49] nightmayor12: Shadowlands classic modcheck
[2:49:03] Kavieonn: wow cheater!
[2:49:10] Kavieonn: using mount to cheat
[2:49:12] Jinx1348: @pacificmc1 so is a trip to the toilet :D
[2:49:22] pacificmc1: KEKW true
[2:49:28] CallMeWallie: I rather not have to download Deadly boss mods abs seven other tank add ons if I can help it, just let me play the game as is :c
[2:49:35] 210Crawler: Thats dope!
[2:49:44] Towelliee: !@npc
[2:49:44] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  why a panda npc for u tho XD
[2:49:48] Towelliee: !npc
[2:50:12] mongsns: pandas name was changed. Name is now ding'le
[2:50:52] othraerir: most people wouldn't know them
[2:50:58] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  Tauren would be better imo instead of a panda
[2:51:00] 210Crawler: that makes sense
[2:51:13] Kavieonn: Friendos i need a new reliable SUV for out of town trips for work, anything you guys recommend getting
[2:51:23] pacificmc1: should've been a pala KEKW
[2:51:28] jxxpn: Cool
[2:51:30] CardinalTX: Does he vape?
[2:51:31] m3rk_zion: I didn't know you had an NPC
[2:51:32] WolfMan4500: robin williams is in the game also
[2:51:33] UNSUNG_HER0: that was back when Blizz was being generous and giving everyone NPCs
[2:51:38] CallMeWallie: You’re a legend Taulli
[2:51:39] ImRayFinkle: Shouldve made him a rye whiskey maker Kappa
[2:51:44] bigdaddystunna: @Kavieonn subaru crosstrek
[2:51:50] SGammer2142: Cool I thought they were gonna stop doing that
[2:51:56] Alienfromger: how long yo you meditate a day? Kappa
[2:51:58] mekazen: still sad they removed swifty's :(
[2:52:22] Rottencoarse: i forgot why did they removed his npc?
[2:52:27] Chef_Gusteau1: What’s the point of honoring you in game if they can’t get YOU in the game, being a monk doesn’t make sense
[2:52:30] Perseus_IRL: why did they remove swifty?
[2:52:34] sklingel: corruption gear was lame at the time but now I miss it
[2:52:35] CallMeWallie: Lmao ,” Here’s a hero of Azeroth,  Jaun Sanchez Gonzales Vasquez,” feels a little out of place,
[2:52:42] mekazen: they was a controversy someon e tried to me too him
[2:52:45] mekazen: if i remember
[2:53:20] gravlaxxx: panda has one that use to be called chenglish but they renamed it to his be like his last name ding lee
[2:53:22] pacificmc1: sodapoppin
[2:53:38] flebbooo: Except Switys got removed
[2:53:48] Crypticedge: @towelliee what do you think of the rep needed for Lego belt?

[2:54:03] Aidler: Swifty sadly was removed
[2:54:07] CallMeWallie: I think it’s 😎 cool@
[2:54:17] raphelio: hopefully they dont skip patches like in the past years....
[2:54:24] Kelticlore: you doing this to get class mount
[2:54:28] Aquadriel: they removed the rep requirement
[2:54:33] WolfMan4500: swifty was removed because of sexual harassment though right?
[2:54:35] Kavieonn: When does the next Wow Expansion release?
[2:54:39] Breakthecause: @Aquadriel Only for the PRT
[2:54:42] Breakthecause: PTR
[2:54:45] TSquadSully: @aquadriel for testing only
[2:54:49] Aquadriel: oh ok
[2:55:21] Aidler: @zippaya no but he obviously would be a bald mountain climbing pandaren monk
[2:55:27] Firedexx: Firedexx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 105 months! 
[2:55:34] Crypticedge: Guy on twitter said, last ptr build took him 21-24 days to get revered. He hasn’t tested this build though
[2:55:35] brucezhu: You need to do the whole broken isle achievements line iirc
[2:55:36] Ekimro: So many people complaining about having any sort of grind attached to flying or player power. But like… what do you want? Just have everything handed to you for free so you can log off instantly as soon as the patch drops.
[2:55:38] Kelticlore: @kavieonn if they keep to the same timeline roughly should be around November
[2:55:46] jarilrpg: @chie_gaming they said "no player power in the cypher system" everyone is misremembering
[2:56:01] Kavieonn: @Kelticlore New wow expansion this year then? Kreygasm
[2:56:14] pavepawns: tbh this one is all on us
[2:56:21] Archiee: @Towelliee go talk to Khadgar in the spire, unlock world quests. Then go see Khadgar at Krasus Landing and unlock the island where the tomb is. Get the quest from the island for the champion and complete that and it will unlock your quest for the mount.
[2:56:28] ph0enixuk: @towelliee what legendary would you suggest for a prot pala with no other legendaries?
[2:56:38] Archiee: You don't have to do all these shenanigans
[2:56:40] pavepawns: i do remember gating but i didnt remember the rep part
[2:56:42] M2thew: i don`t mind, i play the game no matter what
[2:56:50] pavepawns: i thought it was campaign gated
[2:57:02] mavericks312: problem is wow players have selective hearing
[2:57:09] Archiee: I just did my mage yesterday
[2:57:14] Archiee: the one in Dalaran
[2:57:24] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  the main building in Dala
[2:57:27] Kavieonn: Zygor doesnt show how to unlock the mount?
[2:57:29] TSquadSully: the main building in dalaran
[2:57:39] Kelticlore: @kavieonn normally it's around every 2 years
[2:57:40] Crypticedge: 24 days to get revered on last PTR build.
[2:57:45] DannyG757: LUL
[2:57:50] kingliar: man legion was soo good
[2:57:54] Archiee: As long as one character on your account has done everything you can skip all this on alts
[2:57:56] PattiFord: When Cypher Equipment Level (increased by Cypher Research) increases iLevel of gear, is that affecting "player power"?
[2:57:57] TSquadSully: good question KEKW
[2:58:06] Kavieonn: The expansion where we got player housing was the best
[2:58:08] WolfMan4500: @Ekimro i would rather grind like TBC and classic imo.  the Slands grinds are crazy too me.  go grind renown, then go grind cov stuff, then grind soulbinds and conduits.  then grind the maw and that rep.  and all those systems are linked and gated behind each other.
[2:58:15] Aidler: everybody has selective hearing…. maybe a 100 year old zen monk hasn’t
[2:58:20] jerexify: They removed the rquirement of completing the class campaign for the mount...? Well, I'm upset. I did all fricking 12.
[2:58:24] Archiee: I did the same stuff yesterday until I read wowhead lol
[2:58:31] Jomuse92: Hey it was 2 hours of a TED talk and content worth
[2:58:41] luckfore: but according to wowhead you have to complete the class hall campaign
[2:58:55] Gingerprimer: Yeah you only havev to campaign do campaing + recrutie your broken shore follower and then you are done
[2:59:10] Crypticedge: Looks like you won’t get the belt until Mythic release then?
[2:59:21] Archiee: Ohhhhhh.... Didn't know these were class hall quests. My bad. Just got here lol
[2:59:23] kingliar: well tbh revered isnt that much. it has been revered for flying etc past expansions and it was pretty fast
[2:59:43] Rottencoarse: @Archiee  yeah he is doing class hall quests for the class hall mounts
[2:59:43] jarilrpg: the belt is from a quest chain, you wont be able to wear a second leggo till after mythic release most likely
[2:59:46] dranet11: The 278 all conduit item looks really nice too
[3:00:09] Archiee: @Rottencoarse Yeah I knew it was for the mount just didn't know he hadn't done the class hall bs yet
[3:00:18] dranet11: 10/10m, gladiator or all 20+ keys
[3:00:22] WolfMan4500: see i dont mind grinding reps.  as long as its more like tbc wrath era grind.  let me go grind out mobs for rep tokens ya know.   or even dungeon grind for reps like in tbc.  even if its small amounts.
[3:00:27] Kelticlore: eggs with real garlic and beer sounds interesting
[3:00:30] kingliar: i guess they wanna  be certain leggo combos are not broken, so thats why they are  trying to delay it a bit
[3:00:32] Dramatixxxx: yeas
[3:00:35] gold9871: yes twice
[3:00:35] Archiee: Yeah :(
[3:00:35] jerexify: Yes.
[3:00:37] Dramatixxxx: yes
[3:00:40] Crypticedge: Yeah it def needs to be lowered,
[3:00:45] iamWaritself: correct good sir
[3:00:49] Dalsonson: Just to make sure I’m remembering this correctly: The way we wear 2 legendaries is a belt that dynamically changes what legendary power it is based on what covenant we belong to? @towelliee
[3:00:54] gold9871: 2 * 5 missions
[3:00:55] Broomba: welp xqc watching Gordon Ramsy cooking videos
[3:00:59] Archiee: But you can skip the shenanigans of everything else
[3:01:01] wezhetique: yes
[3:01:08] pronkk_: good thing i have all 8 timed 20s
[3:01:10] dranet11: i guess they are adding an achiev

My girlfriend was part of it as well, we got married in game and all that jazz. She passed away irl, so there's that extra baggage on the game as well
[3:23:49] bioreducto: i really loved the gold making in legion

[3:26:42] Draknios: NoPixel has a whitelist and its very hard for new people to get into easily unless you know the right people. Otherwise you have to wait in the queues for awhile.
[3:26:42] CordovaGC: some servers require money for GTA RP
[3:26:47] Alrielda: sounds cool
[3:27:00] chrslp: @Havenmess Yeah but the "streamer server" is NoPixel

[5:43:24] Kinghorn: ohhhh
[5:43:27] Kinghorn: LUL
[5:43:33] wezhetique: don't you alreadt gor the fallen charger?
[5:43:47] Kinghorn: yeah you dont need the mount just a kill
[5:43:48] Mecabeast: I think there's a meta achievement for legion to get all the class mounts
[5:43:48] senseofpurpose90: have you any tip if blizzard plans to make account wide everything?
[5:43:54] tomcruise210: i am missing so many unobtainable mounts Sadge
[5:44:03] senseofpurpose90: i do xD

[5:44:28] Orrkkyy: crusher is usually up it will do the zone wide announcement
[5:44:28] jimmix12: i can look on eu but thats not gonna help you XD
[5:44:40] tomcruise210: i never used to like the idea of tauren pally but they look badass in that armor
[5:45:09] J_Rich94: did that just say Mor'Goth?
[5:45:13] jerexify: @Towelliee What's your least favorite of the 4 assaults? Mine is Maldraxxus.
[5:45:14] J_Rich94: or am i crazy
[5:45:16] Calphurnious: @tomcruise210 Man, the last reset during TBC before Wrath came out I was 1 second off the timer for the Amani War Bear
[5:45:32] Angrydoodle: heroes is up

[5:45:43] tomcruise210: @tomcruise210 damn id actually cry lol
[5:45:54] Angrydoodle: you ride a tree and there are named mobs you go save
[5:45:54] gold9871: nope 6 assaults
[5:45:55] stat15t1c: when the quest is up, you ride a Tirannen around and help npcs.  Just find the named ones--can be done at once
[5:46:05] stat15t1c: can look at wowhead for the location
[5:46:07] Wcvechten: You can save all of them in one quest
[5:46:28] MajesticAsFukk: @Towelliee it can be done all at the same time
[5:46:37] senseofpurpose90: is there plans for streamlining quests? so we can actually finish the story by expansions and not have all patches available and mixed at the same time. i'm fighting queen azhara, nzoth and 8.1 at the same time. and its valid for all expansions, ofc besides shadowlands.   i realize its for catch up, but it should be clear that you are skipping content, you shoulnd be obliged to go to wowhead and study te quests lines...  imo
[5:46:59] senseofpurpose90: you know why people like to farm mounts? because they are account wide
[5:47:10] corpsmanup1989: somehow im over 200 kills for this mount and still dont have it
[5:47:17] senseofpurpose90: yes please
[5:47:21] senseofpurpose90: that would be awesome
[5:47:33] senseofpurpose90: but they could warm people
[5:47:52] Niksen_99: Do you like shadowlands Tauren model or classic tauren model more? @Towelliee
[5:47:54] senseofpurpose90: fair point
[5:48:03] senseofpurpose90: but if there was a warning
[5:48:07] senseofpurpose90: oh ok
[5:48:10] senseofpurpose90: sad
[5:48:11] Vivelli: just chromie time it 4Head
[5:48:12] Brandiops: it is a good idea
[5:48:13] Autoexeq: They could have a Chromie in every zone
[5:48:14] corpsmanup1989: corpsmanup1989 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:48:25] Mecabeast: if the game was built around an msq thing it'd work
[5:48:43] senseofpurpose90: i can only wish then  xD
[5:48:48] BoiAtomico: basiclly asking for the game to work like FF XIV MSQ shit
[5:48:50] BoiAtomico: LUL

[5:49:34] corpsmanup1989: yeah my guildy came in when i was killing it and got the mount first try
[5:49:35] TheRealAxiom: i did it tho during the WQ
[5:49:37] Rossavitz: can any of them drop the mount?
[5:49:41] HaxzorJimDuggan: pretty sure i got this mount when I was just trying to cap my anima for the week
[5:49:42] corpsmanup1989: and im sitting here at 200 attempts lol
[5:49:49] Birder_L: i think i got it from the dragon
[5:50:17] BoiAtomico: there's 2 mounts on there @Towelliee one is a random drop from any of the mobs, the other is a specific drop from a anima channeled necro thingy that only drops on that rare
[5:50:23] corpsmanup1989: i think my addon was counting every kill even if i killed them that day though so im probably closer to 100 kills
[5:50:31] cabalish: droprate is up to 0,7%
[5:50:47] at1c: you sure thats the same mount?
[5:50:52] BoiAtomico: the other one is random from any of the bosses present, just gotta kill until it drops
[5:50:56] Bayne77: automatic
[5:50:59] Trignus: lol

[5:51:27] drewetling: the new sha lol
[5:51:34] nempco: do you have the sha of anger mount ?
[5:51:40] Calphurnious: @Alegnowar krippKEK
[5:51:58] Angrydoodle: how many kills was sha
[5:51:59] Mecabeast: venom and carnage gfuel collector boxes back in stock it seems
[5:52:16] Alrielda: 0.7 and i got it wouw so i was lucky afther all
[5:52:19] Kelticlore: you mean Nolak

[5:53:44] senseofpurpose90: what mod to check what items do u already have? is it allofthething?
[5:53:53] dalaraz: they should remove the covenant specify from mounts imo
[5:53:56] spiked16: 4th
[5:54:00] instant_savage: 4
[5:54:39] aurelius0416: I got that Mount by accident lol
[5:54:48] dalaraz: by the moment oyu can spam switch covenants,its silly to lock em behind covenant,it is just time consuming
[5:54:58] Alepouditsa: it will drop now
[5:54:59] Trignus: have to say dragonpenis
[5:55:01] Calphurnious: krippPray ez mount inc
[5:55:08] Eggz1004: at the very least they should do it on the last patch of this expansion so those still farming it can do it in later expansions without having to worry about picking factions
[5:55:19] Moobot: @ZIQOFTW with the host for 966 viewers! towHAMUP
[5:55:28] at1c: pull the ripcord :P

[5:59:04] zoovthepally: I’ve been enjoying PvP by the honor grind is  certainly awful

[6:05:06] Blasphehmy: Do your Garrison for 10 minutes, then play to gear
[6:05:21] OhNoNotAgain: on my way
[6:05:38] mmrghost7: they need something like mythic+ level of idea , something that ppl get addicted to
[6:05:59] amricatt: I do have to say that I like that flying was behind the covenants rather than the rep grind.
[6:06:07] Kevato: Yes! Addiction, woho.
[6:06:19] stryngs_: gw2 is exactly what i was gonna say
[6:06:25] bioreducto: ya mythic plus is like greater rifts from diablo
[6:06:35] Alepouditsa: i like the eso quests
[6:06:39] Poriand: we need more reasons to do older content. more reasons to world pvp. housing.
[6:06:40] notdustinx: Mythic+ was amazing intro in wow

[6:08:02] Shadowlemur01: @omidimaru my sentiment too
[6:08:03] notdustinx: Timewalking is great but need more play through reasoning
[6:08:09] stryngs_: @omidimaru your problem isnt the content, its how many times you have to do it and how attatched it is to power
[6:08:19] Mecabeast: the bosses cycle same order
[6:08:20] mmrghost7: world quest was fun for legion after that it was kinda frustrating
[6:08:22] acting_the_maggot_: true @stryngs_
[6:08:22] Frozen_DK: would it be better to allow less Addons in WoW ? like FF14 has basically none if i recall correctly ?
[6:08:40] orizont2k: Nice to see that Towelliee still have hope and he is optimistic :) Lets check together the trend of wow when the Lost Ark will be released next month !
[6:08:44] rivera9: u bought it for 5K anima
[6:08:46] Bahamut145: Yeah, you can buy that one
[6:09:00] TheUnknowing: ff14 has addons, just not widely used @Frozen_DK and no, i dont think it would make a difference if WoW had less addons
[6:09:07] at1c: wierd system
[6:09:10] Trobbels: Sabriel is the one that drops the mount afaik
[6:09:34] Frozen_DK: aight, thanks for the reply

[6:09:59] koko316: I would love to see a raid done without addons like the old days
[6:10:11] at1c: after playing swtor I miss addons
[6:10:23] whisperlude: what do you get for doing this?
[6:10:28] mmrghost7: go for mythic raid+ :)
[6:10:33] VerdeSol3: Where are the "I took out your comm leadership and your are in the dark" boys?
[6:10:47] Syllvn: I had Addons in the old days?
[6:10:48] Mecabeast: there's orbs in the 4 corners with the bosses so you can process of Elim figure out what you still need for that day
[6:10:49] TheUnknowing: dbm came fairly quickly as it is i believe
[6:10:50] my_feethurt: I have been farming the ZG mounts for years now still nothing
[6:10:55] orizont2k: Hey Towelliee you think that 9.2 will bring people back ???
[6:10:55] jona096e: When do you think 9.2 will drop? :)
[6:10:56] ahquhfeenuh: look at ur details and see which one uve fought
[6:11:06] at1c: Same I had addons in vanilla
[6:11:17] at1c: cosmos for added bars
[6:11:18] KGB_Habs: Decursive was op
[6:11:30] PattiFord: PowerAuras, haha
[6:11:31] Mecabeast: dragon is atleast your 3rd on monk cause you did 4 arm and pit lord
[6:11:31] pacificmc1: Factos
[6:11:31] at1c: before they where added in patches
[6:11:32] stryngs_: If they stopped abandoning things they put in the game mage tower,  torghast when 10.0 drops, warfronts, island expiditions, and kept improving them, maybe we wouldnt have to keep grinding the same things in the current xpac so much
[6:11:33] SavageCheez: CT Mod
[6:11:35] Shadowlemur01: Nah raiding is good, open world is shit
[6:11:40] whisperlude: What do you get for killing all the theater of pain bosses?
[6:11:58] instant_savage: u need the big ugly demon
[6:11:58] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:12:06] mozavich: @koko316 no such thing. take it from someone who had world first rag, we used addons. lots of lots of addons.
[6:12:17] blade23master: I do not think 10.0 will be up until end of the year
[6:12:24] tumb_tack: I maintain, islands reskinned as afterlifes would have been great, like random cultures we never heard of
[6:12:42] orizont2k: @blade23master if they will release it this year :)

[6:12:47] ahquhfeenuh: islands were trash
[6:12:54] mmrghost7: warfronts LUL
[6:12:57] at1c: want new mage towers
[6:13:01] temp3st98: Warfronts ¨puke¨
[6:13:04] im_capy: Garrisons....show me the money!
[6:13:04] Kulture1: remember beta torghast?
[6:13:05] binkz77: i want the challenge mode back
[6:13:05] shade_of_arun: warfronts ResidentSleeper
[6:13:06] tomcruise210: visions were cool but they can stay in bfa
[6:13:09] stryngs_: thats what i mean, they could do a good version of all those things, but they always just give up
[6:13:10] gking3000: Jailers tower
[6:13:19] Poriand: i want solo content thats worth doing. for mounts/ transmog and you can sell or keep.
[6:13:21] amricatt: I like the idea of torghast and/ or mage tower. I think it should be retained but made better.
[6:13:22] tumb_tack: yah new mage towers, new islands with better goals, different visions.. I am down for that
[6:13:23] Mecabeast: I think some people want to scale their toon down for specific old content
[6:13:25] board4life65: warfront was easy gear for ALTS
[6:13:38] koko316: @koko316 True enough. But that would be a true challenge for sure or no PTR for bosses like FF does.
[6:13:39] oscarius: im just pissed they removed mage tower to quickly didn't have the time to do all classes during Christmas time
[6:13:40] BattleKnoedel: i really like the concept of visions, they were fun
[6:13:52] tomcruise210: visions were dope ya
[6:14:05] im_capy: I wish you could choose to lock yourself into an expansion when you create a toon, where it scaled correctly, not through locking our XP
[6:14:05] orizont2k: sadly the 9xxx expansion of wow overall is dead
[6:14:08] at1c: legion talent systems was great that could have been expanded on
[6:14:14] mavericks312: if blizz would have carried over old systems ppl would have called them lazy
[6:14:33] Velarn435: Combine Proving Grounds and mage tower, first it teaches you the basics, then at advanced levels you get rewards.
[6:14:36] Rubbadubdub418: i can back for legion timewalking and was disappointed cause I thought it was new not the same old boss just made harder
[6:14:37] Mecabeast: visions were a great idea and I'd like to see it elaborated on with less grindy currency to do them
[6:14:39] Mallaes: Squish!
[6:14:40] happybooger: whelp LUL
[6:14:41] orizont2k: remake wow :))) remake lore :))) remake blizzard

[6:15:58] orizont2k: are you gonna play Lost Ark ?
[6:16:05] warrenny: @mozavich Ashbringer?
[6:16:12] Mecabeast: True but visions had a chance at decentish gear
[6:16:17] mozavich: @warrenny yah
[6:16:20] ahquhfeenuh: yes
[6:16:23] gold9871: rare yes
[6:16:25] stryngs_: class order expansion would be pretty fire too
[6:16:31] orizont2k: Nice !
[6:16:34] ahquhfeenuh: its a rare but doesnt count as the 4 @Towelliee
[6:16:36] Mecabeast: that's necro only mount drop
[6:16:45] warrenny: @mozavich Same shattered ashbringer plus nm antorus is my default mog
[6:17:06] mozavich: @warrenny so good
[6:17:20] stryngs_: this guy said darnassus just to hurt me :(
[6:17:34] shimwood: It would have been cool to do all of the capitals
[6:17:39] happybooger: i could see Ironforge being really cool
[6:17:43] Angrydoodle: Woulda been Fire
[6:17:48] flebbooo: Yeah if visions had more vareity i would have loved it so much more
[6:17:48] falldrgn: The intro quest line was that iirc
[6:17:52] BattleKnoedel: we were tho
[6:17:56] whisperlude: we did that
[6:17:57] Autoexeq: we were though
[6:17:59] Zorikune: Halls of Origination Dunegon vision and being able to take on those bosses again.
[6:18:01] falldrgn: they had a quest where you had to gather souls  and failed
[6:18:02] warrenny: Darnassus visions would br hot
[6:18:03] whisperlude: yes
[6:18:06] stryngs_: it was a little short
[6:18:09] futomara01: i saved like 1 night  elf
[6:18:13] Poriand: we need something like PoE maps like rifts
[6:18:18] LadyJasmin: yes as an alliance i was in there
[6:18:24] Fray24_: My Night Elf's face burn says so
[6:18:26] orizont2k: Basically the visions are patch specific ! and they try to do shadowlands specific with the torghast  !
[6:18:30] JustLold: If we were in court, we'd be found guilty.
[6:18:38] Mecabeast: I didn't start playing wow till bfa launch so I missed that prepatch sadge
[6:18:41] JustLold: :P
[6:18:43] Nilllan: hello, just wanted to say im really enjoying the streams :)
[6:18:51] orizont2k: vision is the = to torghast
[6:19:00] happybooger: that vision would have triggered so many alliance players LUL
[6:19:03] pacificmc1: KEKW
[6:19:06] BoiAtomico: flying whales
[6:19:06] pacificmc1: true
[6:19:07] Aidler: I was in Darnassus during that time and nothing happened Kappa
[6:19:17] mavericks312: we need sky whales
[6:19:17] warrenny: @mecabeast Lucky you it sucked as a horde player
[6:19:18] falldrgn: if it learned.. it would put in an whole patch about pulling rip cords
[6:19:21] benitezlalo: What do you think next expansion will be about?
[6:19:46] orizont2k: Towelliee they dont want to invest, they have the money but they are greedy to invest thats it
[6:20:02] Nilllan: i would love a dragon isles expansion, would be cool
[6:20:09] griffdog125: Brawlers guild
[6:20:12] bestplayereu99: next xpac playable ogre pls
[6:20:12] BoiAtomico: 1st world boss will be flying moby dick
[6:20:16] Masqerader: WOW won't be great till we have a DUCK mount
[6:20:17] warrenny: Sky whales? Like purgil in star wars?
[6:20:23] stryngs_: @orizont2k i think they just to solidify their staff, i think they want to do better, its just too much blizzard BS is affecting the game
[6:20:31] Nilllan: @Masqerader TRUEEE
[6:20:46] bumpstock75: that a daliy boss for necro
[6:20:46] r0b928: No we need dragon knights
[6:20:51] shimwood: Rubber Ducky mount or RIOT!
[6:20:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: The snail mount looked badass
[6:21:26] Waspire: just wait when wow classic mobile
[6:21:28] zeiours: Wow needs to put another horse in the game for alliance, that will save it.
[6:21:29] stat15t1c: but why would they invest back into desktop if mobile is printing money?
[6:21:31] tomcruise210: the wasp mount looks cool too
[6:21:32] Waspire: luanches
[6:21:32] orizont2k: As you can see in the gaming industry right now, they want to make money from remaster / remake... no new systems / no new game design / no new different game ! They dont want to risk in the new idea's  because of the factor of the unknown !
[6:21:33] lithium364: the last game i played on my phone was snake
[6:21:37] lithium364: 20 years ago
[6:21:44] Nokterian: LUL

[6:23:31] MeisterPetze: wow gfx are totaly fine and i love them
[6:23:37] stryngs_: i will say though,these shadowlands zones look awesome

[6:23:49] Krewger_: Doesn't this mount only drop from the necrolord daily quest boss??
[6:23:55] mmrghost7: i wonder if  i will actually see 2073
[6:23:55] markogbbjj: This dude is funny as hell
[6:23:57] Nilllan: @SpartanD84 Same bro, its just something special about them
[6:24:15] at1c: moving a game over you have to re doo all delvopers tools
[6:24:15] givmeafrekinname: @Krewger_ No. It has a chance to drop from any of the 4

[6:24:47] sentouX: that's a follow from me
[6:24:59] MeisterPetze: wow graphics are just timeless. new world will look like shit in 5 years
[6:25:00] Waspire: but i wouldnt mind a unreal style  for wow
[6:25:06] lithium364: mobile engine
[6:25:10] twistedstick1: wow 2.0
[6:25:18] orizont2k: What if WoW will go NFT ? How will impact the game ?
[6:25:20] markogbbjj: @SpartanD84 100%
[6:25:21] pacificmc1: They have to be careful with WoW engine too, not everyone has good enough PC
[6:25:25] mAiKa_______: I dont want wow to look different I like how it looks now
[6:25:27] at1c: @orizont2k games wont go nft
[6:25:27] magiccanvashands: they need to bury world of warcraft just cut it loose and let it fall
[6:25:32] warrenny: Wouldnt new wow engine need wow 2?
[6:25:37] zardistus: @sentoux towelliee is one of the few real deal dudes around.  tells it like it is, which is what I dig about him

[6:26:00] ahquhfeenuh: WoW going to each char having 5 Million polygons KEKW
[6:26:06] markogbbjj: I don't need it always to be realistic. These graphics are fine. SWTOR graphics are also fine.
[6:26:10] sentouX: @zardistus aye my man, i dig the same in this regard
[6:26:18] magiccanvashands: I mean look at it this way if there was a wow 2 where and what would the story line be?
[6:26:28] Streamcrush: wow could look better than this, it already looks better than it did back in 2004
[6:26:37] Convectus: i feel like 'wow 2'
[6:26:42] Convectus: began in cata
[6:26:51] orizont2k: Wow token replaced in someway by NFT ?

[6:28:51] Nokterian: it aged like fine wine
[6:29:00] magiccanvashands: @Towelliee who does not want to play a game that is up to date?
[6:29:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: WoW was working good in 4K before many others
[6:29:03] Nilllan: Wows music beats everything in this world
[6:29:04] Vch001: I need to try out Blade and Soul's new graphics
[6:29:07] amricatt: My potato won't play a lot of the new MMOs.  I'm not in a position to buy a new computer for a game I may or may not like.  I at least know I love WoW.
[6:29:08] Rygel_XVII: GW2 looks alright at best
[6:29:09] stryngs_: id like to see them spruce up the capital cities graphically though thatd be cool
[6:29:28] Robodope: I think SWTOR could easily look a lot better if they just upgraded character models
[6:29:29] orizont2k: WoW nowadays wants more system requirements compared with 2005..... for just a few details here and there like water, fog, spells !
[6:29:37] Robix256: bring together 50-100 players in wow, see what happens KEKW

[6:29:57] h00rayforstuff: I also think the graphical style for wow just ages better. Does a better of hiding it's age
[6:29:58] Zak_00: @Hayon5 Amen
[6:30:21] Robodope: well yea thats a lot of work though you'd probably have to recreate most of the assets
[6:30:35] stallion2896: @Towelliee what kind of headset you using
[6:30:39] Sarkerius: EVE online is a beautiful game. But has also recived pretty constant major grafics updates, and requires a decent PC

[6:32:11] Hayon5: Do lost Ark need a good config ?
[6:32:31] magemaster225: horizon already leaked
[6:32:33] deeerow: i hope gw2 gets delayed so i dont have to play right now lol
[6:32:35] Robodope: didn't star wars already delay
[6:32:39] orizont2k: they dont have blizzcon so no more announcements ..... how they will manage announcements ? like random this is the next expansion ?
[6:32:45] Sollice: @Mecabeast Everything is more expensive. Doesn't make a difference though you still wont be able to buy it
[6:32:49] Eggz1004: when do you think wow 10.0 would be released? this year or next year?

[6:33:33] wEiRdO_dUdE: A year in 9.2? Ouch
[6:33:43] stryngs_: @fearkiller1234 u beat the game, play somehting else
[6:33:47] ChimmyNeutron: @weirdo_dude What do you expect?
[6:33:47] red_renji: 10.0 2023 q1 is a good bet, i have lots of content to do in wow so i dont kind
[6:33:52] Robodope: last patch always a year of torture.  and I dunno if 9.2 is even the last patch
[6:33:52] orizont2k: So until next year Lost Ark :)))) or other game
[6:33:57] magiccanvashands: I wonder how many sexual assault cases Blizz will have this year.... is more like it
[6:33:58] Merkabee: meatball sandwhich
[6:34:09] Ghostzapp3r: Tell me more about the Wrath PLUS please sir
[6:34:14] Hayon5: WOLTK  late 2022
[6:34:15] deckardblade: Wrath classic this year?
[6:34:16] ahquhfeenuh: welp
[6:34:25] ahquhfeenuh: Portal 2 just got steam deck verified, first game for that one
[6:34:25] Hayon5: WOLTK will tank for 10.0
[6:34:26] tomcruise210: i cant wait for wrath classic tbh
[6:34:32] stryngs_: wrath plus is just wrath but with the jailer creeping in the background
[6:34:33] h00rayforstuff: when do you think it's announced? right after 9.2?
[6:34:42] Cosmolus: @Towelliee why are double legendary rep gated ?
[6:34:42] MaxFel18: Last Time we had to wait +1 year in the same patch we got legion so im good on waiting
[6:34:44] fearkiller1234: kinda feel like were in it now
[6:34:47] sentouX: i think im time capsuling miself in wotlk :> i just love it
[6:34:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: They were using Classic in offyears, Wrath would be 2023
[6:34:52] toolate95: wait we haven't been in the drought besides timewalking keystone and mage tower ???
[6:34:52] Eggz1004: the drought is only going to be like 4-6 months i think
[6:34:55] Ghostzapp3r: You say PLUS. And i think brand new content
[6:35:01] red_renji: @towelliee everyone is really negative about wow, and i really enjoy retail and find it disheartening at times, im really hopeful for 10.0, are you personally hopeful/excited for it?
[6:35:05] Sollice: @Eggz1004 ? How do you figure.
[6:35:06] ahquhfeenuh: 16 months of garrosh getting sad at thrall
[6:35:08] ChimmyNeutron: @weirdo_dude Wrath will be this fall/winter
[6:35:17] ashwing_: LUL
[6:35:23] Jeraiya2: LUL
[6:35:30] Cosmolus: 8-12 months
[6:35:30] warrenny: Judging expac based on draught is dumb af
[6:35:31] Acidwalk: I think it will be close to legion
[6:35:34] Cosmolus: minimum
[6:35:54] Sollice: @warrenny It's not. You have to keep content coming at a semi regular pace
[6:35:56] smashwow: 12-16 months
[6:36:05] ahquhfeenuh: I think Wrath Classic is gonna be out a little bit, they are still kinda reeling from the Server issues TBC classic had and they want a solution for it before they run into it again
[6:36:05] iRage1776: @Towelliee gives me time to max all of my toons LUL LUL
[6:36:06] griffdog125: Ya fking Jabroni
[6:36:07] lalelusa: if, and that's really IF they bring out a new class with 10.0, they should release it earlier for pre-orders just so people will re-sub sooner
[6:36:17] haplessoverlook: interesting
[6:36:21] orizont2k: when the 10. version will come I will play it if I have or see the old mindset of the blizzard-activision in that patch I will just quit for good !
[6:36:24] fearkiller1234: wrath is gona get folks to resub
[6:36:33] toolate95: so more excuses for longer droughts grear
[6:36:35] red_renji: if new xpac os q1 2023 when do we expect an announcement
[6:36:37] toolate95: great*
[6:36:37] warrenny: @sollice You want rushed bad content or slow good content?
[6:36:46] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think Classic Wrath is coming this year
[6:36:48] Cosmolus: Wow has literally almost unaffected quarte finance balance  LUL
[6:36:53] ahquhfeenuh: Classic Wrath will be 2023
[6:36:54] Sollice: @warrenny It has nothing to do with me and it has everything to do with competition
[6:37:09] TheUnknowing: take as long as they need, 10.0 NEEDS to be good
[6:37:16] fearkiller1234: ive been anti classic this whole time but i think wraith is gona suck me in not gona lie
[6:37:17] andrewexiled: maybe not more money but those MAUs are gonna be through the roof cause of mobile.
[6:37:22] red_renji: i wouldnt mind a 2 year drought so the devs can have the time needed to make a good xpac,
[6:37:22] Heero_Effect: There’s plenty of games out there to play in the meantime haha
[6:37:25] WhiteKnight74648: Its my expansion and I want it now. Call JT Wentworth.  877 cash now!

[6:37:32] TERMINATOR_XFX: hi do any of you know when will the new patch 9.2 come?
[6:37:44] smashwow: idk. SoO was a long drought and we got WoD. WoD was a long drought and we got Legion. i'd say drought length is a 50/50 metric on how good the next xpac is. @Towelliee
[6:37:44] orizont2k: try not to pre order I guess :)) wait for the reviews or Towelliee gameplay
[6:37:52] Heero_Effect: @terminator_xfx soon
[6:37:55] Ertra: mau?
[6:38:02] fearkiller1234: as long as fall guys 3 hits soon
[6:38:07] DinkytheDoodle: @Towelliee but look at how long it took for SL to release and the pushbacks they did to it's release date. By your logic SL should have been AMAZING based on how long it took to release...and it had LOTS of issues on release that weren't fixed til 9.1.5 and some are still in there.
[6:38:14] red_renji: SoO was a fine drought since MoP was amazing
[6:38:14] smashwow: yup i said that
[6:38:27] Cosmolus: 10.0 needs to be better than Legion
[6:38:34] ahquhfeenuh: we had mop pvp, thats what saved SoO
[6:38:41] pacificmc1: why do you think it will be?
[6:38:42] red_renji: 10.0 should bring back artifact weapons

[6:39:01] ashwing_: Legion prior to 7.2 KEKW
[6:39:05] fearkiller1234: *think
[6:39:05] warrenny: Lol that’s unlikely
[6:39:12] toolate95: but with what our saying mobile is there play which will allow them to not focus wow, they will focus on money maker in mobile meaning longer droughts

[6:40:02] NickLeonhearth: breast milk...what?

[6:40:29] Heero_Effect: I mean I work from home due to pandemic. I can’t use an excuse
[6:40:34] WhiteKnight74648: For me FF has more to offer per exnasion based off the content
[6:40:36] thedr8993: also japan vs usa response
[6:40:39] red_renji: ffxiv is overrated i have more play time in it then wow, hating wow is just a fad
[6:40:39] thedr8993: not comparable
[6:40:41] fearkiller1234: is final fantasy winning due to their countries policys on the virus you think?

[6:49:55] orizont2k: On shadowlands is a bit annoying that we don't know much about Arthas, because he was a big shot overall in shadowlands lore.
[6:49:59] Stringerrs: so ther is no 9.3? sorry bit out of the loop
[6:50:00] fearkiller1234: whats the hype on top DPS in the PTR? for 9.2

[6:50:10] spiked16: do long story short... theres gonna be another long draught ?
[6:50:17] ahquhfeenuh: after over promising shadowlands date, easily i see 10.0 in march/april/may
[6:50:20] instant_savage: are u 100% sure we dont get  9.3 with one of those bandaids 2 boss raids
[6:50:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: I don't think there has to be a 9.2.5
[6:50:25] Fray24_: So this raid tier about to last a year???? fuuuuu
[6:50:27] ahquhfeenuh: of 2023
[6:50:44] warrenny: @spiked16 So next expac will be good but the world sucks atm
[6:50:48] orizont2k: I dont get it, why is hard to develop from home ? for security reasons or what ?
[6:51:02] Fray24_: I started at the end of BFA so yeah lol
[6:51:04] HyirGaming: The setup took the longest
[6:51:06] fearkiller1234: idk in BFA we had mini raids in between
[6:51:09] lithium364: its 10.0 soonish but still no devilsaur mount sadge
[6:51:14] ahquhfeenuh: bro id be down for a story only 9.3 patch, jujst some push along
[6:51:16] HyirGaming: Now that they are setup they are g2g
[6:51:24] Andymint: its silly to have the pandemic be an excuse. Studies have shown that in most cases productivity went up when people started working from home
[6:51:31] spiked16: @warrenny shadowlands was gonna be also a good expac...but look were it is right now
[6:51:38] warrenny: @fearkiller1234 1 mini raid which was meh
[6:51:51] warrenny: @spiked16 pretty good
[6:51:53] Howitzer1028: as someone who is currently working from home, yes i am more productive in the office
[6:52:00] Timmychanz: Damn I miss wow, is it still bustling? Venthyr was fun on my arms
[6:52:13] fearkiller1234: imagine if they weren't based in CA...lol
[6:52:15] BoiAtomico: take into account that they can't sexually harrass people working from home, that demoralizes the work force KEKW
[6:52:16] manis_tv: if ur trying for the mount im pretty sure it only drops from the 1st rare  u kill
[6:52:19] andrewexiled: @orizont2k almost every game company has suffered because of it especially for big games so it nots just blizzard.
[6:52:22] mavericks312: HzD 2 delayed GoW 2 delayed
[6:52:25] LilHeZi24: fun fact one of the kids that created among us went to my school
[6:52:31] orizont2k: Overall as per statistics ... many companies had %%% increase in productivity !
[6:52:32] thedr8993: it's silly to say it DIDN"T have an effect
[6:52:43] xibah2510: You can still sexually harass someone while working from home.
[6:52:59] fearkiller1234: well in fairness you are talking to MMO players who dont go outside so...lol
[6:53:11] BoiAtomico: @xibah2510 Yeah, but it's harder
[6:53:14] awoozwow: I work from home (doing non creative software engineering) and am far more productive, but I could see why in a creative job (such as game design) where bouncing ideas off each other is important I could see being in office being better.
[6:53:18] mavericks312: mmo players dont touch grass usually
[6:53:19] ahquhfeenuh: @Towelliee clearly as we've seen with many delays the GAMING industry suffered from the pandemic.
[6:53:20] bob_the_demon: But haven't they said multiple times in their investor calls that the COVID WFH situation is NOT slowing down their development?
[6:53:23] onybear: I couldn’t even imagine trying to make a game during this time…
[6:53:30] manis_tv: ya handy notes says the first rare u kill daily has a chance for the mount
[6:53:35] orizont2k: That’s reflected in corporate profits, which rose 10.5% in the second quarter to a record $2.8 trillion. Strikingly, that was achieved with fewer people working: Non-farm payrolls in June were still down by some 6.6 million from pre-pandemic levels.
[6:53:51] smashwow: does it have an impact. yes. but you can take a lot of steps to minimize the impact. investing in the proper tech for WFH.
[6:54:07] Lulaboo: People saying all sorts of shit to please investors
[6:54:08] h00rayforstuff: feel like big diff between working my office job with pdfs and spreadsheets at home than working game dev at home
[6:54:14] Lulaboo: and shareholders
[6:54:19] brockusgames: 2+2=4, its obv going to cause delays. Potential time off for lost love ones, personal sickness, not every company was ready for home working or the transition to it.
[6:54:23] instant_savage: yeah but how hard is to dev cod, its pretty much the same game every year
[6:54:23] HyirGaming: Or maybe they are longer getting behind?
[6:54:36] Angrydoodle: you also need to reorganize massive teams to working from home instead of in office
[6:54:42] Waspire: that cod....made acti so much cash...
[6:54:46] Sollice: @orizont2k You do not understand how game pipelines work. Shadowlands was affected by COVID when people were just moving to home and companies had to figure it out.
[6:54:48] xibah2510: 9.2. looks boring and grindy
[6:54:51] Heero_Effect: I think CoD teams were impacted. Vanguard was horrible, and took forever for warzone to get a new map.
[6:55:14] Zivs: lol what part looks grindy?
[6:55:15] fearkiller1234: do they actually develop call of duty anymore or just like reskin their old maps...lol
[6:55:15] banNickk: terrible
[6:55:16] andrewexiled: you just have to look at major releases in the next month or two and games being delayed. These types of games dont normally come out early Q1. Covid is the only logical explanation.
[6:55:22] Short_Film: Warzone struggling with alot of bugs, glitches
[6:55:23] juicejacoby: vanguard is the worst title
[6:55:28] manis_tv: ya wish i never bought it
[6:55:30] Nytaha: it's not bcs they are "lazy" but they have bad set up reporting & management, if they would be more flexible before they wouldn't have problem to adjust to the pandemic
[6:55:31] smashwow: there was probably close to 2 months of development lost on the initial COVID logistics screw job.
[6:55:31] juicejacoby: shit is garBAGGGGEEE
[6:55:36] Short_Film: Cold War was worse than Vanguard tho
[6:55:46] juicejacoby: cap ^
[6:55:48] warrenny: Cod been meh since like bo4
[6:55:54] NILLme: activision fired most of the vanguard QA, not surprising
[6:56:08] tomcruise210: cod been meh since BLOPS 2
[6:56:10] Razznab: battlefield 2042 and vanguard ruined my hopes for an annual fps release lol
[6:56:24] Heero_Effect: I like CoD like I have fun I go through phases I dig it and go hard
[6:56:32] bumpstock75: she's a dalily for nocro  players, they call her and others up to kill.
[6:56:35] stryngs_: @Razznab battlefiail 204poo
[6:56:44] Sollice: @Towelliee People who make the comments about COVID not affecting work do not understand how large companies who have multiple teams working on things together be seperate work.
[6:57:02] xibah2510: activation never had a good reputation.
[6:57:07] Short_Film: i feel like covid effecting the quality of movies too. not as many great ones
[6:57:28] r0b928: 100% Covid affected blizzard
[6:57:32] pacificmc1: All the good ones are being delayed tho cos not ideal time to release them @Short_Film
[6:57:35] fearkiller1234: @Short_Film i agree! but its because most films and games are made in CA..
[6:57:37] foshiXD: Lol top gun was supposed to be released like 2 years ago and they keep postponing cause they want money from the box office
[6:57:47] steinhofff: at the same time we have to admit that the pandemic did bring people back to gaming
[6:57:52] steinhofff: so they did somehow benefit out of it
[6:57:55] Razznab: i just think many developers are jumping on the "delaying till its ready" meta to hide from the major development issues and they still release a game that has many flaws.

[6:58:01] brockusgames: prot warrior really needs some more mob control
[6:58:04] twinkieruler95: have you messed around on ptr ?
[6:58:33] thedr8993: they nuked it man
[6:58:34] Stringerrs: ring door Kappa
[6:58:35] thedr8993: after bgfa
[6:58:38] xibah2510: what part of 9.2 are you excited for @hindenbergg
[6:58:42] jek_wi: Ring door!!
[6:58:53] grapyz: Its turret in M+ is it not
[6:58:56] thedr8993: i really liked it in bfa, and blizz absolutely obliterated
[6:58:56] bigpatc: feel like anything but arms is booty
[6:58:59] fearkiller1234: its the magic dmg.. i hurts bad for prot
[6:59:01] twinkieruler95: i really hope they change the talent system that needs reworked
[6:59:10] grapyz: Oh I thought you said prot pally
[6:59:16] grapyz: my bad lol
[6:59:24] brockusgames: Interrupting shout in MoP is a reasonable move, not too much but not too bad.
[6:59:28] BoiAtomico: warriors be manly tho
[6:59:39] thedr8993: ofc
[6:59:44] bigdaddystunna: they better
[6:59:53] sintm_: Magic dmg reduc conduit would be nice
[7:00:01] grapyz: Bulwark and and the divine toll leggo
[7:00:02] MexicanMisker: prot warrior was "Chad-tier" for most of BFA, they fallen pretty hard
[7:00:02] grapyz: lol
[7:00:03] manis_tv: imfiredup was testing double legos in a 20 NW so id assume
[7:00:07] orizont2k: 9.2 will allows us 2 legendary for sure.... it will pe the = to corruptions in BFA
[7:00:10] fearkiller1234: hero leap with prot warrior and wall would be cool as hell
[7:00:27] NILLme: would be weird if you are allowed to use 2 legendaries only in the raid
[7:00:30] xibah2510: imagine 2 of the same legendary.
[7:00:42] svicaa: Towelliee you are a Island BOIII

[7:04:04] svicaa: @Towelliee When Patch 9.2 Drops, please make the Island Boii hairstyle.
[7:04:07] MrGattz: isnt the whole world just one giant island?
[7:04:13] jhonny1339: i agree but people bash alot... they want to get free all stuff so people become aids
[7:04:20] dracullus: I just noticed you can craft new lego on every slot, not only waist like they said before @Towelliee
[7:04:38] warrenny: How dare we have to earn shit
[7:04:41] orizont2k: Hey Towelliee you think that wow will adopt some NFT or CRYPTO in the future ?
[7:04:54] dracullus: I don't think so, keystone master is on curve level
[7:04:57] smashwow: @dracullus that's after you unlock the extra slot outside of the base belt slot for the cov lego
[7:05:00] LutarTV: do you play classic or tbc or only retail? @towelliee
[7:05:06] jhonny1339: do you remeber how we farmed shadoemourn back in wolk? and how much it took to get one... people became so soft
[7:05:14] im_n0t_jezus: KSM mount in 9.2 is worth 9.1 not so much
[7:05:15] PattiFord: is this Reinhardts voice actor for the Rare announcer?
[7:05:18] Ovium56: talk all the shit but will be the first to grind it all and complain theres no content
[7:05:20] TheUnknowing: god i hope not @orizont2k

[7:05:38] N3llee: its the same rep grind as the last xpacs
[7:05:39] warrenny: @jhonny1339 Im trying to get that on my main 😂
[7:05:40] ahquhfeenuh: all the new mini systems are enjoyable
[7:05:40] Bayne77: TO THE COUNCIL!!!
[7:05:41] gurkalicious: Do you need to have done it to know that you don't like it being timegated?
[7:05:43] smashwow: KSM after the revamp to not having to time a key puts it on the AOTC level. it's a real shame
[7:05:44] N3llee: no difference but the name.
[7:05:44] BufuGear: dont u think that wow has currently way too many systems to handle? @Towelliee
[7:05:49] warrenny: @jhonny1339 when i can be nothered
[7:05:51] fearkiller1234: yeh i wouldnt want to play the PTR for that very reason
[7:05:52] grapyz: I think most peeps are just very bored lol
[7:05:53] Drumac_: There are people that bitch just to bitch
[7:05:54] twinkieruler95: have you messed around on the new ptr version?
[7:05:58] Nosdunk24: if you don't like rep grinds, or just "the grind" in general, why are you playing an MMO?
[7:06:18] jhonny1339: who remebers title called INSANE ?
[7:06:21] mavericks312: if you dont like grinding why are you playing mmo's
[7:06:27] waltico90: exacly
[7:06:42] piratechris: You can't talk about rep grind if you havent done the grind in Vanilla (and yes not the recent release but the original vanilla)
[7:06:52] fearkiller1234: random question: is professions getting updated in 9.2?
[7:06:55] piratechris: Todays grinds are a peice of cake compared and fun too
[7:07:05] banNickk: i think alot of the hate also stems from the fact that alot of the love from the past came from the good story and the story is kinda bad rn
[7:07:09] JacksonMCurtis: @fearkiller1234 no, at all
[7:07:14] warrenny: Its the same shit ppl say every patch
[7:07:22] orizont2k: If you played WoW you can play any mmorpg easily lol
[7:07:22] jhonny1339: do you guys know how much it was job to farm title Insane
[7:07:32] banNickk: fair
[7:07:43] piratechris: MMOs need their timesinks. It's as simple as that
[7:07:45] crazy1god: @Towelliee And you will see this PPL don't come out from this ZONES ...
[7:07:55] piratechris: To keep the players coming back. The trick is keeping things interesting
[7:07:58] abstrusegoose: there was a story in classic?
[7:08:25] Waspire: its the human story...  To each thier own!
[7:08:27] warrenny: Just look how split star wars fans are
[7:08:29] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee what do you think of asmongolds take on flying? when the first heroic kill happens on a server you get flying
[7:08:31] Nyytro84: Its like a movie series on the 9th iteration, its just not good anymore
[7:08:40] jhonny1339: ofc there was story in classic for 2004 it was great exp
[7:09:03] thedr8993: @twinkieruler95 that would unlock it day 1
[7:09:06] Sollice: I like Shadowlands story and it's one i want to see carried over to the next expansion. I think it's a good lead up point to something massive
[7:09:08] thedr8993: wouldn't make sense
[7:09:12] jhonny1339: asmongold knows on what sky stands
[7:09:16] CardinalTX: but but but but but Towelliee if i dont like it how can anyone else!? Reeeeeeeeeeee
[7:09:18] fearkiller1234: booty bay had some legit story telliong in classic... big ass gorilla sitting in the middle of the road... the story was me getting my cheeks clapped
[7:09:32] warrenny: Depends on the grind tbh
[7:09:43] Atokad2887: i still prefer classic...but that doesnt mean i dont wanna see retail get better...the goal shouldnt be to play an older version of the game it should always be to move forward...but for now TBC is where i stay
[7:09:43] grapyz: some people want wow to play like cod, just wait in a lobby and get straight to it
[7:09:44] lovemymage: grinds fine as long as long its not korthia kind of grind
[7:09:47] Howitzer1028: I dont understand why people want to be done with the game as soon as possible, wouldnt you want to be kept playing stuff especially for stuff that isnt power related
[7:09:54] jhonny1339: @fearkiller1234 there was alot of characters in storys who were intresting
[7:09:59] mavericks312: give me a thanos story over a daredevil story anydya
[7:10:25] MrFariaH: one thing I really hate is not having the full story in the game, and have to check  a bunch of books for details. thats mad....

[7:21:07] Angrydoodle: portals are just for the quest itself
[7:21:08] fearkiller1234: portals arent for the achievement
[7:21:20] board4life65: no
[7:21:51] orizont2k: if you dont use the right spell you wont get the achievement !
[7:22:58] fearkiller1234: if they are in stone its 3 if they are dazed its 2
[7:22:59] bioreducto: Maybe you need to update your addons
[7:23:00] orizont2k: Watch a video is the best, because you need the specific spell for each one in order to get achievement
[7:23:46] Darthyrevan: sorry just got here what's he trying to do?
[7:23:47] BoiAtomico: the heal does not remove them from the stone tho, so if they're in stone, it has to be 3
[7:23:59] orizont2k: you can done the quest with the heal only  but you wont get the achievement
[7:24:04] orizont2k: check youtube video
[7:24:49] Angrydoodle: doesnt matter

[7:27:47] thedr8993: as long as they're helped you get credit
[7:27:56] orizont2k: that is important because I did it random and and I didn't get the achievement
