[3:55:04] nickas31: I think pain is so weird... if you get good pain reliever it goes away temporarily
[3:55:24] el_agu_89: Desi the G xD
[3:55:38] nickas31: but the teeth is still damaged yet you just dont feel the pain.. one reason I dont believe in evoloution is pain.. we would have evolved past pain along time ago
[3:55:47] PhoenixPresence: @nickas31 well it doesnt actually go away, your brain just stops registering it.
[3:55:55] nickas31: @PhoenixPresence right
[3:56:01] PhoenixPresence: Pain is a friend, showing us where in our bodies needs attention
[3:56:16] nickas31: @PhoenixPresence to a point you are correct but once we know we should be able to turn it off
[3:56:56] nickas31: this fight looks the most fun

[4:00:36] Setupwizard: hard to track everything even with addons
[4:00:36] PhoenixPresence: Dual spec in SoD, maybe, so like its not gonna be Classic+ anymore at some point, because essentially retail is just classic with 10923345035 quality of life upgrades
