[1:08:43] grylz89: @xaryu I'm one of the founding players of HC, and I had some bad experiences with HC elites top officers / GM. I can honestly can see why he's done this multiple times. Tho, it's pretty FN gnarly behavior.
[1:08:49] foshanks: @Gyrospeter Wastes your lifetime?

[1:10:11] Sqwibbie: gg
[1:10:14] Ragi_Fz: @Xaryu If it's anything like runescape, creating a variety in activities slows down detection and increases profit :)
[1:10:18] demonzhunter: blizzered
[1:10:20] 1cyveins: @Sqwibbie new account KEKW
[1:10:24] jdtopgun93: why dont they ban the gold buyers?
[1:10:26] NareeM: what happened with p2 41yards nameplates?
[1:10:27] tuna_sandw1ch: remove WoW from asia
[1:10:27] daLuhz: they are trying under the condition that they can automate it without throwing any money at the issue
[1:10:27] Llynok: ban 50% of Hunters, easy

[1:10:39] NashvilleCrook: but blizz loves bots free money
[1:10:41] Kilbraa: buy gold? like, for real money?o.O
[1:10:42] cactavius: lmao that is never happening
[1:10:42] larnsmarf: itll never happen. because then they lose 50 percent of the player base
[1:10:43] yakattack1738: gn half the player base!
[1:10:43] geo_tek: Yes please!
[1:10:44] StreamElements: Stay connected in Discord -> https://discord.gg/xaryu
[1:10:46] justin022222: they could prolly cap mailing gold too
[1:10:48] cheevzzz: I never bought gold and got a ban for gold buying once
[1:10:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @NashvilleCrook actually not true
[1:10:51] grebby71: HC raid guilds need to personally vet everyone now, like demanding real names, video interviews,  etc.
[1:10:51] chrisrev: youre gonna make the price of gold go up stop
[1:10:52] pixixx1: unless you're a famous streamer ofc
[1:10:52] tsetse2fly: @Xaryu Sorry Xar, but private servers did a better job
[1:10:54] jewfest: wont do anything that way
[1:10:54] Reaperz_kinetic: @mmp5453 it really doesnt lol but kk
[1:11:01] v0ak: you dont get banned for buying gold?
[1:11:01] Kilbraa: real money for gold in wow? loool o.O
[1:11:01] BigUnknownGamer: so if someone lese buys gold and they trades it all parties should be perma?!?!  @Xaryu
[1:11:01] Griffzke: blizz wont perma ban for gold buying because they will lose HALF of their population
[1:11:01] Doimos89: and add token to SOD and classic so we can buy gold from blizzard
[1:11:01] buhtterstick: I"ll stop buying gold when they add WoW token
[1:11:02] gezpz: bots are a sub for blizz they won't do shit
[1:11:02] jdtopgun93: god for bid u have to play the game u already pay 15$ for
[1:11:05] budmodeos: it’s like twitter. Twitter ad revenue was completely bloated by bots’
[1:11:05] thesirganks: they used to do that, but if they discovered that people that are permaed just make a new account, while temporary is better detergent
[1:11:07] Sqwibbie: @1cyveins that removes everyone who cant afford multiple accounts that are perma banned.
[1:11:08] bej56: just sucks for us who didnt buy gold in p1 and now all the prices are insane
[1:11:10] larnsmarf: its why NEW WORLD has never ban gold buying. then they would lose 99 percent of player base
[1:11:11] leftlanemedia: leftlanemedia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:11:13] cactavius: blizzard listens to this and laughs at all the money that are making
[1:11:21] sharkmanx78: @cheevzzz just get two accounts buy gold on the burner account ez
[1:11:21] larnsmarf: @bej56 lol i told everyone to buy gold pre phase
[1:11:24] Deceasedcheeks: I think Blizzard actually like the bots because each bot account is a subscription, they don't punish people because they want the bots
[1:11:25] Reaperz_kinetic: @mmp5453 when did i say that KEKW
[1:11:26] heygoditsme: @NashvilleCrook most of the bots dont pay for sub
[1:11:27] reborn2win: @Xaryu Did you get your hair cut or is it just pulled back?
[1:11:27] daLuhz: blizzard is 'trying' under the condition that they will only attempt to solve the issue without hiring any staff
[1:11:31] j_dillinger777: yes
[1:11:32] budmodeos: I bet bots are 25% of subs
[1:11:32] Deomas11: attacking him would flag you

[1:12:13] NashvilleCrook: Hey you nerds lets just relax in chat, Everyone is OK
[1:12:15] jackpepsimba: @mmp5453 all you're doing is playing out the lamest devil's advocate argument I've ever heard
[1:12:19] Reaperz_kinetic: @mmp5453 or i can just think your argument makes you sound like an idiot
[1:12:19] ddevillax: the final boss of ashenvale event has 700k hp, and people easily killed him at 25...

[3:10:26] wavecadet: @lennysbrushes its a boss that gives an aura that doubles, or triples, your blood depending on how close you are
[3:10:27] limburgse: @lennysbrushes its a boss, when you kill peeps around it you get more blood
[3:10:48] Maiqthehighking: shadow priests just dominate

[3:11:24] scoutbeans: it's hard in pvp bc there's basically no time to cast
[3:11:27] Hyperioz: u cant join a raid during event so would be hard to kill the boss without aoeing all ur friends

[3:12:42] M0rley_: I dont think that fixes the problem. I would reather look for a healer then bring a mage
[3:12:48] mellohh4444: @danielbanks false, my guild and I 9 man'd gnomer me as mage healer

[3:16:30] prettypandaren: @Maiqthehighking i was more interested in which abilities mages had, that could save a wipe when something goes wrong
[3:16:31] lateloll: i dont get why someone would want to play some op shit like that, whats the fun in one shotting ppl, takes no skill what so ever

[3:34:28] Reaperz_kinetic: @ShaneiumTheCranium except youre wrong..... the thought that a bone is permanently stronger was disproven but for a short period of time the healed area is stronger due to the dense calcium collection
[3:34:30] tuna_sandw1ch: lift heavy, lots of reps and do it really fast
[3:34:32] ryan___mcg: no doubt no doubt

[3:35:36] ShaneiumTheCranium: @Reaperz_kinetic If youre referring to the literal break itself and not the entirety of the bone then sure. Youre right on a technicality.  But that isnt the whole truth and youre arguing something that again, is a technicality.  The bone is not stronger.

[3:37:08] mandl: this phase melee have a hard time
[3:37:08] probeu: same
[3:37:08] Jdmsir94: week 2 they are saying be geared know fights for the raid lmao, im not even 40 yet

[3:37:23] Reaperz_kinetic: @ShaneiumTheCranium i mean theres no fault to go around we were just missunderstanding
[3:37:24] scivationx: I got told yesterday I'm wrong for running windfury as an enhancement shaman, I need to run double rockbiter
[3:37:25] Witality: welcome to the fun zone :)
[3:37:27] dougburnsplays: people in classic be like CASUAL GUILD: consumes req, checking logs, must have wbuffs etc
[3:37:29] JamesIRL: yea. I didnt get invited to gnomer today because I parsed bad first week lol @Xaryu
[3:37:33] Witality: Horde grouping as always Madge

[3:37:49] BlownFuse_: I mean you kind of have to. we did gnomer last night, invited a melee hunter who averaged 40 dps the whole raid

[3:37:58] hersheyjh: yes
[3:37:58] xOutcoldx: or you rgonna do fail pugs
[3:37:59] Loodimus: Got kicked out of 2 gnomer groups last night cuz I wasnt a top parser lol
[3:38:00] pizac7: cringe gatekeepers
[3:38:00] erassa_: Yes
[3:38:00] myyrlidon: no
[3:38:01] drisan87: lol nah, dad gamers don't care
[3:38:02] alexclark1313: everytime your forming a group you ask for t he best gear
[3:38:03] SghettiBoy: i dont and i found a guild of peeps who feel similarly
[3:38:05] myahkaho: yes
[3:38:06] OhWin: That's cap
[3:38:06] Glenjii: yes
[3:38:07] stormlightcookie: exactly
[3:38:08] grizzlyhead: yes
[3:38:10] myyrlidon: but i feel bad if i do less dps
[3:38:11] gstn86: theres parsing in sod too so its kinda lame
[3:38:12] slapshotsd: @BlownFuse_ there's clearly a middle ground here though right
[3:38:17] thebruff: comp is most important
[3:38:19] Pirivan: If it’s possible to sweat in any game, a percentage of players will sweat.
[3:38:20] Chewii_OP: people check parses for bfd lol that raid was ridiculously easy and people still want exact meta of top raiding guilds
[3:38:21] Glenjii: I couldnt get Gnomer invites unless I was fire mage man :(
[3:38:23] drewbuckler: every pug wants 6/6 full pots and buffs for inv
[3:38:24] Goobadoobadoob: My guild only log checks to distribute people better in raid group so we all get a chance to finish the raid
[3:38:28] thebruff: some specs don't fit in comps
[3:38:37] Perdonamo: wow community/parsing so gatekeepy
[3:38:38] n0njaa: if you want to be competitive in pvp gear is important in classic for sure
[3:38:38] nakht__: I have a different experience - I play what I want and find people who don't care. Last night my joke-guild added 7 people because they liked our vibe
[3:38:38] Eggzactly54: it goes both ways too though sonii plays with lots of warriors and stuff. nobody is really left out
[3:38:39] nornh: @Glenjii thats why you join a guild of nice ppl my guy
[3:38:40] Reaperz_kinetic: reality is its classic wow with a twist nothing is THAT hard that you cant make any comp work
[3:38:45] Tovone: o7 󠀀
[3:38:45] Zonex2004: Tbh you can play any spec in the world. Being good increases your dps much more than talents
[3:38:46] BamboozlTV: specs are one thing, then there are certain runes you just can't go in without
[3:38:49] pizzadad212: you also know how to play the game though.. there are some very bad clsssic players (no offense)
[3:38:50] mellohh4444: Some of these people complaining classic expectations are too high havent wiped to people who are just really bad. I usually dont care about playing the BEST but I will advertise for pugs as if I do so I can filter out bad players
[3:38:51] Glenjii: @nornh it is hard to find one bro at least for me rn
[3:38:54] serilaz: DUDE alert the police ! somebody cut your hair!
[3:38:54] slapshotsd: unfortunately because it's 2024 people are going to run this game like retail, you need to find a community of people just ;like in retail if you want easy access to raids other high level content
[3:38:56] PooksPooksPooks: which mage wand you going for from tabatha
[3:39:03] tsetse2fly: @Loodimus try join a guild
[3:39:05] Tovone: EZ
[3:39:07] aBradAbroad: omgg that pushback is so frustrating
[3:39:10] avo_9: Retail is more difficult and people are just as bad at the game as they are in classic so peopel think you need to min-max to do heroic elvel content but the reality is most people aren't good enough to do it with any type of min-max.. sorry to be harsh
[3:39:11] pirateex: 2 days aago some people were gathering group for gnomergan and they wanted us to have 95% average in BFD and already crafted gear and world buffs :D

[3:39:39] legozoro: ahhh i was wondering thx
[3:39:40] TrueNosus: can you have both boon buffs in sod?
[3:39:40] Zevx: does SoD need preloaded rune setups that u can save like retail talents @Xaryu
[3:39:42] Zonex2004: Can we see what you look like without the headset for a sec
[3:39:42] fieryferal: Haircut, or did you just restyle?
[3:39:44] scivationx: I hate the min/max culture of gaming now a days. It's so toxic. I just want to play the way I want to play. I don't want to be told what build I need to be running or how I need to do my damage etc
[3:39:45] RedeemedbyJesus: Oh shoot, did you get a haircut!? Looks good broski!
[3:39:48] bubby6166: What veersion of WOW is this?
[3:39:53] TheTastyRamen: I just died 3 times in Booty by a rogue
[3:39:58] D_Tram: @Zevx no
[3:40:02] CubicleGangster: Man, this quest line sucks but the rune is so worth
[3:40:03] tdbeach1985: How is mage for pvp?
[3:40:04] bubby6166: Is this retail or classic?
[3:40:07] dougburnsplays: how many times do you respec a day?
[3:40:07] slapshotsd: people will normally be fine wiping in a friendly guild, pugs necessitate *decent* play at least but even then it's sod not mythic retail, you don't have to have a 99 parse to clear the raid
[3:40:09] tdbeach1985: I know spriest is currently insane
[3:40:24] nonomoino: @bubby6166 it is retail classic
[3:40:26] oJNelly: hair looks good, u should try a fade on the sides next time, with the top long still ofc
[3:40:27] Tovone: marked o7
[3:40:30] Doolie27: @tdbeach1985 It's good, ppl just like to say it's bad lol

[3:42:01] phenomzlol: KEKW
[3:42:04] kreumbly: One thing i do like that they added in classic is that you cant just camp someone repeatedly. They consider that harassment in classic but not retail.
[3:42:05] Shieldexx: @Xaryu AYO what happened to your hair chief? Looks good tho ngl xarW
[3:42:09] Elsevier86: Don't worry, when the time is right, he will find you

[3:43:09] iRayG2: wtf what is that?
[3:43:12] Reaperz_kinetic: not enough dps
[3:43:14] davepyo: Xar, did you ever use a player tracker addon? I had to back in the day to avoid rogues
[3:43:14] piperboi: you are face tanking

[4:42:06] brevder: unlucky brody, that was a 0.0000512 chance of happening
[4:42:11] Darnast: The probability of not getting a carrot on a single spell cast is 80% (100% - 20%). If you cast 10 spells in a row and each spell is independent of the others, then the probability of not getting a carrot in any single spell is 0.8.  The probability of not getting a carrot in any of the 10 spells is given by (0.8)^10 since each spell is independent.  So, the probability of not getting a carrot in all 10 spells is approximately 0.1074, or 10.74%.  Therefore, the chance of not getting a carrot in

[5:09:02] lion_the_ryan: "good"
[5:09:03] zerozuckerl: he thought it was no pet instead of no pot :)
[5:09:04] Eggzactly54: melee hunter are sick

[5:09:35] asloff: when are you gonna go out and discover the deepfreeze rune?
[5:09:35] Ervill1: how did the hunter stick to Xar 100% uptime? cant you nova + blink away?
[5:09:35] Zielepoot: Bestial wrath is a 40 point talent though
[5:09:38] waggle1122: @daijahaden the norm is no consumables otherwise dueling would be crazy expensive.. You could maybe argue that cash duels are different idk

[5:11:00] Yson24: ¸how are warlocks doing ?
[5:11:00] daijahaden: @waggle1122 yeah that's fair. I dunno. Cash duels aren't mak'goras, but they're not normal non risk duels neither. If there's a stake, there should be terms set. But I dunno
[5:11:01] bigwilly3737: its not balanced at all to many one shot mechanics
[5:11:04] Griddlecakes: way too much dmg and no stamina
[5:11:15] kinglzik: druuid has same struggle as mage, except less cc

[5:11:30] kaizen421: bad rogue

[5:12:13] richardat1: woah okay with the new hair lookin like a GQ model
[5:12:14] zkakashiz: hunter are only tough if you cant kite, they have zero chase or cc
[5:12:17] durtyburton: @lion_the_ryan ya warriors with healer are always decent due to being able to keep rage. but most classes with a healer are decent
[5:12:18] bigwilly3737: @fitethepower your watching a r1 mage thats played for 15 years+ mages arent busted hes just good
[5:12:19] pmanfit91: Most Boomies are in hiding, honestly. It'll be the same with Shadow Priest after tomorrow.
[5:12:22] J0yBoy20: NOOOOOO youur hair :(((((((((((
[5:12:26] ckeezwo: feral drood is good ?
[5:12:29] asloff: do you think the pvp scene will change when deep freeze gets discovered?
[5:12:29] rns_aurelius: @chillingdyylan no one will wear that set in pvp

[5:13:00] pein_iwnl: @StunningPaul its when the cc breaks on its own
[5:13:00] pmanfit91: @Gagax2990 We'll see tomorrow. No point in back and forth right now. It's getting the same exact treatment as Starsurge did.
[5:13:01] pursuit644: please bro what leveling spec for 25-40
[5:13:04] RaCks001: It drains all mana lol
[5:13:06] twobrat: i would like a trade, nerf surge, buff all frost runes
[5:13:08] incognito_enjoyer: It literally cost all your mana.... Why shouldn't it hit hard?
[5:13:27] Gagax2990: @pmanfit91 with huge dot buff, and wayyyy mopre utility/survivability/cc than druids
[5:13:31] ataturk1907: show talents pls

[5:13:35] realandtruephobe: Ziqo with surge :O
[5:13:35] lion_the_ryan: @incognito_enjoyer it should hit hard, it shouldn't be able to one shot someone
[5:13:37] bigwilly3737: it costs all your mana tho how does it need nerfed
[5:13:38] CubicleGangster: Mages gonna PoM + AB + AS their way to victory
[5:13:39] stormlightcookie: yes
[5:13:43] darkwingduck06: pally bubble?
[5:13:48] Sliek: bank a heal after poly
[5:13:58] pmanfit91: @Gagax2990 The biggest concern they have right now is SW:D damage. We don't know what everything else will look like because we haven't seen it yet.
[5:14:03] Spl1ker: chat , when is the tournament
[5:14:04] lion_the_ryan: @bigwilly3737 because if you can kill someone in one hit with it then who cares about the mana
[5:14:06] grizzlyhead: surely Clueless
[5:14:09] RaCks001: It doesnt

[5:15:17] pein_iwnl: @alphaRogueX nah ur a rogue, theres no point LUL
[5:15:17] incognito_enjoyer: @lion_the_ryan you're literally talking about needing an ability over just dueling alone... Arcane surge outside of duels is FINE... It literally cost all your mana
[5:15:21] hydRwa: @xaryu is the tourney too sweaty 4 u to compete?
[5:15:25] guni1980: Ahh, that is why Hydra and all the other EU streamers are playing NA

[5:15:59] kaizen421: @v_Ve guess
[5:16:01] Whitedotlol: @Xaryu - Hey Xaryu, hope all is well with you! I had a quick question. I see in your stream setup that you have a Camera and not a webcam. Does that mean you use the Camera as your webcam? If so, why?
[5:16:02] royas__: Sod
[5:16:04] lion_the_ryan: then they need to have different balances for abilities in pvp and in pve
[5:16:06] mzdgamer: do u play with sticky targeting?
[5:16:18] Erbsosa: he ffin
[5:16:19] lordlaesooor: where is your luscious hair?

[5:16:22] KarmaNation_: how do i get an invite to the tourney buddy
[5:16:22] danYEdig: whats sticky targeting?
[5:16:23] lesuperspooky: What server are you on?
[5:16:23] fyeefyee: was too busy looking at the duel to notice that hair cut 🤦‍♂️
[5:16:24] bawlsucka: What is the best pvp class do you think
[5:16:24] zerozuckerl: what is sticky targetting
[5:16:24] waggle1122: i like how this guy opted for a no gold duel because of cooldowns then used LoH
[5:16:26] anelko90: what is sticky targeting xD ?
[5:16:27] trump_tvx: talents?
[5:16:30] v_Ve: surge is a skill in sod? i thought it only came out with DF lol
[5:16:34] incognito_enjoyer: Nerfing arcane surge just because it's good in duels in dumb asf... Outside duels arcane surge is BLEH
[5:16:36] Knocktoff: will there be banned items/abilities or will it be like HC and anything goes
[5:16:39] SavageSeb_: You look 10 years younger now
[5:16:40] chasegapo: hair looks really good xare
[5:16:42] StunningPaul: What is heartbeat break? You say it on YouTube a lot

[5:16:55] bloodmoon201: Guys, which is better for fire spec, elemental precision for extra hit or combustion ?
[5:16:58] kloperx: is there any class you think is really broken OP rn? @Xaryu
[5:17:01] realandtruephobe: The less rules the better
[5:17:01] anelko90: kk
[5:17:02] galtorii: baywatch hair vibe
[5:17:03] darkwingduck06: magic dust
[5:17:08] realandtruephobe: thats what made OTK HC tourny so fun
[5:17:08] DWhite990: Wait what just happened wasn't hje dueling that other pally?
[5:17:09] lion_the_ryan: @incognito_enjoyer Well there you go, if no one uses it outside of duels because it's "bleh" then it's only being used to one shot in pvp
[5:17:10] cory_lockman: dampen magic?
[5:17:11] asloff: @incognito_enjoyer im pretty sure blizzard has never once tried to balance a spell/class based on "duels"
[5:17:13] rollinsthechamp: @Xaryu Pls dont invite Payo
[5:17:13] ScryerTV: when is it
[5:17:17] Knocktoff: it depends for sure
[5:17:19] cyphar007: what's wrong with arcane surge?
[5:17:19] bawlsucka: Holy bicep
[5:17:19] realandtruephobe: For sure, need some rules
[5:17:21] x__Renato: @anelko90 stickytargeting OFF is better in some context for pvp thats all
[5:17:23] kajzanx: cdl 2019 rules bis
[5:17:25] qteelmao: stop trying tin fluence him idiots
[5:17:25] zerozuckerl: @rollinsthechamp agreed lol
[5:17:40] Reaperz_kinetic: @rollinsthechamp why?
[5:17:50] CubicleGangster: Yeah...and with imp CS, they have a free 4 second opener on any class
[5:17:56] Kersed805: can you demo how good it is?
[5:17:58] stroobzbeats: mak gora tourneys are still the best - the most on the line
[5:18:02] waggle1122: is that another world buff
[5:18:04] lowlay0: i think it should be FFA since its SOD get creative Kappa
[5:18:05] Iol69: @Reaperz_kinetic hes a grown manchild lol
[5:18:15] bigwilly3737: ret pallys slap
[5:18:20] incognito_enjoyer: Why does he keep saying to nerf an ability because it's good in duels ? That's not how balancing a game works?
[5:18:26] bloodmoon201: Guys, which is better for fire spec, elemental precision for extra hit or combustion ?
[5:18:29] RaCks001: Win 3 duels in a row with arcane surge. Its not that good
[5:18:36] Reaperz_kinetic: @Iol69 and youre crying about him.... he can be in the toruney without you watching lol
[5:18:41] nixxor: I just got my epic helmet today :D
[5:18:42] arcane_p: was there a rule against soul link siphon life builds in the other tourneys when warlocks were op lol
[5:18:44] Glenjii: hardcore do be fun
[5:18:47] FlowersAnger: Hardcore is just actually the best way to play the game
[5:18:50] thejiggler1: Curious what buffs you think mages need if they nerf arcane?
[5:19:00] rollinsthechamp: @Reaperz_kinetic Too annoying these days, cries about everything, cant take a loss I could continue
[5:19:00] kaiser_rk: guys what addon show the spellpower ?
[5:19:02] bigwilly3737: @FlowersAnger facts it feels boring not playing it hc
[5:19:13] Abuskillz: @FlowersAnger agree
[5:19:14] Iol69: @Reaperz_kinetic i literally said one thing. lol
[5:19:15] asloff: @incognito_enjoyer crazy how some people just hear what they want to hear
[5:19:18] Reaperz_kinetic: @rollinsthechamp you really couldnt cause that only applies if you watch him... just dont watch
[5:19:19] inhaledthc: Can u explainhow the solo target heal works on mage im askimg for a mage friend
[5:19:19] throssome: hey Xar! just tuning in. love the new helm you get IRL
[5:19:21] Sandbox1993: dude the hair looks sick!
[5:19:23] lordlaesooor: do you switch gear when out of combat for diff runes?
[5:19:26] edvano: Bro silence
[5:19:28] mjd_22: havent gotten the epic quest yet, am i still able to farm a shadowy figure
[5:19:30] theelder1312: sp is more op
[5:19:31] incognito_enjoyer: At literally the cost of entire mana bar
[5:19:33] theelder1312: druid is more op
[5:19:34] edvano: blizzard is listening
[5:19:35] bloodmoon201: @Xaryu Which is better for fire spec, elemental precision for extra hit or combustion ?
[5:19:37] waggle1122: the design of the skill is just bad, they should remove
[5:19:37] FZanix: @kaiser_rk CharacterStatsClassic I believe
[5:19:38] marcusllee: will you set up the guild near feb 29th for those who want to play?
[5:19:39] ewweg: the pushback makes casting really bad
[5:19:42] bawlsucka: Johnny dep
[5:19:42] Zacrilioth: I think its BS our set reduces our hp so much... mages are already glass cannons
[5:19:43] durtyburton: have you dueled many ferals yet? or are most druids moonkinds?
[5:19:44] Abuskillz: hair irl KEKW
[5:19:45] FlowersAnger: Only reason everything isn't hc is that devs have to cater to the people that aren't serious enough for that experience, which is not a bad thing, but normal is like casual mode lol
[5:19:46] rollinsthechamp: @Reaperz_kinetic So Xar wouldnt react to the Clips about him crying? He wouldnt watch his Stream POV?
[5:19:47] incognito_enjoyer: Mage is useless outside of that one cast ...
[5:19:47] Bahood: so do a couple other spells on other classes. so those classes should also lose their 1 shot ability. boomkin, priest etc.
[5:19:51] cory_lockman: I wanna see enhance shammy get a charge
[5:19:53] CubicleGangster: And you regen 300$ + Mana Gem
[5:19:55] StripSniper: mages are really good at dueling, any group pvp is a little underpowered
[5:19:56] coneheadnor: rogue is kinda mid atm
[5:19:58] Playonwordz: 2 hours to get 100 mageweave lul
[5:20:00] Teokin: went over to shobek's stream to check out what the bankai crew is up to. He's struggling pretty hard as a rogue now it seems haha
[5:20:05] lhjnilsson: HAIR
[5:20:07] incognito_enjoyer: So nerfing an ability because it's good in duels is DUMB
[5:20:08] hakon123321: Show it
[5:20:09] batchestspam: plus u get 25% mana back after 8 seconds
[5:20:11] Aceydude: Druids in Hiding after Starsurge nerf
[5:20:13] realandtruephobe: I missed rogue duel, how did you avoid stun to death?
[5:20:15] aseoun: where has mitch been?
[5:20:16] Smoove3: is there a tier list for pvp specs rn
[5:20:18] Zacrilioth: Would you agree mages need some sort of damage reduction rune
[5:20:20] Reaperz_kinetic: @rollinsthechamp when hes casting no probably not...
[5:20:21] madmanmax1336: Which server are you running?
[5:20:25] lion_the_ryan: @inhaledthc you cast it for a 15s buff that you can release to heal
[5:20:26] shadowreath93: my feral 2 shots ppl with shred
[5:20:29] Eggzactly54: a good druid is still VERY good
[5:20:32] mobileorder: feral is starting to scale better
[5:20:32] revora_: Druids in STV still owning
[5:20:35] batchestspam: just surge and ice block back to 25% and finish them off it’s broken
[5:20:36] stillnick: are druids as op with starsurge as they were in phase 1?
[5:20:39] bigwilly3737: they buffed every class so much that rogues feel weak as hell rn
[5:20:40] twobrat: revora_ exactly
[5:20:40] TheKidCody16: feral druid so good
[5:20:41] rollinsthechamp: @Reaperz_kinetic Last tourny they were also checking POVs lol what are u talking about
[5:20:42] durtyburton: when you say druid you mean healer/boomkin, i dont think feral is relivant in pvp/pve
[5:20:45] hakon123321: Can you Arcane Surge in action? Since you say its so OP
[5:20:45] Astallos: Shaman/druid/priest/mage in fact every caster can one shot on a crit any other classes so yeah balancing is real bad in pvp right now.
[5:20:45] skydream_chl: the druid do craaaazy craaaaazy damage
[5:20:46] waggle1122: how bad can the nerf be? do they need to cast 3 spells to kill someone now?
[5:20:48] thoroej: what about rouges?
[5:20:51] GH0STtdi: how are shamans?
[5:20:51] kaiser_rk: @FZanix  thx mate
[5:20:51] bawlsucka: Take shadowstep off gcd
[5:20:56] FlowersAnger: If you're playing dueling tourney you should 100% have two toons ready because you never know which ones will get buffed and nerfed before the tourney
[5:20:56] asloff: that dude was trying a weird build XD
[5:21:02] shadowreath93: @mobileorder yeah every phase feral seems to get stronger i can imagine they will be super op next phase or phase 4
[5:21:12] inhaledthc: @lion_the_ryan  do u double press it or is it different spells
[5:21:13] Zielepoot: wrong client
[5:21:15] Zacrilioth: @Xaryu what if they made mana shield no longer consume mana but increase the cost of the spell and put it on a CD?
[5:21:15] bigwilly3737: do rank 1 frostbolt for proc
[5:21:15] criowa: I stop leveling my Druid (was alt toon) literally suck right now, lol
[5:21:19] grubols: it’s just like what else but missles are you using
[5:21:20] Bahood: arcane blast procs it so often its so nice
[5:21:23] zeqxylol: it has to be because its r1 fb
[5:21:25] Reaperz_kinetic: @rollinsthechamp wasnt all the time and half the time they did they were muted... also if you dont like it just... dont watch or mute it
[5:21:28] thoroej: @Xaryu what do u think of rouges ?

[5:22:23] Teokin: Shobek doesn't think so and he's A tier if not S tier classic rogue
[5:22:24] True_Sniper_: unless you're a healer and they kill you in .5 seconds
[5:22:24] tikjoe: There a druid

[5:22:43] Kroski: @OrganikCum People playing "x" class complaining that their class is weak, yeah nothing to see here
[5:22:43] Larewt: feral feels like it just flops over because they dont have a 1 shot like so many others do
[5:22:44] StreamElements: Catch stream highlights at -> https://youtube.com/@xaryu & https://youtube.com/@xaryuclips
[5:22:49] Reaperz_kinetic: @rollinsthechamp you realize payo is good at pvp too right? and payo is all their friends.... really the solution is you dont have to watch
[5:22:51] OrganikCum: hes a good boomkin, i dont care if he's likeable

[7:05:10] lepkebocs: enlighten is bis for arc now
[7:05:10] Necrosis1991: its good for aoe farming
[7:05:16] Gabe4D: lower cast time of Chrono, reduce healing, make frostbolt work like mind spike, 3 stacks increase crit chance of next icelance by 90%
[7:05:18] Death_Divine: What's the elite frame on nameplate?
[7:05:32] OhWin: Do you jam spirit then

[7:06:07] realandtruephobe: swim! lol
[7:06:21] SgtPepperTTV: Yeah but it's a dead rune for most of the time you aren't almost oom or almost full mana
[7:06:33] KnotlessKnot: thats something that will never be good until there is a breakpoint at which you can keep casting below 30% mana and not go oom, then its broken. hard to balance
[7:06:35] scoutbeans: leatrix plus lets you mute the mount sound if you don't like it, xar

[7:08:19] ogSaltdaddy: @Xaryu Are you going with 2 healers and you as arcane or 1 healer + you?
[7:08:20] espi: healing parses are raid damage parse lol
[7:08:24] ProjectSevan: Arcane can pump healing on certain fights
[7:08:29] nosebleedlol: why isnt their a hybrid parse
[7:08:33] desweck: yeah but it's still show the ability, i don't sweat healing parse
[7:08:33] VinnyVichie: you can use arcane surge to boost mana regen, they never run outta mana

[7:10:52] snowbeezy23: try no ice shards, put points into frost channeling
[7:10:53] tns_sensei: whats the confirmed best build?

[7:11:21] cjaniss3: but did you get a haircut - screw the build
[7:11:24] Mefi1988: why u do not go for fingers of frost?
[7:11:27] zeqxylol: Clap
[7:11:32] tns_sensei: runes for the build?
[7:11:32] divinekiwi: divinekiwi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[7:11:33] Mefi1988: 2x 50% krit chance
[7:11:35] Meggozz1: u just need to survive LUL
[7:11:42] jaymesze: Ive been loving fire mage in pvp at strangle and battlegrounds. alot of aoe with living bomb and blast wave
[7:11:43] SurrealAndre: FoF never procs when you want it
[7:11:57] grizzlyhead: Tell us about how u dont like how bad ice lance is right again LUL
[7:12:03] Saint_Vallion: thats fucked
[7:12:07] nosebleedlol: thats pee pee poo poo
[7:12:07] snowbeezy23: its been like that all of wotlk
[7:12:10] nosebleedlol: must be a bug
[7:12:13] KingChur: blizzard procs FoF
[7:12:14] Saint_Vallion: maybe they could fix that
[7:12:17] Badbotqt: resist on a 22 gray lol
[7:12:38] SurrealAndre: interesting
[7:12:49] zeqxylol: dont think this is intended
[7:12:50] Snohconez: like that on WOTLK servers
[7:12:52] snowbeezy23: its always been like that
[7:12:54] realandtruephobe: I wonder if blizzard knows
[7:12:55] vathx: has to be a bug
[7:12:58] grizzlyhead: Rune procs are just bugged af
[7:12:58] Mefi1988: but after the bite u can sheep and kill
[7:12:58] snowbeezy23: in classic atleast
[7:13:05] nosebleedlol: i would notice that instantly if i played mage
[7:13:10] Meggozz1: LUL LUL LUL
[7:13:11] nosebleedlol: how have they not fixed this bug
[7:13:14] peteschaff: i was using fingers of frost pre level 10, without frost bite
[7:13:36] kniteone: @Xaryu Can I see you solve your rubix cube? :)
[7:13:48] Badbotqt: that was like 4 arcane barage procs in 5 bolts
[7:13:49] Paramaum: is this a good thing or nah?
[7:14:08] nosebleedlol: it can still be good vs druids or stuff that can dispel your stuff before getting a combo off
[7:14:10] Sckarr1337: but you can save 3 pnts then since you'll get FoF
[7:14:14] snowbeezy23: xar points into frost channeling is very good also, no pts into shards. good for fishing and heal mana cost for your barrage/AB
[7:14:15] Zacrilioth: last season it was proccing from using blizzard
[7:14:22] foxwinkle: so if you dont put any talent in frostbite it will not proc?
[7:14:29] Sckarr1337: or save 3 pnts in frost bite
[7:14:30] Drivebypwned: doesnt proc off nova?
[7:14:31] peteschaff: but what about using it pre level 10, without frost nova, i swear i was getting procs with it KEKW
[7:14:37] grizzlyhead: no :)
[7:14:41] lexible: doesnt that also imply that fof is only a 5% proc chance rather than 15
[7:14:43] Mefi1988: fingers proc - sheep - acraneblast surge
[7:14:48] Zacrilioth: so it nerfs the proc to a 15% chance
[7:14:59] tns_sensei: so youre just spamming r1 frostbolt while pvping
[7:15:00] Zacrilioth: nvm
[7:15:10] lexible: what if you have only 1/3 in frostbite
[7:15:11] Seronem0: now when you put 1 into frostbite what happens?
[7:15:12] Sckarr1337: yeah, they shouldn't be the same 15%
[7:15:24] probeu: sounds giga bugged
[7:15:33] KnotlessKnot: yep
[7:15:35] Mefi1988: what happen when u dont skill frostbite
[7:15:39] Sckarr1337: very strange
[7:15:52] tense_bagel: so its both proc or neither?
[7:15:55] Paramaum: thats dumb af
[7:15:57] Nivekpro: FoF works without frostbite though
[7:16:02] ryuzakilightyagami: Blink
[7:16:02] morrisculpepper: sweet cut bro
