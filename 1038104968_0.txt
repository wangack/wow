[2:31:37] t3bryn: @holyxct Yes, but it struggles in very high keys (23+) because from there on paladin damage goes from very helpful to extremely helpful

[2:33:09] t3bryn: @holyxct Resto shaman also doesn't bring paladin damage, but has so much healing that it doesn't really matter (unless you want to push 25 keys, then it's just really hard without a holy paladin). Also, rest shaman has the highest healing of any healer

[3:16:23] nimeon01: jenux ye I said the same, Pado99 with the keystone level 5 insight LUL
[3:16:27] arcturio77: Frost could be for venthyr double gargoyle pulls? They did it on haikais and boss 3.
[3:16:38] swordart_19: Skyline NUMBA WAN
[3:16:41] TheDadBodGod: @chip9800 because she didn't sign up
[3:16:42] sarkOpharg: @maerulol You gotta clam down. They never said that frost is bad, it's just that fire is better in anything they would do in this competition outside of very specific things. e.g. tripple gargoyles
[3:16:45] nimeon01: You cant control two gargoyles.
[3:16:45] thenateo2: @CaptainRandom77 paladin plays venthyr
[3:16:52] gotelto: Where is Sjele Caster? :{
[3:16:57] thenateo2: you can
[3:16:58] zbbbof: actually 10 deaths are intentional
[3:17:01] Darkeitv: is skyline china team ?
[3:17:02] Papium: they don't need frost for double gargoyle pull
[3:17:02] Kashaww: Yes you can

[3:17:18] taylorette: holy pally op jeez
[3:17:21] LaddergoatFIN: you can do double controls with just 1 venthyr, frost is picked for shard funnel dmg afaik
[3:17:22] TheSemiDutch: we need full moon emote
[3:17:22] chip9800: @TXXSHI BECAUSE there no female in this teams
[3:17:24] yngx_: they focus
[3:17:32] Natuzzih: @nimeon01 u can if u spam the button
[3:17:35] lofibanshee: No one actually knows because JR doesn't talk @pans_pov
[3:17:39] maerulol: @Xyronic Why not discovering new meta and play what you actually enjoy?
[3:17:44] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: pump it CoolCat
[3:17:46] chip9800: @TXXSHI congratulations!!!
[3:17:57] nimeon01: blepc no you cannot. If someone else controls a gargoyle you have to wait for it to time out.
[3:18:02] stabzmcgeee: @maerulol thats not how metas work
[3:18:08] maerulol: @sarkOpharg yeah sure in that competition expect Halls, Fire is overall better because of bigger pulls and the removed AOE cap
[3:18:13] Funningway: !rules
[3:18:16] HioTTV: !CMDS

[3:18:34] CryseGames: Its called going Big Dicc
[3:18:34] blepc: everybody tells you that you can, but you still say you cannot KEKW
[3:18:39] Puepe: @maerulol there can't be "new meta", meta is using the BEST there, otherwise it's not meta, everything is viable
[3:18:40] pans_pov: @TheSeanGill i think fact that my message was deleted only proves she is a girl, prolly chooses to remain anonymous
[3:18:45] BizBichou: @ChocoboLord he does
[3:18:50] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: #allspecsmatter
[3:18:55] maerulol: @stabzmcgeee then why is a bear suddenly in a comp? they see that bear is good and it maybe becomes meta
[3:19:10] markz92: do they play Frost for the double venthyr ?
[3:19:12] lofibanshee: No it doesn't prove anything mate. @pans_pov
[3:19:12] restraintd: except feral
[3:19:15] ChocoboLord: @BizBichou is he streaming? would like to see someone not playing DH LUL
[3:19:17] TheSemiDutch: @ChocoboLord dorkibear (tank) yumytv (healer)
[3:19:17] TheDadBodGod: @stabzmcgeee because bears are unkillable gods that do high dam
[3:19:25] maerulol: @Ryalz thats true but bad mouthing some speccs like some casters do increase the t*xicity ingame. I got removed more often because i was ''frost'' and not fire
[3:19:30] BizBichou: @ChocoboLord yes. dorkibear on twitch
[3:19:37] snf_smitus: Echo has a bugged mini boss LUL
[3:19:43] lofibanshee: @ChocoboLord yes he's streaming
[3:19:45] TheSemiDutch: @ChocoboLord dorki is always playing bear
[3:19:48] maerulol: @Puepe and how do you know what is meta and what is not? you test it out and high lvl keys what performs better
[3:19:49] stabzmcgeee: @maerulol they play it because it is meta for those dungeons,,,,
[3:19:55] Jouricarver: i wouldnt say bears do high damage but defo hard to kill
[3:20:07] Bitterbarno: !format
[3:20:11] Funningway: something felt off to me for a moment. then i realised.... wow is streaming on twitch?!?! :D
[3:20:24] maerulol: @stabzmcgeee and still they have different speccs/classes accross the board rn
[3:20:25] stabzmcgeee: @maerulol but this isnt where you test it out,,, they test in trials etc
[3:20:25] TheDadBodGod: Bears do most damage of all the tanks behind prot paladins @Jouricarver
[3:20:26] Erect_Flamingo: Dorki probably the best bear in WoW atm.
[3:20:30] ilfordlane: !brac,et

[3:20:44] Traveler_103: its intersting, I like this better than mdi, thought it would be about the same but this is more fun for me for sure
[3:20:53] Ryalz: @Ryalz I get that point yeah, I play warlock the amount of time xyronic has meme on them didnt help but them saying something really doesnt add that much to community perception. actually seeing the keys does
[3:20:53] BizBichou: @Erect_Flamingo more like dorki definitely the best bear in wow atm
[3:20:56] maerulol: @stabzmcgeee and here they tested out frostmage and agreed to thats its actually better for this comp than fire
[3:20:57] Moobot: More information on player Gear / Talents / Build can be found on Raider.IO: http://rio.gg/greatpushleaderblz

[3:21:05] brutalburst: we do hate this for him @tettles
[3:21:13] naptownblack: @TheDadBodGod thats not true...   brewmaster does more than bear and so does VDH when you factor in the 5% magic buff
[3:21:13] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge
[3:21:19] Xyronic: to be fair, warlock has been out of the m+ meta for a long time
[3:21:28] Xyronic: most of my flame for fun though
[3:21:32] maerulol: @Ryalz It depends. people play while listening and if you listen and casters bad mouth a specc people adapt to it
[3:21:33] TheDadBodGod: @naptownblack no it doesnt
[3:21:36] Ryalz: @Xyronic why you betray us warlocks, maybe new Seed spam will be meta Kappa
[3:21:41] pepega_in_the_chat4: lock has never been M+ meta?
[3:21:42] Xyronic: spoiler: it wont
[3:21:45] lofibanshee: Heck warlocks slootRiot
[3:21:46] Xyronic: Kappa
[3:21:49] nimeon01: Xyronic confirmed toxic
[3:21:51] sarefx: @TheDadBodGod its mostly about survivability, DH can do more damage than bear but cant survive these high keys without kiting so in the end DH dmg is lower, thats why in MDI DH was meta because he was able to handle big pulls on lower keys
[3:21:58] Karenius: it'd be nice to not see mage in m+ for a long time :) but you know that's not gonna happen
[3:22:00] femtv: I mean the short stint of Demo being OP around jaina, warlock was VERY strong
[3:22:00] lofibanshee: It was in Legion @pepega_in_the_chat4
[3:22:00] bromens: legion locks were good
[3:22:10] Cae_Missa: of course warlocks was meta in legion xDDD
[3:22:10] femtv: Other than that it's been legion
[3:22:15] Drachenfels: demonology is on the come up, i will not elaborate
[3:22:20] speedy__ttv: @sarefx couldnt have 2 druids on the mdi

[3:22:44] sesh_dg: yo chat does 2 chest just mean to +2 a key?
[3:22:49] Cae_Missa: @stardrift definatelly
[3:22:50] TheDadBodGod: @sarefx DH does not do more damage than bear, it just provides a magic buff for the DPS. They themselves do not out dps a bear
[3:22:55] Celenoss: !casters

[3:23:00] nimeon01: stardrift except survival hunters they were the worst spec ever made in legion LUL
[3:23:09] pepega_in_the_chat4: @TheSeanGill oooo i quit legion from 7.1- 7.3 after getting the wrong Random legendary 3x in a row
[3:23:15] Scaparino: dorkiYEP
[3:23:24] sesh_dg: @zurgin01 ty LUL
[3:23:33] nimeon01: Xyronic with blizzard balance methods NO LUL
[3:23:38] naptownblack: @TheDadBodGod so if a tank makes the dps do 150% more damage, you dont attribute that damage to the tank? what are you talking about
[3:23:40] JosephRoman921: what is this? like mdi?
[3:23:49] tapzww: @sesh_dg yes.. it's leftover terminology from legion when you got multiple loot chests for +1 +2 +3'ing the key
[3:23:49] maerulol: tbh i prefer non meta races much more than typical meta races like rn. Boomkin, friemage, holypaladin
[3:23:51] Dotctori: @sesh_dg Yes, you used to get multiple chests based on your performance and the saying sticked around
[3:23:54] MakzzTV: if a team starts a key and the 5 hours run out before they finish, are they allowed to  finish the run
[3:23:58] restraintd: legion m+ rewarded multiple reward chests along with the additional key levels
[3:24:09] pepega_in_the_chat4: after I got the wrong random legendary for the 3rd time in a row I punched my monitor so hard I broke my monitor LUL
[3:24:09] Geekop_: @MakzzTV Yes
[3:24:14] speedy__ttv: @naptownblack thats called being a support
[3:24:16] riemannfunction: YEP
[3:24:18] xmonk7: Are they allowed to practice after the 5 hours?
[3:24:21] Shaw: @MakzzTV from what ive heard, yes
[3:24:25] swordart_19: DOES TH BEAR STREAM ?
[3:24:27] nodwongo: Does the bear stream?

[3:44:47] TrippyvV: 25 tyran halls, this is what we're here for LUL
[3:44:48] swordart_19: SHEEESH
[3:44:55] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: buddy
[3:44:56] HolySamole: I believe blizzards deal with youtube specifically states MDI and AWC and this is neither so they arent bound by contract to not stream on twitch
[3:44:59] 2twofaced: nmpMelane
[3:44:59] TrippyvV: Sheeesh
[3:45:00] swordart_19: @ProfessorWC no can watch on youtube too
[3:45:04] NateYoungTV: @m0lybdenum42 believe they have to push it higher but key level doesn't decay if they fail
[3:45:07] Zambrossini: @Krigsgurun no, it is about how high they can get, the higher+ the more points they get
[3:45:13] Kuroz: wildigPog sheeesh
[3:45:17] Kabior: Sheeeeeeesh
[3:45:24] fissaa_: Noooooooooooo, PF is 25 max, marque my words
[3:45:26] Hiiirrooo: Would love to know what these perfectly competent other games where class design is perfect
[3:45:29] Sumirina: @m0lybdenum42 I think they start with all 6 keys on 24 and have to play them up (can't deplete tho)
[3:45:34] Elkethus: Hall tyranical on +25 is so easy Kappa
[3:45:38] lDABULOS3: crinje chat
[3:45:43] Krigsgurun: @zambrossini  ah alright, and they end when they happy or?
[3:45:51] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: What a coincidence! my m+ group kills itself on the first half too MiniK
[3:45:53] whhitee: @fissaa_ echo did 30 +2
[3:46:05] Schrei205: @m0lybdenum42 they upgrade the keys following standard rules for keys, so if they +2 on a 24, they can go straight into a 26. if they +1, they have to play the 25
[3:46:08] Hyozendriyu: Never see echo
[3:46:18] kitadev: @Sumirina they can deplete is they struggle. like they get +2 but wanna come down a notch
[3:46:20] Elkethus: @whhitee echo and ambitious are pretty godly lol
[3:46:20] TrippyvV: does that +30 pf +2 matter after the fix?
[3:46:20] Hiiirrooo: Please tell what these other competently designed games are idabulos3
[3:46:23] Leninay: yes but you can't do plagueborer strat with bolstering
[3:46:24] Sumirina: @Krigsgurun  they have 3 days, 5 hours on each day and try to get everything the highest
[3:46:27] swordart_19: @stupid_sexy_snail LUL
[3:46:29] fissaa_: @whhitee tyrannical bosses are thic, and bomb adds dont do that much damage
[3:46:37] BAKERGINGER: how can anyone in their right mind watch this without being instantly blind
[3:46:44] DDenathor: 25 pf is def not the max lol
[3:46:53] fissaa_: no way PF last boss falls on 26 tyrannical
[3:46:53] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge

[3:47:00] WillItbe: when are we going to add a twitch chat choses the mythic affixes challenge
[3:47:04] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: @HANSOL4PRESIDENT Blizzard loves spell clutter. the less you can see, the more fun !
[3:47:07] TrippyvV: im pretty sure they will find new stuff to cheese on PF
[3:47:11] bosse_brun: Wrong, petko timed 26 spires yesterday
[3:47:15] kitadev: @DDenathor I think it's because it's tyrannical that hey are saying that
[3:47:15] Leninay: yeah I would like to know too
[3:47:16] tettles: but it's only 15 hours, idk

[3:48:45] UltraSpinach: forsenE forsenE forsenE
[3:48:53] 324bee21: I certainly hope they move money into this from MDI next season
[3:48:53] lDABULOS3: lore haHAA,

[3:48:56] Gibs0n_: !gear

[3:49:00] paracent13: !result
[3:49:06] Leninay: the issue with MDI format is, that most games are decided once one team has a catatrophic wipe
[3:49:13] woocal: why is TGP better?
[3:49:13] TrippyvV: whats the principal on practice? does the TR shut down after the broadcast is done or
[3:49:14] 324bee21: !result
[3:49:15] Elkethus: I honestly like both mdi and this. Both ARE cool to watch and different but im gonna admit this tournament is great so far
[3:49:21] hotchonky: It‚Äôs cool but I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening very well. There‚Äôs a lot on the screen
[3:49:26] abra_casstabra: why are they keeping that add alive in HoA first boss
[3:49:29] Cachimala: Can plz someone explain me somthing about the 26/27 stat the casters are talking?
[3:49:33] TheDadBodGod: @woocal more like live keys = more relatable
[3:49:37] Symfonyyy: @tettles say hi
[3:49:43] 324bee21: Probably to avoid Pride?
[3:49:44] tettles: hi
[3:49:50] fissaa_: @speedtaco what, you dont have 4 screens?????
[3:49:50] Leninay: @speedtaco you can also watch the indivdual teams in their respective streams
[3:49:50] lDABULOS3: @fearofcode noone has any idea how to do that, life is just trying till we die
[3:49:51] UltraSpinach: I think those random sounds are not good :o
[3:49:54] Symfonyyy: hi
[3:49:55] TheDadBodGod: @Cachimala key lvvl
[3:49:57] MistyCooky: Pog he did it
[3:49:57] Puepe: @RookJackson % to skip the pride after the boss
[3:49:58] FugitiveMind_: they started on which difficulty?
[3:49:58] Shacalicious_: @tettles now say no
[3:50:01] tettles: no
[3:50:03] Traveler_103: like I dont even understand what could be wrong with what I write to be against moderation settings
[3:50:03] thratzr: @Cachimala they are talking about keystone levels
[3:50:03] hiddentiger44: @tettles helo
[3:50:06] kotakekw: 15 kekw
[3:50:10] Henry_Ash: what caster was just talking about doing 15s???
[3:50:16] Shacalicious_: this is why Tettles is bis <3
[3:50:19] tettles: @TXXSHI :)
[3:50:34] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: haHAA  = blizzard devs who worked on pride mechanics for months only to watch the top players skip it entirely.
[3:50:36] Cachimala: @thratzr Thank you so much
[3:50:37] rekujigaming: Do the teams get to choose the dungeons or is it random?
[3:50:50] Melthazor: thats a frost mage
[3:51:00] michaelbluth: hey @tettles , I thought your hair riveled zaelia's for awesomeness.  you're welcome.

[3:51:07] UltraSpinach: Dungeon Master jysSixtynine

[3:51:20] Elkethus: @rekujigaming i think is ramdom and they have to time it but i could be wrong
[3:51:24] itaymesa: @TXXSHI tom is so mad rn
[3:51:24] Traveler_103: @rekujigaming 6 of them

[3:51:30] consmallthumbs: ?
[3:51:40] Healingstat: lol
[3:51:42] Vanillabearz: why do they skip the prides?
[3:51:47] Diddeman1: its not tettles KEKW
[3:51:50] Traveler_103: @Elkethus not random, they choose the order though
[3:51:52] tettles: that is Doa
[3:52:04] razor1n: @climatechange_ it's faster to skip than kill
[3:52:04] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel ‚ÄúAutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Erik ‚ÄúDoA‚Äù Lonnquist, Tristan ‚ÄúDratnos‚Äù Killeen, Caroline ‚ÄúNaguura‚Äù Forer, Joseph ‚ÄúPsy‚Äù Prendergast, Peyton ‚ÄúTettles‚Äù Tettleton, and Alex ‚ÄúXyronic‚Äù Tatge
[3:52:09] felweedxo: are the *** links showing the teams/gear yet? also seeing lots of holy pally/bear/vengeance. any prot pally perspective in this push competition?
[3:52:09] Diddeman1: tft caster Pog
[3:52:10] Gizurrr: Yeah just someone said tettles
[3:52:11] Leninay: @climatechange_ because they have too much hp and do too much dmg for the dmg amp buff they give
[3:52:12] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: @climatechange_ #gamebalance
[3:52:13] Elkethus: @traveler_103 ah that make sense
[3:52:14] kitadev: @Elkethus you're wrong. They can choose any of the 6 dungeons. Affixes are fixed
[3:52:16] TheDadBodGod: @climatechange_ saves time
[3:52:17] techguy91: @climatechange_ take too much effort for what they get back.
[3:52:17] sLr_____: @climatechange_ way t much dmg, some unkillable wihtout cd's
[3:52:17] Pofferd: poah Doa, I missed that voice
[3:52:20] JKMGR33N: has echo timed the dungeon they're doing now?
[3:52:28] ArrgTV: @climatechange_ not worth killing... they take to long to kill on high keys + you need to commit to many CDs
[3:52:28] hotchonky: @stupid_sexy_snail i think the difficulty of pride outscales the rest of the dungeon eventually, so they skip because they have to
[3:52:29] marsbar_tv: dorkiSad protect the bear
[3:52:39] itaymesa: @felweedxo prot pala lul
[3:52:40] bjornebekk: Starcraft DoA Pog
[3:52:45] SeathVII: fragnance can play anything and do 26 its crazy
[3:52:45] NateYoungTV: @felweedxo prot pally is too squishy to go this high, they traded off survivability hard for big dps
[3:52:48] Vanillabearz: Thanks to all boizzzz
[3:52:50] rekujigaming: interesting. if they can "choose" their next dungeon, why not just go for the ones they havent done so they can rack up more points?
[3:52:58] UltraSpinach: "+25 TOP - Weekly, no leavers" cyriltLUL cyriltLUL
[3:52:59] TrippyvV: Necro dh Pog
[3:53:01] Lifebregin: @felweedxo I have bad news about Prot pally in push content
[3:53:10] Leninay: because the points only matter in the end
[3:53:12] Thoreya: Bc they can fail and waste time ^
[3:53:20] isadrienduil: sure Kappa
[3:53:24] cezar55555: prot warrior is dead üò≠
[3:53:27] Leninay: a lot of team prefer doing the same dungeon repeatedly to keep the focus

[3:53:30] davy_: wildigPog wildigPog wildigPog SHEEESH
[3:53:30] Traveler_103: @rekujigaming they need to do them all anyway, doesnt matter

[3:53:31] kitadev: @rekujigaming different strats
[3:53:32] Drezitu: @rekujigaming 3 days cup
[3:53:36] gilbertron: dorkiSad
[3:53:37] Symfonyyy: @rekujigaming they still have time. knock out the easy affixes now then theory craft the others
[3:53:37] elisadel: @rekujigaming it can be easier to push higher on a dungeon when you've warmed up on it
[3:53:43] Drezitu: Don't need to rush for points right now
[3:53:47] UltraSpinach: Because we need you need to finish 10 per week, and if you're not a full time wow player, it's getting hard sometimes.
[3:53:53] ArrgTV: @rekujigaming because usually its easier to do the same dungeon again, because they are in the mindset etc
[3:54:00] Sumirina: that's tripple stoneborn with 2 venthyr right?
[3:54:00] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: @speedtaco yeah im fine with the purpose, just think its funny that the main mechanic of m+ is skipped.
[3:54:04] Elkethus: yeah the thing is far from over still going for 3 days
[3:54:09] Healingstat: chowoffmeta

[3:56:21] UltraSpinach: @UltraSpinach I am never lucky with RNG (BlessRNG). That's why I need to run 10 per week. I still cannot roll shoulders which I 've got from first weeks of expansion. (I quit mythic raiding for now )
[3:56:22] Dramexx: yeq

[4:27:25] 0mmurg: shouldnt that be opposite
[4:27:37] UltraSpinach: @UltraSpinach I've watched some film a month ago and there was that phrase. Your nickname reminded me that
[4:27:40] elisadel: @Najjic Basically. They have a fixed amount of total time that they're allowed to run keys each day, so any time they spend resetting is time they lose from spending on other things, so it's a strategic choice
[4:27:40] WaxBalloon: asmongold is a gladiator and a keystone master, def an elite player

[4:28:39] die4weasel: @pakshee this is actually really enjoyable to watch
[4:28:41] MightyGIGACHAD: @vision2111 because ambition just reset so timewise they're behind. Neither team is winning overall
[4:28:56] kitchenapple: Blizz do more TGP please
[4:29:05] Mr_Ebrithil: @vision2111 They were about to time a 26 ToP 20 minutes ago, now they kinda lost some advantage since they reset

[4:31:07] razor1n: @artharys27 casters rotate, currently xyronic, DoA, and Jak
[4:31:10] vision2111: @Mr_Ebrithil theoretically mists is a faster key, so it depends who is gonna finish it in the end

[4:56:44] UltraSpinach: @bozzymodo LULE, I opened it on my phone (iphone 11), and it's really hard to watch
[4:56:46] emnitthy: F&f is such a horrible franchise
[4:56:47] jhon_wei: I think bear doesnt know that they can start a dungeon 5min before time runs out, hopefully someone let them know

[4:59:36] lilchica4: I see Echo <3 My alltime fave bois
[4:59:37] emnitthy: @jg120 and echo has half of their points so far, wasting lots of time on wiping 26s
[4:59:48] UltraSpinach: @JG120 it seems they want to rush low keys, but skyline wants to win with quality and value
[4:59:53] NOHITJEROME: if a run fails do they get any points for it or 0?
[4:59:56] jzen101: Do they have 3 days for all these dungeons? or are there more rounds?
[5:00:08] swordart_19: SKYLINE AGAIN F
[5:00:08] emnitthy: Calling 24s low keys is ridiculous
[5:00:13] JG120: @emnitthy i mean he was talking about skyline which has been doing better keys than bear? not sure what youre saying
[5:00:17] pryce_x: 3 days for all dungeons
[5:00:18] NateYoungTV: @NOHITJEROME they just restart the key, key level doesn't decay
[5:00:19] TheSemiDutch: @Johannes__ 15 hrs of playtime divided in 3 days
[5:00:20] RavenmourneTM: @NOHITJEROME they usually reset it themselves to retry it
[5:00:36] NOHITJEROME: @RavenmourneTM ohhh thanks :D @NateYoungTV ok that makes more sense
[5:00:38] Xyronic: bikeDogPic1
[5:00:39] gilloch: @Johannes__ they have 3 days to accomplish their highest keys.. all days are taken together
[5:00:44] Qcto: thats how qualify sessions in f1 work, you gotta start your lap before the timer runs out
[5:00:45] jzen101: aaah ty everyone
[5:00:53] emnitthy: Today honestly matters nill, day 3 is going to be probably the final push for the last couple of points
[5:00:54] Ramoneko: no timed keys doesnt count
[5:00:56] JG120: @UltraSpinach yeah interesting idea going for all 25s from bear wonder what placing it will get them
[5:00:56] NOHITJEROME: 24 is crazy hard, i watch a lot of keys on streams and i dont think ive seen a successful 24

[5:02:34] emnitthy: Less then an hour
[5:02:34] UltraSpinach: @JG120 I think skyline's strategy is more wise. When other teams finish lower keys they would face the highest ones, while skyline has already spent time on tries and will push 27s  or whatever
[5:02:41] speedy__ttv: @valar_mandus there was no tilting, just a clip taken out of context
[5:02:42] Tekniqz: cheers thanks Shaw
[5:02:45] snarky_presence: 34 minutes to start their last key
[5:02:47] Shaw: but if theyre already in a dungeon when time runs out they are allowed to finish it

[5:05:04] UltraSpinach: Warlocks - also banned word or what?
[5:05:07] jhon_wei: @Elysianlight probably because if you do 24 than 25 right after you have the route fresh in your mind and just need to execute
[5:05:08] doubleshinetv: @Elysianlight Probably if you just ran a 24, you're warmed up for 25
[5:05:10] TheSemiDutch: @juliuscaesar2860 atm no
[5:05:13] WaxBalloon: echo wiped again rip
[5:05:16] Lonely_TTV: @Elysianlight because points dont matter before the end, and playing a dungeon back to back is much better for consistency
[5:05:22] NOHITJEROME: What's the most active class when pushing keys? APM wise
[5:05:24] doubleshinetv: It's a marathon, not a sprint. Getting 150 today kinda means nothing

[5:06:47] doubleshinetv: Hpal apm is pretty high yeah
[5:06:47] NOHITJEROME: @NateYoungTV right i forgot about fury war, crazy active in retail :D
[5:06:49] Kgerie: isn't the main reason that frost mage is venthyr thus can control bats?
[5:06:49] Lythi: @NOHITJEROME just play a healer, then you¬¥re way to worried about everyone dying instead of trying to get the right APM LUL
[5:06:52] Jarlan23: junkrat isnt a firemage hes more of a tinker/engineer class

[5:40:28] RavenmourneTM: @floecklii they can continue if they want after a wipe but a wipe pretty much means dead key

[5:44:24] Patrikhg: they where like 10 seconds over today with 4 deaths echo
[5:44:24] lebnnnn: cant wait for the rivers of tears of boomkin mains about their changes next patch
[5:44:25] Amaumau: Yeah we have seen 8 classes out of 12
[5:44:27] nekromancer7: MDI feels a lot more scripted (which is impressive) but just seems very different from normal live play stlye
[5:44:33] swordart_19: @kaajuka yes

[5:44:47] Insidieux: @kaajuka yes they have the option to lower keys for better time etc.
[5:44:57] doubleshinetv: The only lack of diversity is Healer tbh and that's just hpal doing way more dam
[5:45:05] mynameisgoki: mdi is irrelevant for live servers
[5:45:08] LaddergoatFIN: @Lotusol skyline has a few players streaming on douyu
[5:45:08] darkrosslol: huh wonder what the meta is OMEGALUL
[5:45:09] burgundyGG: my boi dorki CoolCat

[5:45:33] Amaumau: Btw why has there been delay on the stream ?
[5:45:39] Magymaster: par will be like 150

[5:46:10] Jazzhandz: boring meta classes yay :D
[5:46:19] mynameisgoki: i mean who does speed runs of 18+ keys on live servere lol, so out of touch for the players
[5:46:34] killermix: they have to plan for 6dungeons instead of 4 i think its much better for the teams that finished 2 26s already
[5:46:35] Psybear_tv: @Beyzi oh fantastic day. I've got A LOT to say tomorrow
[5:46:44] Belirs: you should get bonus points for clearing them with survival hunter in your group :D
[5:46:44] doubleshinetv: @mynameisgoki in general no one speed runs keys
[5:46:45] Amaumau: I hope they get rid of delay tomorrow ^^
[5:46:49] shhhhyouareablessing: Check Echo!!!
[5:46:56] lebnnnn: balance druid no skill class
[5:46:56] Magymaster: @dadyicandy none, just the key level
[5:47:03] razor1n: @Amaumau little bit of delay is unavoidable for restreaming, also helps avoid technical issues
[5:47:04] AutomaticJak: Just used for tie breakers at the end @dadyicandy it lets a team skip running a 25 tho so its a big time save
[5:47:14] caelixxtv: @lebennnnnn haHAA

[5:47:54] Amaumau: @razor1n they are not restreaming, they get their footage from admins inside their group so theoretically there shouldn't be more than on the players stream
[5:47:54] Bliindmonk: @razor1n it cant be restream? they have completly diffrent Ui's?
[5:47:58] glemmstengal: did tettles say a gamer word? give me the scoop

[5:59:11] mikkeal0: @zhushma a 2 chest just saves time, because they skip the 25 run to a 26 run
[5:59:15] Traveler_103: 25 but you can skip to 26 next run
[5:59:17] RavenmourneTM: @zhushma +2 doesnt matter on points only allows them to skip a level

[5:59:24] consmallthumbs: but 2 chest 24 saves you loads of time because you skip having to run the 25
[5:59:24] TheSemiDutch: @zhushma 25. but 24+2 alows them to go straight to 26 so thats better time wise
[5:59:32] nothanksimfine: I hope they keep this format going forward. So much more fun to watch than the MDI format
[5:59:32] sLr_____: @zhushma the value of a 2 chest 24 is that you can go straight to 26
