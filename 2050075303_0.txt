[0:17:30] marbared: The important thing to remember (as hard as it is) is that others getting the legendary doesn't have a negative affect on your changes. Gotta celebrate even when the healadin gets one :)
[0:17:44] kynlaeh: hi hazel. partner just got out of surgery and everything went great! stress free finally
[0:17:49] Aseopp: I refuse to chase the legendary on my main. I gave it plenty of tries, but I know from watching this stream that sometimes it just does not happen.
[0:18:06] jgbrit: Hi Hazel hazelWave I've been thinking about the skull patch. I wonder if it's a huge world overhaul like cata 2.0. Zovaal said something about what is to come for our doomed world
[0:18:15] Rendwee: It was part of the war within announcement stuff, but they announced a lot of stuff so easy to forget
[0:18:28] Rendwee: Also who knows what they'll walk back on so who knows if it'll actually happen..
[0:18:50] Aseopp: oof

[0:38:36] tusktooth_matt: Hey Hazel! My wife and I took a long break from WoW due to a couple of kids being born and we’re now looking to jump back in. Would you recommend waiting until the next expansion, or is it easy to get back in after Dragonflight being out for a while?
[0:39:45] finalflight1: Do you think that the content in wow reatil has become feminine? I say that because of the ending  cut scenes and new mount designs.
[0:39:50] Kurama__95: If you missed most of DF, S4 is the best time to come back, as you can experience all of the raids and dungeons as main progression paths at once
[0:39:53] tusktooth_matt: Amazing thanks so much! Yeah just want to enjoy the content. Nothing too intense :D

[0:52:43] cashthb: do you think you'll jsut start to kill the dude at the bridge before you get the mount?
[0:53:02] wolfcloudchaser80: I suspect it just picks male/female at random, my male gnome became a female human mannequin
[0:53:24] macydoes_: i can smell that this run will be it!
[0:53:25] Atomicpanda: wish i could grow my own pepperoni in a pot by the window.

[1:26:14] Neltalie: very cute :D
[1:26:20] StraightErro: the pink cloth shoulders instead of the spiky gold ones?
[1:26:21] Perkolate: he actually looks pretty good haha
[1:26:23] anker_jym: Santa, what have they done to you D:
[1:26:29] cashthb: 'member when barnaclus was just some old dood that only liked nothing but fishing?
[1:26:31] Octopixy1971: thats a big love witch haha
[1:26:48] Atomicpanda: hot
[1:26:48] goplacidly56: lol
[1:26:52] Neltalie: the weapon doesnt match that much though does it?
[1:26:56] Octopixy1971: hazelTen hazelTen hazelTen
[1:27:12] Habituron: if it looks ok on the female draenei, it probably will look good on female tauren - they're almost the same shape
[1:27:14] Kubwa7: i love this month so much...watching different streamers be as goofy as possible is a gem
[1:27:22] Stoicgamingx: Moon Prism Power!
[1:27:30] GreenArrowed: branabus looks great in everytrhing
[1:27:43] cupcakechaos013: well now i want to make a sailor moon mage hahaha
[1:27:45] Hulkhokie: Barnaclus has been defiled
[1:28:02] databob1: thats amazing
[1:28:18] muffin1609: what did i tab back into
[1:28:22] chops6965: what set was that on your hunter?
[1:28:54] msmester1: bow with a tail LUL
[1:29:01] Malfleur: Hode Head and feet
[1:29:03] samxox: plus they dont have feet to show the ugly booties
[1:29:25] cashthb: also it doesn't changes their legs, bet yet again I think petalbloom could rock that set too
[1:29:47] chops6965: ah ok, thanks!
[1:30:19] Draconyne: My anti-valentine hunter is looking good now
[1:34:38] Rendwee: not allowed to sit there anymore
[1:34:42] Rendwee: just gotta stream standing
[1:34:49] Kurama__95: There's an entry on the Traveler's Log that requires us to kill a MoP raid bosses during Timewalking week. New Timewalking raid inc? :O
[1:35:02] jack_fraust: Hi Hazel!!!! my cat does the exact same thing lol
[1:35:04] Ryok: omg blizzard just added a toy that transforms you into a murloc to the shop PogChamp finally my dream of murloc DH comes true
[1:35:05] msmester1: the cat was streaming wtf
[1:35:29] Rendwee: There are quite a few that are just themed as "do stuff in that expansion areas" rather than specifically current content in those locations
[1:35:34] Zacewing: I wonder if they've just stopped doing TW raids cause so few people do them
[1:35:34] cashthb: they should do timewalking terrace! I love heal checks
[1:35:47] Perkolate: oh boi new shop stuff
[1:36:02] jack_fraust: it got so bad i bought the dude his own gaming chair and still!!!!
[1:36:06] jack_fraust: lol
[1:36:14] itsparvati: kitty just wants to help mama with game. so sweet
[1:36:14] Mistyshade79: at what level can you do timewalking?
[1:36:14] cashthb: D: banned
[1:36:21] Zacewing: they haven't added a new TW raid since firelands which was back in...BfA wasn't it?
[1:36:38] msmester1: i want to buy and the disconnect LUL
[1:36:47] anker_jym: Have you considered doing Solo Shuffle stuff on your Holy Priest since you're done with raids, or do you just enjoy PvP Resto Druid too much?
[1:37:07] Octopixy1971: They also got a twilight pack on the shop
[1:37:16] Octopixy1971: mount and mog
[1:37:25] jack_fraust: I have to say thank you, I have foundd your video's of walk through's sooo amazing its how I discovered you
[1:37:33] Octopixy1971: twilight witch lol
[1:37:48] Cooperharley0204: what made you want to heal originally over dps?
[1:37:53] Cooperharley0204: or tank?
[1:38:04] anker_jym: That's a fair point. PvP is a whole different game almost
[1:38:28] cashthb: you can't learn pvp without doing it
[1:38:44] itsparvati: shadow hazel go brrrr
[1:38:49] jack_fraust: look at you now!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:39:02] ntdrongo: back in classic with the old talent trees
[1:39:06] Rendwee: One of our raid healers switched to DPS this season and the 3 healers that joined our guild all quit so she's stuck healing again
[1:39:11] sanguinette: My son likes to heal because then he's only competing against himself
[1:39:11] msmester1: i have no idea how or why did i choose my class
[1:39:49] Rendwee: Definitely easier on classes that have similar stat priorities
[1:39:58] Zacewing: my problem is that I like healing and DPSing but never on the same class xD
[1:40:01] itsparvati: i can heal and dps, just not on the same toon which RLs no like
[1:40:13] msmester1: as a pure dps class player i dont have an opion LUL
[1:40:13] R1_Prototype: every girl I know that plays. plays a healer a tank or a hunter. my wife included.
[1:40:27] anker_jym: For me, my dad created my first character years and years ago, so that's how my decision was made lol. But thankfully, I've loved Warlock ever since.
[1:40:34] Rendwee: I play a feral druid only forever :)
[1:40:40] mrspawkats: @El_Capitan_Live i play mage
[1:40:47] jessetenfour: very true, the girl's i know are all either healers or hunters too lol
[1:40:50] Rendwee: There's definitely a bias where people try to make women play healers
[1:40:55] mindflayerMinis: What are we farming for?
[1:41:01] Mrs_Muffyn: I started healing because the dps-meters stressed me so much in raids. And I absolutely love love love healing <3
[1:41:04] Briibuns: i play mage and druid mostly
[1:41:38] itsparvati: when it comes to the raid heal teams, straight men are a minority for sure
[1:41:51] kalinaah: it just doesnt feel nice to hear "Oh you play that because you're a girl" (saying this as a girl that has heard it many times before)
[1:42:08] GreenArrowed: i play warlock, shaman and pally, never heal on the last 2. too anxious to heal.
[1:42:09] msmester1: i only play healer in sod but priest is so op i almost fall asleep LUL
[1:42:16] pinkpaws_: but being a healer in like mythic is the hardest role tho
[1:42:20] Gurottesquex: That is exactly how I got back into playing wow lol
[1:42:27] itsparvati: i got into games from ex-bf bugging me to. then he hated playing with me because i was so much better
[1:42:43] Gurottesquex: Stopped in MOP b/c my guild found out I was a girl and didnt like it and now I'm back in a much better spot with much better people.
[1:42:48] mrspawkats: @itsparvati LUL
[1:42:54] jack_fraust: Hazel I have a challenge for you!
[1:43:17] databob1: my wife likes dps pally alot
[1:43:21] jm9600: I stopped playing healer and switched to dps because I was tired of being blamed when a tank over pulled.
[1:43:30] mindflayerMinis: Hazel are we rocking one of those sweet  over the top truck stop animal T shirts !?
[1:43:34] AmiYuy: Me too for games in general! High school boyfriend and friends
[1:43:35] itsparvati: it wasnt that i was so good, its just he was REALLY BAD
[1:43:37] sence_00: the "girls play heals" sterotype is damaging to the men who like healing too, since they get stupid comments around their masculinity in toxic groups etc
[1:43:40] msmester1: in showlands our raidgrup had like 3 moms in their 40s LUL
[1:44:12] Rendwee: You can buy those kinds of shirts at truck stops lol
[1:44:14] TheSonicDwarf: 3 bears looking at the moom
[1:44:20] TheSonicDwarf: moon*
[1:44:26] Kaseyfullofjoy: I can get the nature shirts from a truck stop? Tell me which one I need a wardrobe full XD
[1:44:32] Briibuns: i got into wow because my older brother started it when it came out. I realized i've been playing for 2 thirds of my life!
[1:44:43] Neltalie: i agree with this so much
[1:45:00] Rendwee: Depends on the truck stop
[1:45:09] msmester1: wish i had someone to play with irl
[1:45:10] jack_fraust: How would you get passed Kael'thas (Sun King Salvation) as a fury warrior
[1:45:19] jack_fraust: i have tried EVERYTHING
[1:45:30] jack_fraust: i used bandages
[1:45:36] Rendwee: Like soloing the boss from nathria?
[1:45:37] Kaseyfullofjoy: Now that i think of it I think a Love's truck stop may have one
[1:45:43] jack_fraust: he is a boss in Castle Nath
[1:45:47] StraightErro: healing raid fight
[1:45:49] Kurama__95: @jack_fraust BfA Azerite Power that heals might be the play
[1:45:50] sence_00: @jack_fraust use the heart of azeroth
[1:45:52] Tofterid: find a friend
[1:45:53] Rendwee: You can funnel on the one thing but besides that idk
[1:45:54] jack_fraust: FAK!@!!
[1:45:56] sence_00: or, it may not be doable
[1:46:11] Kurama__95: Oh HoA doesn't work in SL
[1:46:16] Rank7kaiju: You need to use the wells in order to heal him. I would suggest Heart of Azeroth, but it doesn't work in shadowlands due to not being on Azeroth
[1:46:23] Rendwee: I know you can only do the last boss in the temple of sethralis with the heart of azeroth
[1:46:24] jack_fraust: i have maxed azerite necklace still
[1:46:28] msmester1: i have a solution for you wait until war within and farm the warrior mog as a healer Kappa
[1:46:30] sence_00: HOA works in temple of sethralis so maybe?
[1:46:31] jack_fraust: it wont allow use in there
[1:46:31] mezzasalma: what expansion would u recommend a beginner to go for first?
[1:46:43] Rank7kaiju: At least that was the case when it was current, no idea if that's true now
[1:46:51] msmester1: arent you forced to bfa as new player?
[1:47:00] Rendwee: Beginner players are usually forced through BFA
[1:47:08] BanquosStepson: Maybe take the Mikonikos soulbind and hope that Bron will heal Kael.
[1:47:09] Kurama__95: Cata is probably the most beginner friendly, no overarching stories and very readable zones
[1:47:32] jack_fraust: I managed to get him to 35% lol working my tale off
[1:47:35] msmester1: i really like legion for leveling you do the order hall stuff in the meantime
[1:47:36] Protoman_702: bfa is decent horde side the city can be a little more confusing
[1:47:38] R1_Prototype: They automatically stick you on BFA storyline. But you can get any storyline starter quest from the mission board.
[1:47:46] jack_fraust: i thought maybe in your infinate wisdom
[1:47:50] jack_fraust: thank you though
[1:47:58] jack_fraust: your videos are the best
[1:48:03] lost_in_edmonton: its pretty good
[1:48:06] jack_fraust: i beg to differ
[1:48:09] InfiniFiasco: wow 30 bucks for the twilight set
[1:48:21] 1DirtyBirdy: loved bfa, especially exploring and doing all side quests xD
[1:48:37] msmester1: lmao the diff with that white tiger and my classic one is a lil bit jarring
[1:48:44] jack_fraust: of all the walk through's and help vids yours have been the most informal, least confusing and max results
[1:48:52] jack_fraust: so thank you actually
[1:49:13] jack_fraust: thats a lot of work for a content creater
[1:49:31] jack_fraust: absolutly you earned it
[1:50:22] cashthb: nothings wrong with it imo
[1:50:28] msmester1: you have to buy it now you have the matching staff LUL
[1:50:33] cashthb: I'd buy it twice
[1:50:35] InfiniFiasco: yeah I'll wait for the trading post
[1:50:44] jack_fraust: and yah i'm that guy since a week after burning crusades came out started playing a fury warrior and never looked back lol
[1:51:38] Oriosis: i pretty much only play my mage that ive had since vanilla
[1:51:43] Gurottesquex: Blood mage would be so sick
[1:51:43] witchhobbit: same sairaLUL
[1:51:45] jack_fraust: I have a BM Hunter, Destro Lock, Ret Pally, and DK
[1:51:46] azrazil720: I was a holy paladin main from vanilla to legion 😅😂
[1:51:50] msmester1: btw about you raid guides our guild had a dedicated channel to your videos :D
[1:51:52] sence_00: Like a Blood Troll?
[1:51:56] cashthb: you can be a spellslinger instead tho!
[1:51:56] StraightErro: a proper san'layn
[1:51:56] sence_00: Id be so down for that
[1:51:57] BanquosStepson: Compared to the price of a lot of shop mounts, it's not that bad of a price considering you're getting transmog on top of it, but still oof.
[1:51:59] itsparvati: necromancer
[1:52:01] blissy416: san'layn vampire
[1:52:07] jack_fraust: lol
[1:52:19] cashthb: I wanna tank tho :(
[1:52:34] jack_fraust: i do play others but Calipso is my breadwinner forever lol
[1:52:42] itsparvati: DKs are a hybrid imo, warrior/necro
[1:53:20] Aseopp: The move is to get the legendary then quite
[1:53:20] msmester1: my druid is called vampirebear and as a troll she turns into a bat i guess thats as far as wow goes LUL
[1:53:25] Jack_the_Dipper: We need a Necro. We have a melee and range holy and only a melee unholy
[1:53:45] delirious152007: we need a mail tank, Augvokers should have been the mail tank imo
[1:53:50] cashthb: well tarecgosas is technically a priest legendary and you didn't get it, just sayin'
[1:54:01] msmester1: shaman should have a tanks spec like in sod
[1:54:04] Ryok: i will probably regret buying it but i bought both the toy and the twilight set D:
[1:54:11] itsparvati: give shamans their tanking back
[1:54:32] vampire_enthusiast: The only classes I could really see them adding are tinkers or wardens/spellbreakers
[1:54:32] Octopixy1971: @Ryok haha me to still had enough battlenet balance
[1:54:40] Ryok: 10€ for a toy that transforms you into a murloc
[1:54:44] msmester1: imagine if one day you could play tank warlock and healing mage in reatil too
[1:54:53] anker_jym: It's a toy that let's you turn yourself and your party into Murlocs
[1:55:02] jack_fraust: Shaman can have tanking back if we get bladestorm back deal?
[1:55:04] Kaseyfullofjoy: YES
[1:55:13] Kaseyfullofjoy: pull the triggerrrrr
[1:55:20] Gurottesquex: The mount is REALLY pretty.
[1:55:21] StraightErro: shaman deserve a reason to use 2handed maces/axes that they can already equip, no just dual-wielding windfury
[1:55:28] loralahla: save the money and just grab em when they come back around
[1:55:42] cashthb: why is it soo cheap, wtf?
[1:55:57] msmester1: insatbuy
[1:56:07] Frejski1: barnaclus would rock that trading post set though!
[1:56:20] cashthb: if you can't beat 'em join 'em
[1:56:23] jack_fraust: fare enough@StraightErro
[1:56:25] Ryok: pretty much since i started playing i always wanted to play a murloc... now i finally can xD
[1:56:28] Dynnaamo: Hello @HazelNuttyGames and chat im happy to see you on *** are you today?
[1:56:37] Frejski1: oh god i need to see that hahah :D
[1:56:50] Dynnaamo: Im good doing vault stuffs
[1:57:04] Ryok: just sad it's a 1hr cd with 20 min duration D:
[1:57:26] jack_fraust: OMG!!!!
[1:57:30] Frejski1: fabulous
[1:57:38] snowcoconut: He looks fab
[1:57:42] msmester1: farms like these where i wish all my alts would be a vulpera...
[1:57:45] Soliz_: he is magical indeed
[1:57:49] jack_fraust: R U Serious!!! lollollolo
[1:58:41] jack_fraust: you playing that Kul dressed like that is EPIC!!! you have made my day ty lololololol
[1:59:03] anker_jym: Are the Mythic dungeon portals not permanent?
[1:59:04] jack_fraust: BUWAAAAAAA
[1:59:15] jack_fraust: i can't stop laughing
[1:59:15] msmester1: you could just get bfa enginnering on unused alts and use the wormhole
[1:59:54] anker_jym: Gotcha. That's where I was confused
[2:00:26] AzemT: Ayy nutty is playin

[2:00:31] delirious152007: they did said +20 where becoming account wide, but i hope its retroactive too
[2:00:37] AzemT: freehold soundtrack is pretty rad btw
[2:00:47] Hulkhokie: do you keep accumulating trading post tender after you get the 1k?
[2:00:53] Hulkhokie: or it stops at 1kmonth
[2:00:54] Hulkhokie: ?
[2:01:14] Ryok: i heard the portals will share cd across characters though D: which would really suck considering the cd is 8 hours
[2:01:59] Frejski1: it it the one-year anniversary of the trading post :D
[2:02:24] StraightErro: I think it's bad to account wide special achievements like keystone hero, otherwise everyone will just make a character to fit the god comp that's current to make it as easy and quick as possible, not necessarily playing the class you REALLY wanna play
[2:02:53] witchhobbit: just make mage alts for farming, all the endless teleports
[2:03:13] Rendwee: IDK Keystone hero giving you the tmog on every class sounds good to me
[2:03:29] hoebart21: Good morning from Australia!! You're my fav streamer right now, keep up the great work! Thanks.

[2:03:43] Rendwee: You can do all 20s on every spec in the game, it doesn't matter for you to play the meta
[2:03:45] cashthb: I'd keep the old ones character locked just to upset people
[2:03:57] Scroep11: yes, since you've done and technically "you" are behind every character that you play, so it make sense to be account wide
[2:03:58] Ryok: @StraightErro but that's literally what people already do? D: reroll for fotm
[2:04:16] Curufin_: nice hunter mog
[2:05:02] msmester1: btw random question am i the only one who just hoards hi boosts i can decide if i would want to play something new i would just level it :(
[2:05:10] CapitanNemo84: No redy
[2:05:18] sence_00: I need like a month to get my vicious mount at the rate im going
[2:05:28] sence_00: you were at 30ish?
[2:05:33] zannuss: Not even close. I still need the silly axe on my main and a ton of aspect crests on alts to upgrade hero items for mythic mog
[2:05:38] anker_jym: I have 4-PC on four of my characters, I think I'm good
[2:05:40] Gurottesquex: Not ready yet, still need to do some M+ and mythic raid stuff :<
[2:05:43] Gurottesquex: prob pvp eventually
[2:05:47] ghostie1995: still loosely working on getting the conquest set for dk
[2:05:48] delirious152007: im almost BIS 489 gear in all my slots on my main, i need them to start talking about 10.2.6 lol
[2:05:51] Hulkhokie: i spend most of my time trying to get battle pets, so no season goals for me
[2:06:02] Rank7kaiju: Let me get my funny fire axe first before season plz
[2:06:12] Zindrassil: i'm not ready to be done, but most of the guild has been playing palword :'(
[2:06:24] msmester1: i wish the preorder would come with server trasfer or you could choose
[2:06:44] zeusolga20: go go bird
[2:06:48] Habituron: i use my free boosts and often never touch the character again, especially if its a new class
[2:06:49] zeusolga20: :(
[2:07:03] conksalot: I have been wanting to use the new 70 boost on a preexisting 70 just to get the Reps to 20.
[2:07:10] Gurottesquex: Speaking of next patch though I wonder when we'll learn what the fated mount will be.
[2:07:12] cashthb: I feel like I'm ready for the next expac, maybe I hit ksh without tier next season to flex or something
[2:07:27] Streamlabs: Dynnaamo -> all links are devoured at once.
[2:07:29] Gurottesquex: next season not patch, sorry :x
[2:07:33] conksalot: Leveling is fun; rep grind is not fun.
[2:07:37] Hulkhokie: i used a boost as a "free server transfer" and i kind of regret it, you have SO MUCH catching up to do
[2:07:45] Habituron: yeah, it is tough to even jump into old toons with the new talents
[2:07:47] zeusolga20: this mog is nice but i dont know why we can hide pants in game until now
[2:08:03] zeusolga20: all characters have underwear by default
[2:08:13] Dynnaamo: i really like the white one
[2:08:31] msmester1: underwear transomg when LUL
[2:09:09] delirious152007: @Gurottesquex im hoping for the missing voted for mount that was voted for in shadowlands, the "caterpillar" i think it was
[2:09:11] cashthb: least degen weeb game
[2:09:21] msmester1: i hardly buy underwear irl not gonna buy wow LUL

[2:09:43] Jonboy4556: sometimes your troll just needs to feel beautiful
[2:09:47] zeusolga20: wow this week looks like anime land UwU with the trading post lol
[2:09:55] Dynnaamo: Thank you soo much i will try to find it for my blood elf priest

[2:17:28] msmester1: im gonna go now and try wish me luck LUL
[2:18:10] msmester1: i never had a moment where i just went to get a rare mount and get it first time
[2:18:17] Aseopp: That mog makes me want a druid. I know you dont like it, but its totally my thing
[2:18:22] Habituron: like a snow owl
[2:18:27] blueboywiz: it looks good with sepulcher mythic set
[2:18:28] emylinn: I want to start healing, is it easier with holy or discipline ? :)
[2:18:31] Perkolate: youre right i should go try for sharkbait once
[2:18:45] delirious152007: i currently have all my alts farming for Ashes....one day ill drop...
[2:18:49] witchhobbit: ooooh those colors are fun
[2:19:15] witchhobbit: like that set is pretty unique to me because of the color combo
[2:19:28] jessetenfour: Just made a priest and played disc for the first time after 16 years of playing and Disc is def tricky to figure out at first, but super fun once you do
[2:19:36] goplacidly56: is that pvp gear? missed convo, so pretty
[2:19:48] witchhobbit: @jessetenfour agree
[2:20:03] R1_Prototype: disc is easy to me. but disc is like a half dps half healer. you ARE a healer. that mostly heals through damage.
[2:20:05] witchhobbit: and i feel the same with holy pally
[2:20:19] witchhobbit: pally in general helped me feel more comfy with melee
[2:20:22] Frejski1: been leveling a disc priest to 66 in two days, it's so much fun in dungeons
[2:20:51] goplacidly56: thought so, so nice, wish I could get it but not happening lol
[2:20:54] AndersKool: where did the cat cam go ? =(
[2:21:22] Jonboy4556: did you just say meow?

[2:24:14] prttykttygrl: I love that they are increasing the drop rate of mounts through the timewalking raid rewards... but I've run about 20 toons each time and I still have no luck LOL
[2:24:22] msmester1: well the mount didnt drop
[2:24:29] ardilla808: battle mender is from 50 wins above 1800 as a healer in solo shuffle
[2:25:00] endless_pastrami: my ultimate wow goal is to get an unobtainable for warlock item like taeshalach or fyralak for my felguard
[2:25:05] Kurama__95: Try out the new set on Petalbloom Kappa
[2:25:27] pinkpaws_: theres a addon called notepad :D very usefull

[2:26:43] pinkpaws_: no not loginscreen but you can keep notes about random stuff
[2:26:47] msmester1: do you still do digs?
[2:26:47] kryptogirrl: is that the set that we are getting for finishing the feb trading post?
[2:27:06] helheimr: sadly I dont think you can get taeshalach for a warlock
[2:27:11] Habituron: send yourself a mail
[2:27:18] baroner25: what mount are you grinding for?
[2:27:19] Habituron: use mail as a bookmark
[2:27:33] sibimi: yeah, I saw many fedoras drop!
[2:27:34] daws001: oh nice. i was only missing the dig hat
[2:27:38] Ryok: @endless_pastrami i saw someone use fyralak on a surv hunter as mog xD
[2:27:38] solkana: Yes, I got the black hat in the last dig.
[2:27:57] Habituron: the other option is a stickynote on the monitor
[2:28:19] Habituron: probably not
[2:28:23] cashthb: windows sticky notes?
[2:28:51] Pockinet93: i have an excel sheet for my weekly alt stuff like mount farms. A little bit of an overkill, but it takes the stress off me to remember everything. Also there is the addon "savedinstances", you prob. already know it but i had to mention it anyways
[2:28:53] Cyberwolffe: I got a hat to drop from the dig I did earlier this morning.  Didn't know it hadn't been dropping
[2:28:59] Habituron: i know they're supposed to be gentle, but what if it left goo on your monitor? yuk
[2:29:02] msmester1: i work in it i have users who use the monitor for sticky notes and notes only and use the laptop screen....
[2:29:44] Jmpxg: what is your main class?
[2:30:04] cashthb: i got a burned in pixel right in the middle. it kinda does drive me insane
[2:30:24] msmester1: i say the same for the dirt on my screen LUL

[2:36:18] Phenroi: I bought the mount for 20k and that's all I wanted
[2:36:48] elliongrey: I will admit that the corsages are kind of cool xD
[2:36:59] kryptogirrl: where can i spend the dig coins?
[2:37:13] Ryok: for some reason when i go dig either there's a bilion people or 10 xD and from my experience the 10 usually get the same amount if not more tomes because there's so many afkers or people who don't know about doing tasks D:
[2:37:18] kryptogirrl: oh thank you!
[2:37:23] msmester1: i just remembered i have to do the tuskar feasts too NotLikeThis
[2:37:59] Ryok: @msmester1 i started doing those on 14 characters 2 weeks ago for flavor pocket chances... i really need the gold right now xD
[2:38:05] sence_00: i dont mind its there too too much since you have to go to the forbidden reach sometimes but otherwise its annoying
[2:39:02] watchCrimson: Do you think they would add an dragonriding travelform to druids in the future? I was so sad that I could not Soar as evoker in the Tindral boss fight
[2:39:08] sence_00: im tempted to save up purple tomes til DMF is up but i hate having stuff in my bags like that

[2:40:34] Natalie_8272: Im loving this months trading post, the items are so cuet
[2:40:35] Natalie_8272: cute

[2:40:44] Terra___l: @watchCrimson they said druid will get it but with start from war within
[2:40:50] MrIlluminOttey: @Rendwee mrillu1Caught4k

[2:45:40] anker_jym: Gonna take off a bit early today. I wish you luck in your Shuffling
[2:45:43] Arabany: Hm, not sure I've seen these quests.
[2:45:44] msmester1: the rope is probably popular in goldshire
[2:45:49] diarrhea_lad: I still haven't done any digs
[2:46:01] StraightErro: All they need to do is add a whip weapon, then they'll see what people REALLY wanna dress up as
[2:46:08] mrspawkats: awww purrs

[2:47:10] buttercup8404: @CurrentsWoW Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:47:10] wolfcloudchaser80: A whip weapon would be awesome. What would it be classified as, though? Sword? Mace?
[2:47:11] sence_00: how did you get an odd number? I thought it was 2% a win?
[2:47:34] CurrentsWoW: 0.5 per 2's win i think?
[2:47:56] CurrentsWoW: its been a while
[2:48:08] Natalie_8272: I was surprised that the rocket was cheap
[2:48:14] Rendwee: Its between 200 and 250 for 2s I thought
[2:48:34] diarrhea_lad: I've been stuck in 1400-1500 hell on my DK. I might just try 3s or something because Shuffle just is a sloooow grind
[2:48:54] Gurottesquex: Its nice to see the rocket so cheap for new players too so they can have a 2 person mount.
[2:48:57] Rendwee: I'm at 10% with 30 wins
[2:48:57] CurrentsWoW: im washed af :D if i get back into arena now its gonna have to absorb my existence again like it did in 2020
[2:49:14] msmester1: solo shuffle is just made for healers LUL
[2:50:06] sence_00: I did a bunch of 2s last night for the weekly and it was surprisingly fun
[2:50:09] Perkolate: i'm so washed you'll find me on the beachhh
[2:50:10] CurrentsWoW: not 100 games a day like back in home office :O
[2:50:22] msmester1: green classes only huh

[2:52:29] sence_00: Ive had a few rounds go well at the start only for DPS to all decide to murder me isntead
[2:52:29] diarrhea_lad: triple stealth comp is so annoying lol
[2:52:49] CurrentsWoW: if there's ever a reason to get out of instance chat your gonna find it in isle of conquest
[2:52:51] sandicheeks_: omg everytime i tune into stream you have awesome hairs!

[2:55:22] Octopixy1971: LUL
[2:55:28] sence_00: do you have to go 3/3 minimum to get progress? I keep forgetting if 2/4 counts
[2:55:34] pinkpaws_: my husband reccomended your stream cus we do kinda same thing in wow and he said you are always nice and friendly. I cant stand rude and mean ppl and so many are now in wow
[2:55:37] CurrentsWoW: almost as good as the your mechagnome hunters pets back in the day
[2:55:54] diarrhea_lad: @sence_00 at certain rankings 3/3 doesn't even give progress anymore
[2:56:04] diarrhea_lad: could be different for healers though
[2:56:15] CurrentsWoW: cough cogh https://www.twitch.tv/hazelnuttygames/clip/FunColdbloodedPizzaPicoMause?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time cough cough
[2:56:26] sence_00: @diarrhea_lad for mount? yikes

[3:01:03] sence_00: oh how are you getting crests for gear upgrades on this toon
[3:01:07] CurrentsWoW: the imperfection is part of the charm with homemade bread
[3:01:21] sence_00: I need drake crests apparently and SS doesnt give that
[3:01:26] CurrentsWoW: i know i know call me cliche
[3:01:52] Aseopp: Perfectly imperfect
