[6:26:18] GiantRatGuy: for s1 we were stacking haste up to SOFTcap
[6:26:22] GiantRatGuy: which was 25%
[6:26:26] GiantRatGuy: then mastery was better
[6:27:32] GiantRatGuy: im not sure how to explain it , once you hit 25% haste the extra haste is not as good as mastery
[6:27:38] GiantRatGuy: idk why they call it a softcap though
[6:27:58] hoonty: LUL
[6:28:32] AnarkiPlays: @GiantRatGuy Because it's not hard limited in-game and is optional.

[6:29:13] AnarkiPlays: hepperLOVE hepperLOVE
[6:29:57] bogof01: usually it means when you reach your softcap that's the % where you gain the most benefit as stats DR after a certain % the value to reach hardcap is never worth pushing for (usually it's 40% after 25%) to gain value over "another" stat.. hope that explains it lol
