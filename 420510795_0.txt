[1:34:09] Sloot: @jordofthepies yeah sure sounds great!
[1:34:12] enikma_: @Zorbrix Seriously, will there be Infested in LAN keys? Would be pretty fun for some change in metas
[1:34:23] Keida__: Sub rogue meta
[1:34:26] Rikkycurtis: and why have arms warrior, lol they are nub
[1:34:28] defskull: blood dk dmg? 4Head
[1:34:32] gekkos: blood dk dmg, we wrath now boys
[1:34:33] Zorbrix: Maybe for BlizzCon
[1:34:43] thenipple420: is there a way to see the gear/talents they are using
[1:34:44] WorldFirstWipe: Yeah, bursting is definitely the reason it's prot warr two rogues a ww and resto druid on both teams
[1:34:45] Cuff_: wow love this class variety
[1:34:47] Its_Ketsuki: Infested is never fun
[1:34:48] Morningst4R: DK is fine, Warrior is just OP atm
[1:34:53] WorldFirstWipe: That's absolutely only because of bursting, you got it
[1:34:55] Warler5: bringing back infested LUL
[1:34:58] XxALucaRDxX001: dk is weak in fort week :(
[1:35:14] Jadirr: @theblacknipple420 look to the side of the screen at the small overlay you can expand
[1:35:15] enikma_: Fun to watch for sure :P
[1:35:18] Sythka: assassin and sub rogues BibleThump
[1:35:19] chinacat44: rip
[1:35:38] iRipcord: @Sythka you dont raid do you?
[1:35:41] Cuff_: its funny that they use a dps meter for their streams but wont put one in game
[1:35:45] ZarisHeal: West > East
[1:35:46] Dextline: Make infested +2 affix
[1:35:46] Zorbrix: Level 30 Kings' Rest Tyrannical Quaking Infested Reaping
[1:35:52] gcscav: @Sloot I'd like to see something like a banning phase before matches aka each team can ban like 1 class or maybe 2-3 speccs
[1:35:56] XxALucaRDxX001: no one want warrior arms BibleThump
[1:36:12] Sythka: @therealripcord this is MDI lol
[1:36:13] naxxius: @Zorbrix id pay to see naowh tank that
[1:36:17] r0hxtv: imagine that double rogue monk
[1:36:20] dolby24j: bans would be stupid
[1:36:21] enikma_: @Zorbrix You forgot to add the s3 affix bubbling Kappa
[1:36:27] ZarisHeal: yeah i would like to use a blizzard made dps meter, i dont like to use 3rd party addons.
[1:36:30] saltynutbush: cool unique comps
[1:36:35] Drezitu: @gcscav don't work. People will play the next best team. Same comp on both sides
[1:36:36] Sleepypan: thats such a moronic idea @gcscav
[1:36:40] Zorbrix: Maybe Vaping can become an affix
[1:36:43] Technically_PvP: Seems too premeditated @Zorbrix ... need to go back to the dart board. :D
[1:36:51] Kahlandra: @Zorbrix pls...no...
[1:36:51] wy6ix: dunno when blizzard wants to balance every class
[1:36:57] Sloot: @zorbrix bruh
[1:37:03] Sleepypan: vaping is lame
[1:37:08] naxxius: @ZarisTwitch that dmg meter is a 3rd party addon
[1:37:13] enikma_: DansGame
[1:37:15] gcscav: @Sleepypan so having always the same comp is not a stupid thing in itself?
[1:37:17] ZarisHeal: they cant balance %100 its impossible.
[1:37:19] NilesyFM: @Sloot did you like my spriests transmog? his shiny head matched yours
[1:37:21] defskull: vaping becoming an affix? what's the effect? watermelon shroud mist? :D
[1:37:25] NilesyFM: @Sloot I gave you a crown tho
[1:37:33] Sleepypan: its not always the same comps @gcscav
[1:37:43] henkke: same comp both teams ResidentSleeper
[1:37:48] ZarisHeal: @naxxius yeah its why i say they would make an ingame addon something simple.
[1:38:01] Sleepypan: and yeah seeing teams that its actually about them playing better than wow this class has some broken op thing they can do @gcscav
[1:38:01] wy6ix: @zaristwitch yeah but they can at least balance it like 80%
[1:38:02] defskull: this is the comp for the whole event my dood
[1:38:03] Technically_PvP: @gcscav Do you complain all the people driving the same cars in a race (nascar/formula...)
[1:38:07] syndenbock: @Sleepypan it is alaways the same comps per dungeon.
[1:38:08] Rinni1990: @defskull lol low vis, like the Kvaldir on islands
[1:38:11] r0hxtv: i feel like this ww on both sides are doing no damage
[1:38:15] gcscav: @Sleepypan yeah I know, warriortank, rdruid, rogue, monk, +1
[1:38:15] picc0: @gcscav mdi is a speed race - which makes teams use the obvious meta to speed up as fast as possible
[1:38:17] Sleepypan: there is always going to be different metas
[1:38:20] dolby24j: @gcscav on high competitve scene? its not stupid, everyone wants to play the best spec
[1:38:21] gcscav: totally not the same every single time
[1:38:24] Sleepypan: no its not @syndenbock
[1:38:25] Thomas91170: !uptime
[1:38:31] Sleepypan: did you guys miss the last one?
[1:38:35] Sloot: @nilesyfm I actually loled while naguura was casting for true moment when the cam zoomed in on you and I saw a goblin crown. That‚Äôs I I mentioned it after when you guys were doing trash in front of council
[1:38:42] r0hxtv: just need to apply d to b
[1:38:54] Walkynator: which key levels will be played on LAN?
[1:38:59] henkke: ResidentSleeper
[1:39:01] dazedsean: they should make the MDI teams play as horde so no shadowmeld lol
[1:39:02] Kromede: slootSmug
[1:39:02] Sleepypan: also these classes are best for speed runs cry more because you think you need to play meta class to be able to do a weekly 10+ LUL
[1:39:10] ZarisHeal: @persianassassin92 balancing is really complicated. i think they r doing what they can. in other games i saw worst balance issues. in wow its kinda not bad.
[1:39:17] Clownbox: D:
[1:39:20] fullmoose: w
[1:39:24] ProSwagger: O snap new comps this MDI PogChamp JK ResidentSleeper
[1:39:29] LordOfChange: Fined D:
[1:39:29] NilesyFM: @sloot big ups my man! :D
[1:39:37] Sleepypan: top keys you see many different comps not just this
[1:39:38] henkke: LULW
[1:39:46] ZarisHeal: u just feeling unbalanced issues top tier mythic runs.
[1:39:49] mykulpierce: going for a zero sum balance is not healthy for an mmo
[1:39:53] Sythka: comp diversity Kappa
[1:39:55] holygod_1: i'm seeing the new heart of azeroth traits and i don't like it
[1:39:57] Sleepypan: @ProSwagger you mustve missed the last match
[1:40:06] Sloot: @nilesyfm I miss the big papa though
[1:40:23] Tuanesto: that back peddler tho
[1:40:23] NilesyFM: @Sloot It's okay, thebigpapa tanks keys in live
[1:40:30] NilesyFM: @sloot as an actual tank, not ripping keys
[1:40:32] chozzz: are both teams playing as alliance?
[1:40:33] Keida__: high keys are always Prot, Resto, Rogue, DH, and a ranged
[1:40:35] NilesyFM: :d
[1:40:38] lexiahx: @holygod_1 that's not good :(
[1:40:42] Sleepypan: outside of mdi there is many different classes in higher key levels
[1:40:53] henkke: 12 classes 4Head cant even manage them to be balanced 4Head
[1:40:55] Insaynee: Lota is an absolute unit
[1:40:56] NilesyFM: @sloot also, FYI, I was on about two hours sleep before yesterdays MDI, and I had a lot of beers beforehand
[1:40:58] Sloot: @nilesyfm hell yeah
[1:41:09] wy6ix: @zaristwitch yeah but its not good if u want to win m+ u have to play op classes only
[1:41:10] gcscav: yes there are a lot of different classes in higher rankings
[1:41:12] Drezitu: @Keida__ Yes, raider io is lying for us. The shadow priest, ret pally is a lie T.T
[1:41:13] Sloot: @nilesyfm as long as it wasn‚Äôt coors light
[1:41:21] ProSwagger: This isn't "outside of MDI". We're watching MDI. I'm sure in lower level keys there's alot of clases as well FailFish
[1:41:22] mykulpierce: @Sleepypan There is no reason to do +19 in retail of course you see all kinds of classes
[1:41:25] gcscav: but do you know how hard it is to get a rnd grp as ret paladin? @Sleepypan
[1:41:28] blackmaija: the problem with wow balance is that certain classes ( rogue) is way too op compared to what. other classes bring
[1:41:29] gcscav: I bet you dont
[1:41:36] guccigaming: @Keida__ HI
[1:41:37] Sleepypan: no you dont @persianassassin92
[1:41:46] NilesyFM: @sloot aussies say beers but I was actually on the bourbons !
[1:41:49] ZarisHeal: @persianassassin92 if u do not target top tier m+ runs all specs are enough i think.
[1:42:02] Sloot: @nilesyfm now we‚Äôre talking my man
[1:42:03] gcscav: @blackmaija the problem is, they dont want to change it
[1:42:06] Keida__: @GuccithongDH hey bb
[1:42:06] ZarisHeal: @persianassassin92 i even healing well with my holy priest.
[1:42:10] Asch427: @Devolore Great GTA RP, almost as good as your communication with the community Kappa
[1:42:10] Sleepypan: any spec can do upto 20 keys
[1:42:17] Sleepypan: stop making excuses for yourself
[1:42:20] mykulpierce: @gcscav game is not designed for +19 M+ runs its just a fun past time
[1:42:22] Keida__: @GuccithongDH i just lost all my gold to dicegirl
[1:42:24] iRipcord: @gcscav i bring ret paladins to my 15+ keys
[1:42:25] Dota360: only damage coming out is quaking, better cleave and die
[1:42:27] wy6ix: @zaristwitch who not like to hit high m+
[1:42:28] Dota360: wtf
[1:42:35] Sleepypan: @gcscav nah i run with a ret paladin a lot
[1:42:39] Sleepypan: ret pumps @gcscav
[1:42:45] naxxius: @Sloot i have a bottle of crown waiting for us while your here ;)
[1:42:45] iRipcord: sleepy is 100% right
[1:42:55] NilesyFM: @Sloot I owe you a beer if you're ever in Melbourne
[1:43:03] Sloot: @naxxius yum
[1:43:05] Fappy23: lol nagura
[1:43:07] iCresp: when u argue with ur girl on air
[1:43:16] iRipcord: every class in this game can do a 20 key, that doesnt mean every single one of you is good enough to do a 20 key
[1:43:17] Excelution: #bwn
[1:43:18] awsmsauce1: looool you get it nagura111
[1:43:19] Sleepypan: mdi shouldve been in Melbourne not Sydney
[1:43:19] Nisk99: you cant send monka S in this channel?
[1:43:21] Brackker: krippPog
[1:43:21] Nisk99: LUL
[1:43:25] Sloot: @nilesyfm dunno how close to that but lan
[1:43:27] RIP_EU_DENTIST: HotPokket
[1:43:31] jankeloffen: How are they doing 100k dps geez
[1:43:40] gcscav: oh I know that @Sleepypan , but the ret in my guild just doesnt want to search for a key for >1 hour cuz people only want metacomps
[1:43:41] naxxius: Sydney > melb
[1:43:50] Sleepypan: exactly @therealripcord so people would rather cry and blame "not being meta"
[1:43:57] NilesyFM: @naxxius said no one ever
[1:44:02] Sleepypan: thats when u make ur own groups
[1:44:08] naxxius: :)
[1:44:11] Excelution: how hard is it to pug a 20 key?
[1:44:13] iRipcord: exactly
[1:44:20] Drezitu: he is trying to pug a +20 key, and this is a Blizz problem? @gcscav
[1:44:20] iRipcord: push your own keys
[1:44:24] Drezitu: LUL
[1:44:28] Chubby_Alpaca: Piece of cake
[1:44:30] naxxius: I would rather drive in syd > Melb having lived in melb for 7 years cba
[1:44:31] Drezitu: ^
[1:44:33] mykulpierce: @gcscav why doing pugs? Get people that do keys together and stick with it
[1:44:34] Stormyse1337: hey
[1:44:40] gcscav: @Drezitu ???
[1:44:42] tinywulf: look its the same classes!
[1:44:44] holygod_1: @valexia some classes have enough abilities and gcd is restricting them and they add traits which need to be used and it's on gcd
[1:44:49] Sleepypan: ive sat longer looking for groups @gcscav
[1:44:49] tinywulf: as i saw last month
[1:44:52] highlyripped: pretty hard to pug a 20, solely because there isnt alot of pugs doing 20's ther's a very low population doing 20's
[1:44:54] mykulpierce: Don't expect getting up to MDI level just pugging
[1:44:55] DreamHatcher: r1 meld
[1:45:03] Sleepypan: @naxxius no freaking way
[1:45:13] Leninay: eastern teams actually playing PogChamp
[1:45:15] AndyTheNoqui: Is every team picking warrior for the dmg output over other tanks defensives??
[1:45:23] Bare_Minimum: Where is the female caster from? I can't identify her accent.
[1:45:23] ZarisHeal: oh man these nightelves really op they just fixed ninja pull issue
[1:45:29] Drezitu: Yes, Andy
[1:45:31] ZarisHeal: with passive
[1:45:33] iRipcord: warrior because of damage and buff
[1:45:34] Sleepypan: eh depends @highlyripped
[1:45:39] Taciturne4463: AndyTheNoqui Warrior defensives are awesome too
[1:45:42] Stormyse1337: warrior has the defensve too
[1:45:44] Leninay: @AndyTheNoqui warrior is also really good def wise
[1:45:44] naxxius: Yeah hard pass on most of melbournes traffic only good traffic in that city is eastlink
[1:45:47] MimirTheAesir: @Bare_Minimum She lives in switzerland in the german part.
[1:45:56] blackmaija: @sleepypan im not trying to give an excuse but i have to que for 2+h for an m+ as a warlock cos im nit meta, whoever has the key is probably non meta as well so they want at least a rogue+2nd interrupt (1,8k rio and i dont get invites to 14 keys)
[1:45:58] highlyripped: i got a 2300 io resto druid and it is in the top 300 allaince druid and top 1000 in the world, meaning there is only about 1000 resto druids even playign at the 20+ lvl
[1:46:03] picc0: @Battlecookieplaysgames no, in italy
[1:46:07] Sleepypan: i wont drive in the actual city tho @naxxius
[1:46:09] chuffingbear: italy german part
[1:46:12] naxxius: but its personal preference /shrug
[1:46:14] chuffingbear: south tyrol
[1:46:19] iRipcord: @blackmaija whats your io?
[1:46:23] AndyTheNoqui: Prot warrior is the only tank class I don't have at 120
[1:46:29] ZarisHeal: btw raider io = toxicity
[1:46:32] Sleepypan: make ur own groups,reroll or stop crying @blackmaija
[1:46:39] Kahlandra: Today's casters are Daniel "AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Ted "Sloot" Bacinschi, Caroline "Naguura" Forer, Aaron "Sours" Shaffer, and Peyton "Tettles" Tettleton
[1:46:44] blackmaija: @therealripcord 1,8k
[1:46:44] chozzz: outlaw rogue needs an aoe nerf, or buff other classes
[1:46:44] Sythka: guys push keys with me my io is 500 Kappa
[1:46:48] Raziel767: !bracket
[1:46:48] iRipcord: you say your 1.8k io and your running 14s?
[1:46:50] AndyTheNoqui: oh and a DH but DHs omegalol
[1:46:56] iRipcord: thats strange
[1:46:59] naxxius: Yeah im taking train to sydney not really wanting to drive there either but pref there to melb
[1:47:03] mykulpierce: @ZarisTwitch getting mad about a tool for managing pugs while not developing your own social skills is more toxic
[1:47:03] enikma_: @Kahlandra New bot PogChamp
[1:47:03] blackmaija: reroll LUL good answer
[1:47:04] ZarisHeal: yep nagura is one of the caster there
[1:47:05] Nisk99: raiderio makes me feel attaked can we get it banend please
[1:47:10] Kahlandra: beep boop MrDestructoid
[1:47:10] gcscav: @ZarisTwitch the addon is not toxicity in itself, it's the stupid people using the addon
[1:47:12] Sleepypan: @ZarisTwitch not sure if your trolling or not
[1:47:29] Sleepypan: ^
[1:47:41] Masqerader: oh look dual comps, the variety of this boring mdi is astounding, no wonder it only gets 8k views
[1:47:50] Sleepypan: wow what an interesting comment @Banzi26 never seen that one before
[1:47:50] ZarisHeal: i saw many noobs got high rio ranks and just ruined my runs.
[1:47:56] iRipcord: there will always be the "best classes" in every game
[1:47:57] sandister_: wait what if you don't do mechanics its trouble???
[1:48:01] mykulpierce: @gcscav Pugs have no obligation to accept people
[1:48:02] Sleepypan: what an interesting comment @Masq33 never seen that one before
[1:48:03] Sythka: I identify as a 2300 raider io mythic plus dps, they need an option so I can change my score to that
[1:48:04] Bovinity: Why do people even whine about "same comp", do you really care if it's a warrior in melee hitting things instead of a WW or something?
[1:48:05] ZarisHeal: ppl boosting their rio ranks and its stupid
[1:48:10] Brackker: slootKappa
[1:48:10] Excelution: i cant get key invites as a dps war -_-
[1:48:15] Leninay: @Banzi26 well in a mirror match you can 100% blame it on better strat and execution. rather than having mage in black rook hold and warlock in arcway
[1:48:16] AndyTheNoqui: Because no one is actually playing that much to try different M+18 comps
[1:48:16] gcscav: @Fox_Tango ???
[1:48:16] Sleepypan: @ZarisTwitch do you go to the site and look or just go off score
[1:48:17] NilesyFM: @Sloot *** hahaha I love you
[1:48:26] Sleepypan: if u dont go site thats ur own fault
[1:48:31] BalsBigBrother: Your runs so not a team effort @ZarisTwitch
[1:48:33] GazagonFTW: !gear
[1:48:36] Trohuz: the point is to see who can pull off their stragety better, which is actually easier to see when they're using mirror comps :)
[1:48:45] Trohuz: *strategy
[1:48:49] mykulpierce: @ZarisTwitch It effects random groups. If you use your social skills you are not affected by it
[1:48:51] NilesyFM: <***>
[1:49:17] blackmaija: @therealripcord i have 1,8k i got before warlock nerfs when ppl invited locks for their dmg, now no invites even for low keys, even though i have several +17-18 fone in time
[1:49:23] dazedsean: @Akinciler night elf for shadowmeld
[1:49:30] AndyTheNoqui: @GazagonFTW they're capped at 415, you can check gear with the twitch addon if you want
[1:49:32] Sleepypan: wahhh i cant get into 10 keys not playing a non meta class raiderio is toxic better ban the addon LUL
[1:49:35] ZarisHeal: yeah i must use my social skill for my da mn run.
[1:49:48] XxALucaRDxX001: wtf
[1:49:50] mr_jimbone: Wonder what the interview process was to become a caster for MDI?
[1:49:55] kruppe17: NA LUL
[1:49:57] slugg_tk: @fox_tango fox wow players' social skills LUL
[1:49:57] lucashowmuchpain: he got sniped and killed him and the heal
[1:49:57] blogchamp: interesting group comp havent seen this
[1:49:59] lucashowmuchpain: lulWW
[1:50:01] myamoray: oh look, same complaints about the comps. If they were exactly the same, then we wouldn't have winners or losers each match. Having the same comps allows us to see skill in execution.
[1:50:05] Invenit: @NilesyFM Big fan
[1:50:16] Candyfriend: ResidentSleeper alright back to boring comps
[1:50:22] Sleepypan: interesting comment i havent seen one like yours @blogchamp LUL
[1:50:25] ch7777: imagine playing wow in 2019
[1:50:26] mykulpierce: @winged_alpaca yeah excuse me I guess only classic players know about social skills to play the game
[1:50:27] NilesyFM: @Invenit thanks bro
[1:50:31] iRipcord: if you cant do 10 keys you should just stop playing
[1:50:33] ZarisHeal: actually raider io is currently more of what its targeted first times. its a huge problem for wow.
[1:50:34] Saltychip: great comp ResidentSleeper
[1:50:34] blackmaija: tbh i dont care anymore, i quit the game so blizz can keep doing what they want with their dying game
[1:50:39] NilesyFM: @Invenit BMC back and better than ever next season dw
[1:50:39] blogchamp: @Sleepypan haHAA
[1:50:42] Heidenvise: this is so boring
[1:50:44] Heidenvise: same cmops
[1:50:46] Heidenvise: comps
[1:50:48] XxALucaRDxX001: WOW IN 2K19 ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:50:53] gcscav: @myamoray if there'd be actual balance between classes you could see that with different comps too
[1:50:57] mykulpierce: @ZarisTwitch entitled players are bigger problem
[1:51:04] JerzyDerz: its always this cimp lately
[1:51:06] Invenit: @NilesyFM I heard the monk was lacking
[1:51:09] beetle101st: yet your still here watching the game you claim too qit
[1:51:10] Candyfriend: @NilesyFM can you sign my baby
[1:51:11] maggmarbackwards: But if they run the same comps we get to see proper skill no?
[1:51:15] Sleepypan: the system exists to show you what you need to *** shows the persons experience in keys. SHows how many they have done, what affixes, have they timed them
[1:51:20] Morningst4R: Lazarus back from the dead LUL
[1:51:21] blogchamp: we see more comp diversity in arena LUL
[1:51:31] JerzyDerz: losen role restrictions leme see 5 blood dks vs 5 affy locks
[1:51:31] MisterBrando: Anyone know how long brez timer is?
[1:51:35] ZarisHeal: wow itself can make a m+ leaderboard and ranks for a pve content. so we wouldnt need raiderio.
[1:51:54] eyeree: saying wow in 2019 after opening the warcraft stream achhPEGA
[1:52:01] Leninay: @MisterBrando 10min
[1:52:11] Morningst4R: but my 370 ilvl feral druid with 200 rio is really good I just haven't been given the chance Kappa
[1:52:12] Yyve: People hanging in a WoW channel complaining about WoW in 2019
[1:52:14] Sleepypan: you would still have it though @ZarisTwitch

[1:52:21] myamoray: just my opinion, but it's far more obvious with these comps. @gcscav I get why some people get frustrated with similar comps, but if not this, then they'd be complaining about something else.

[1:52:30] mykulpierce: @ZarisTwitch People use RadIO for managing randoms. Use your social skills to form a group you play with and get better with together. Your raid IO stats will improve naturally

[1:52:38] sandister_: @Sleepypan and it means nothing, i know a few including me Mythic raiders that don't do keys, when we choose to do keys people won't invite cause IO
[1:52:42] iRipcord: @ZarisTwitch the problem is you, not the class or the system

[1:53:22] Leninay: raider io isnt the issue, but rahter the stupidity of the people using it
[1:53:25] mykulpierce: @Sandister_ If you are expecting to be invited by random groups because you feel entitled to a spot you are the problem not the addon
[1:53:29] AndyTheNoqui: A pve leaderboard would make the game more toxic. People screaming all over io are not quite the funniest players to play with
[1:53:30] Sleepypan: @Sandister_ wow i wonder why they wouldnt take mythic raiders with 0 experience in a key to a key when they could take someone who has done multiple keys. Use your brain or stick to doing keys with your "mythic raiders"
[1:53:43] gcscav: @myamoray I want to watch more of mdi, but if it's the same classes all over again I only need to watch 10 dungeons runs with the same lineup to know what's the go to strategy
[1:54:08] myamoray: @Banzi26 ofc, and I like the sunny days too, but I guess, I can find enjoyment with the non obvious!
[1:54:10] blogchamp: why is chat so angry LUL
[1:54:12] Leninay: 30 minutes LUL
[1:54:13] Sleepypan: @Sandister_ think Limit proved pretty well that being a "mythic" raider doesnt mean you can just go in and be a key god
[1:54:18] giigamega: @ZarisTwitch I'd donate to rio, just cause I keeps me from playing with you

[1:55:39] ZarisHeal: @DeluxeWins who the h3ll r you and something must keep me away from u lul.
[1:55:40] sandister_: @Fox_Tango @Sleepypan @therealripcord we have experience and + the keys we just don't do lot so the score low and no one invites
[1:55:41] mykulpierce: never mind dont care
[1:55:41] Taciturne4463: raider io score is more accurate than ilvl, you can't do better, it's just an indicator, use it correctly and everything will be fine
[1:55:51] myamoray: slootJSmug
[1:56:01] mykulpierce: @Sandister_ How would any random know that if they dont know you?
[1:56:03] XxALucaRDxX001: @Morningst4R Jebaited
[1:56:03] imokwiththis: This game needs more than 4 classes
[1:56:04] Technically_PvP: It was around WOTLK and CATA @AndyTheNoqui
[1:56:05] Sleepypan: get the score then or sign up for keys more your level
[1:56:11] Fluffshock: this is close
[1:56:15] iRipcord: @Sandister_ if you had the same experience as us you would have an io score around us
[1:56:20] Sleepypan: we could see your experience on the website @Sandister_
[1:56:23] jankeloffen: @Fox_Tango Who am I? Some one who got under your skin enough for you to personally address me dolt.
[1:56:25] AndyTheNoqui: WoW players using community tools correctly LUL
[1:56:27] maggmarbackwards: wow this is close

[1:56:59] Technically_PvP: yeah.. that thing @gcscav
[1:57:01] FallaciousAl: mother m'lode
[1:57:02] ZarisHeal: close match SeemsGood
[1:57:02] Morningst4R: @Sandister_ doing lots of keys doesn't increase your score, that's kind of one issue with it. It's just the highest you've done
[1:57:05] Sleepypan: @Sandister_ say your score is low because you havent done all the keys we could still see oh that guy has done an 18 of that dungeon just hasnt done Seige at all kinda thing

[1:57:13] mykulpierce: The problem is that you are expecting randoms to behave in a certain way regardless of the tools they have available to use as a guage to invite random players to their groups
[1:57:15] AndyTheNoqui: We all know the important thing here is that Method lost to Pieces
[1:57:17] blogchamp: great game you can die and still be world champion LUL

[1:58:59] mykulpierce: @AndyTheNoqui its how the game is played
[1:59:00] Senurotowicz: 12s interrupt vs 24s cd interrupt, means a lot
[1:59:04] Sleepypan: must be bad at the game then @Taciturne4463
[1:59:16] myamoray: @Taciturne4463 lol
[1:59:23] Morningst4R: in Vanilla you just didn't invite anyone you didn't know, and you kicked people the first minute they did something wrong because you had to assume they were bad
[1:59:27] Taciturne4463: Kappa
[1:59:28] sandister_: @Fox_Tango @therealripcord @Sleepypan I was huge in to Mythic + in legion daily doing 10-15 i have done all the duegons in Bfa but don't enjoy it anymore. just cause you don't do keys everyday doesn't mean you can't go in and do just as well as anyone else. Most of the time when i do them I' was carrying guilides to get gear so we weren't keying only trying to complete high keys for gear. Raider Io doesnt reflect that
[1:59:30] Daggerstry: @Taciturne4463 Do you also take only night elves?
[1:59:37] Pogggs: jak is my hero
[1:59:39] mykulpierce: @gcscav Random people is not general. Its who you are complaining about
[1:59:44] tankatudo: the game is dead, Free to Play 2020.
[1:59:46] BigBoyJeb: times have changed, people aren‚Äôt going to play the same ways
[1:59:51] ZarisHeal: btw wow classic will be dead after 2 months.
[2:00:03] Senurotowicz: +higher keys (15+) im doing once per week, there is no point to do more
[2:00:09] spiritsays: 2 months is generous though there's a difference between "dead" and Dead Kappa
[2:00:10] Taciturne4463: Daggerstry Yes but i'm horde, so I dont do a lot of keys FeelsBad
[2:00:11] Trohuz: @Technically_PvP it's like some people get offended, when others like to differentiate and compare themselves to others, and since ilvl isn't an indicator anymore for a while now something else had to come (which does also have its flaws) but it's more close to an actual score of skill than what we had until then
[2:00:15] blogchamp: what? in vanilla you spam trade chat for 2 hours to find ANYONE that wants to walk to the random 5 man you were doing LUL
[2:00:18] justsimlol: +4 AD, pushing, need rogue
[2:00:20] mykulpierce: @Sandister_ from that it sounds like you dont put the time in and so your stats suffer, how do other groups know your experience? You are complaining strangers dont know how good you are
[2:00:21] Sleepypan: @Sandister_ theres a lot changed since legion... and sorry but people were doing high 20s in legion so 10-15 doesnt mean anything now
[2:00:35] tangentbords_krigaren: dats why u skip at teh end of the dungeon instead: D

[2:01:01] iRipcord: @Sandister_ dude you're just proving our point, you say you dont do the high keys, so you dont have the experience that we do, and dont say your legion score counts because it doesnt
[2:01:11] IrohaWoW: I feel the same, WoW Classic is not compatible with the actual players... up weapon skills, make your own bullets and poisons, have to feed the pet... too hard.
[2:01:17] Kahlandra: i take offense to that @Andallyn

[2:01:56] iRipcord: @LoveUrselfo whats your bnet, ill add you buddy
[2:01:57] sandister_: @Fox_Tango i put in my time with raiding and with the current bs azerite system the bis traits for raids are in the raid gear so there is 0 point to do them for me.
[2:02:00] Kahlandra: lol :-)
[2:02:03] Archx1: CLASSIC RELEASE PLZ
[2:02:04] mykulpierce: It baffles me that people expect to be invited to keys by random people.
[2:02:06] Technically_PvP: @Trohuz I appreciate the want for a screen to help high level players find people that didn't fake/pay their way to that level for obvious reasons.
[2:02:08] ZarisHeal: i played vanilla when i was a child and im 30 yo and never asked for classic. the past in the past. thats all.
[2:02:11] Trohuz: @myamoray i just slept in my seat for about an hour slootLUL slootDerp
[2:02:13] Sleepypan: @Sandister_ was doing 20s from the first season of Legion so i wouldnt really call that having experience in high keys. You want people to invite you because you are a "m,ythic raider" so again i say to you why bring you to a 20 and not someone who has actually done them
[2:02:15] habsare24: @Taciturne4463 nore titanum and more chances at 225 titanforges
[2:02:16] mykulpierce: @Sandister_ How do randoms know that?

[2:02:16] ashketchumb: Im full listed, so you cant tbh. @therealripcord

[2:02:51] Technically_PvP: @Trohuz I do dislike arbitrary number gates for access in an MMO
[2:02:56] Taciturne4463: habsare24 It's very small amount of titanum, and just more chance on RNG stuff that you cannot chose from the end of dungeon, so nothing worth

I have done keys at high level i only do like 1 a month therefore cause i don't have the quantity the score doesn't stack. The quality is fine but the I.o score is fine.

[2:12:07] holygod_1: @Trohuz You are correct, lot of people who play mythic+ also raid but just because you've done a raid on first day doesn't mean you know every mechanic in mythic+. Yeah they might be good players and know their rotation and etc but overall they don't have the experience for mythic+ if they don't play it.

[2:13:00] justeko2: so again, why would i invite you over a guy with the quantity? quantity = practice = less mistakes and better reaction to chaos @Sandister_

[2:14:15] TheQuadler: Im amazed this is a thing, so does the winner just end up being the team who had the best RNG over the last few months of drops since wow is just diablo now? should they start diablo compeitions like this now for Grifts?
[2:14:17] ChaosEmperor24: @therealripcord PvP bruh.
[2:14:19] Morningst4R: I think there will be enough core classic players to keep it running, it might end up with few servers or sharded, but it'll last after the hype

[2:14:26] ChaosEmperor24: @therealripcord hang out with community

[3:27:14] Achw3l: legion dungeons were awesome
[3:27:15] morte9x: @highvoltage988 can they change race freely on the tournament realm? and isn't there something so only one player can change class, spec and race?

[3:28:38] highvoltage988: @Mortenix yeah they can have as many toons as needed on the realms for practice, but yes there are rules on how many players can change toons between maps, which includes race swaps

[3:32:12] Gurthang117: @Trohuz its still quite ahead in ST than all other tanks tho
[3:32:22] sirhyl: you cant dispatch with dagger in main :(
[3:32:28] morte9x: @highvoltage988 makes sense. I did think there was a restriction with how many could change toon. but did not know players could have as many toons as they wanted. for some reason I thought max one of each class. but thanks for new info :)
[3:32:35] Trohuz: @Gurthang1337 of course it is yes
[3:32:58] nephosen: Offhand dmg doesnt matter and they are faster so u procc the enchnt a little more often
[3:32:58] Excelution: why dont they pull right first and move left so they can finish at the doorway?
[3:32:59] Gurthang117: and not just by a tiny bit its massively ahead
[3:32:59] Morningst4R: @Gurthang1337 I think prot pallies do more single target, their CDs are big
[3:33:12] N3x3z: u can, but most rogues in mdi didnt used it in off Hand, thats why im wondering that all 4 rogues now Play it
[3:33:27] slaq0r: better stats
[3:33:29] Gurthang117: nah look at the war pumping 20k ST
[3:33:30] Achw3l: man these comps are really diverse and varied
[3:34:05] Sleepypan: man these chat comments are really diverse and varied
[3:34:11] Gurthang117: the only reason pallies are not on par with war is cause their damage is bad
[3:34:11] Trohuz: prot pally can do a lot of ST but they have to pick certain traits which you don't want considering the rest of the dungeon
[3:34:18] 1911smoke: never going to be diverse, something will always be best, and thats what everyone will play

[3:34:26] Moobot: Mouse over the inspect tool on your screen to find out what gear and talent the teams are using. Tooltips powered by Wowhead!
[3:34:27] Liryns: offhand damage matters, but you can use a dagger/sword/fist in OH as outlaw as combat potency is normalized.
[3:34:39] Morningst4R: @Gurthang1337 their AOE is definitely bad, looks like warrior is still a bit ahead overall ST as well
[3:34:40] Trohuz: their dmg isn't bad lol, warrior is just broken
[3:34:44] RopeDrink: Their damage is fine - it's just not CappaClap level.
[3:34:50] boris_u: @fortehnguyen the nerf is 50% cut from the 100% bonus thunderclap damage in avatar with a chosen talent, not straight up 50% dmg cut on clap

[3:36:18] RopeDrink: The difference is PPal does not need CD's for solid AoE damage, whereas War needs AvaBoom to make those phat numbers. With the nerf it'll normalize a bit.
[3:36:19] JoetatoGB: id rather see warr destroy the dmg meter than a dk top the healing meter tbh

[5:26:20] MisterRoya: MoP dungeons werent that bad tbh
[5:26:33] Kajind: m+ in legion was great
[5:26:49] Kajind: raids were awesome also
[5:26:52] Trohuz: @varys_ow oh, yea i can get behind that, i really dislike the amount and the types of rng right now in the game :(
[5:26:56] MrRockMeAwsome: it always the same comp
[5:27:11] Warcraft_Whims: I liked WoD because I could purchase tokens for 22K but when it hit 40K I started thinking, ohh that's a bit too expensive, lol ohh the good old token days
[5:27:12] MisterRoya: Legion was my final expansion for my WoW career xD
[5:27:19] AndweDruid: oh good! two different comps, i'm excited to see this
[5:27:22] varys_ow: apart from that, they removed challengemode. +15 dungeons don't even feel special. @Trohuz yea, right? it's depressing
[5:27:46] thomasaugustto: Legion MDI had repetitive comps too
[5:27:53] Goggetta: MoP and WoD just didn't add any dungeon content throughout the expansion, plus tehre was no m+ system to keep everything relevant. Dungeon content died out within 4 weeks of expansion launch (except for the one run of gold timer runs)
[5:27:56] Warcraft_Whims: Nostaglia will kill the new Classic, people always remember things being better than what they were
[5:27:58] MisterRoya: Nah Classic gave us old folk the grind we miss lol
[5:28:03] Kingkeane: Classic is trash the only thing good about it was the class quests/legendary quests and the community
[5:28:05] AndweDruid: two new comps with new races, love it.
[5:28:05] Anadorii: lots of players that didn't play vanilla at release are going to struggle with it. much slower paced game.
[5:28:28] pizzagod: aahahahaha
[5:28:30] Trohuz: challenge modes were nice, it's disappointing they didn't already add some actual rewards to the m+ achievements

[5:29:55] tlhgamer: @Trohuz @varys_ow Agreed.

[5:41:10] Seletara: Nagura is fine. Certainly not nearly as bad as MNF casters
[5:41:11] Rainpuddle: @SmellyStrobes No idea, she's technical and has insight. I like her.

[5:42:08] myamoray: oops meant @bishop_gilchrist
[5:42:12] Archilles_lol: not as much from what ive seen. I think its just experience though, she has potential
[5:42:12] Shadowya: Kappa
[5:42:15] Vattss: We got a white knight here
[5:42:19] thomasaugustto: @bishop_gilchrist gn!
[5:42:19] Schlangan: isn't there only one ?
[5:42:28] Jaftica: She needs to back off speaking on and on..4 casters and she speaks over 50% of the time
[5:42:30] dopeboislim: shes so fine
[5:42:34] jwhomp: a few white knights
[5:42:35] xxSayden: wait naguura isnt even casting this round and ppl talking bad about her? I just tuned in. Wowza
[5:42:46] Rainpuddle: What's wrong with white knights?
[5:42:46] thomasaugustto: @sweetdemise123 no that's Jak
[5:42:47] Dante20404: she is great streamer and a good wow player but as a caster she is really bad man idk why people get butthurt about that
[5:42:50] B4GGZ: @scriptix who won BM or nerf
[5:42:52] Jaftica: thinnk that is why some don't care for her
[5:42:53] devineclaus: thinking nagura is ok, makes you a white knight?
[5:42:53] Flank_King: @xxSayden same
[5:42:58] liketheflower: people talking like their caster preferences have any amount of objectivity lol, who cares if people like nagura or not
[5:42:58] redlambsrose: nagurra is good. She knows her stuff
[5:42:58] Schlangan: dunno for legion it was rich who was trashtalked
[5:43:09] sweetdemise123: did jack transition to female? didnt know my bad
[5:43:18] devineclaus: right, I like rich also, so

[5:43:29] thomasaugustto: yea
[5:43:31] breakingthecode: ohhhh look 1 prot warrior, 1 resto druid, 2 rogues and a melee dps thank you blizzard for the great comps
[5:43:33] Khrom117: calling someone a white knight is just a way to try and quiet someone speaking up for another
[5:43:41] Dante20404: yes she does know her stuff but that DOESN'T MAKE HER A GOOD CASTER
[5:43:51] Khrom117: its a form of peer pressure. you can call me a white knight all you want
[5:44:00] philx: hey anyone a jdotbabe @gurzen
[5:44:06] tangentbords_krigaren: as if it would be a bad thing being a white knight
[5:44:08] Rainpuddle: @Khrom117 I agree.
[5:44:16] Ascient: if you think naguura is a bad caster you've never experienced actual bad casting :)
[5:44:18] myamoray: @Dante20404 what does then, in your opinion?
[5:44:20] xxSayden: jdotbBabe
[5:44:20] redlambsrose: know- casting makes her a good caster. Dont see you doing it
[5:44:22] ogliluzismurf: u guys would not do better than her so shut it up
[5:44:23] tangentbords_krigaren: People are just moron's :D
[5:44:24] Jaftica: still have not heard what makes her a bad caster
[5:44:36] Hadshotwhopper: I think she is the only good caster today
[5:44:50] Seletara: I miss xyronic
[5:44:55] Skutta_Dubs: if this comp was pvp what would it be seeing that its monk r , r, d , w
[5:44:58] drooiidd: i enjoy the diversity of the casters
[5:45:00] thomasaugustto: 1 min no deaths? BM best performance ic!
[5:45:01] varys_ow: imagine being a white knight D:
[5:45:02] Schlangan: tbh there is not much to cast in dungeons anyways ^^
[5:45:03] Khrom117: @failedacress what part of what i said is "an excuse"?
[5:45:05] redlambsrose: sloot is the best- she's a close second
[5:45:10] Dante20404: like i said i like her as a streamer and yes she knows her stuff but man as a caster she blows she should know it she is pretty boring and she just say the same things over and over
[5:45:13] tangentbords_krigaren: yea an oppinion in twtich chat doesnt make her a bad caster or make it a fact
[5:45:14] Mozima: any jdotbabes in the chat @philsan_
[5:45:21] Archilles_lol: It gets explained alot, read the chat @jaftica
[5:45:21] myamoray: I think they're all doing a great job! I appreciate this MDI because of the casting
[5:45:28] devineclaus: she trys her best, sas all the casters do.
[5:45:28] Kerpxd: @i_am_tazy cmonBruh
[5:45:29] sweetdemise123: rich is the best but he got fired for not being pc enough FBM
[5:45:35] devineclaus: nothing wrong with that
[5:45:41] Khrom117: @myamoray i agree
[5:45:42] tangentbords_krigaren: @Dante20404 So does the male casters
[5:45:43] jwhomp: am I not allowed to dislike someone?
[5:45:50] devineclaus: @sweetdemise123 he got fired?

[5:46:16] sweetdemise123: @devineclaus thats what was said so unless it was a bad joke i think so
[5:46:19] Jaftica: @Archilles_lol ty will do
[5:46:23] Rainpuddle: @jwhomp it just seems like the default action for most people
[5:46:23] drooiidd: sloot is great, his darkheart puns always leaf me speechless
[5:46:26] Dante20404: @myamoray dude yes they are doing a great job but i know they are the best they can i agree but when someone is not good at something is not a bad thing to point it out or its? i mean im not trying to be rude
[5:46:26] stradiater: Better than the ESL casters for Starcraft besides Tastosis combo
[5:46:26] Moobot: Today's casters are Daniel "AutomaticJak" Anzenberger, Ted "Sloot" Bacinschi, Caroline "Naguura" Forer, Aaron "Sours" Shaffer, and Peyton "Tettles" Tettleton
[5:46:41] jwhomp: hahaha
[5:46:49] mustbeTrypsin: @drooiidd sloot needs new puns for these new dungeons
[5:46:55] Khrom117: they all say the same thing. there are only so many maps. if you watch the entire MDI you are going to hear them repeat the same info
[5:46:56] tehaliii: @jwhomp you are allowed to dislike someone. But most of the hate she gets is veiled sexism
[5:47:00] myamoray: @Dante20404 it's okay sister
[5:47:04] eggman_br: ok chat rejoice i have returned
[5:47:08] drooiidd: agreed!
[5:47:10] varys_ow: ALL WOMEN ARE QUEENS
[5:47:28] sweetdemise123: sloot and rich came up with all the puns, its no surprise he now needs new ones seeing as 1/2 the pun team is missing
[5:47:33] tangentbords_krigaren: Nah some are actually peasants
[5:47:34] eggman_br: some are princesses, surely
[5:47:49] jwhomp: @vethyra says who?
[5:48:03] varys_ow: white knight intensifies
[5:48:09] Archilles_lol: From what Ive seen most of the "hate" is constructive, and they are labeled as sexist. Nice
[5:48:09] myamoray: just don't add Drama before the Queen and we'll forgive you!
[5:48:13] Schlangan: well rich was bad anyways so it's nice to have him finally away (he was not made for mdis, he should take care of arenas only)
[5:48:19] checkemcharles: @Vethyra kepp this stupid stuff out of chat
[5:48:24] Ascient: im confident if you call other people white knights there is something wrong with you
[5:48:53] Tydo420: so lame
[5:49:01] thomasaugustto: @AutomaticJak please flush the chat ty
[5:49:04] devineclaus: @failedacress thats because of salt.
[5:49:14] Mestrah22: !uptime
[5:49:18] tangentbords_krigaren: Sloot is a color caster, Sours is the analytical caster, Jack is the desk lead and so on.. they all ahve predesignated roles in their caster roles.. there is reason tehy all are differnet and hirded as such.. but people dont understand those things..
[5:49:20] xxSayden: @failedacress Maybe when he's actively casting. She isn't even on. And hasn't been for how long? And you're still whining about her?
[5:49:25] varys_ow: so it's gucci to dislike a male caster but if it's a girl it's sexism? LuL
[5:49:26] Schlangan: humans need enough sodium intake per day :p
[5:49:30] sweetdemise123: @Schlangan rich was most often the HOST. his job was to make convo and ask dumb questions (ie questions some in chat may want to know) now the caster just recite the tactics on repeat. blizz should just hire a bot
[5:49:36] eggman_br: Sloot is a WHAT
[5:49:37] jwhomp: @ascient how so?
[5:50:01] varys_ow: @jwhomp because all women are queens :)
[5:50:03] thr0mbin: wong does so much damage
[5:50:05] AutomaticJak: Hey chat let‚Äôs :)
[5:50:08] AudigyTV: Lol

[5:50:20] Archilles_lol: no :)
[5:50:21] RichardPPPan: :)
[5:50:25] drooiidd: it does get a little old to hear the dungeon mechanics every dungeon. not that I know how to do it any better though.
[5:50:31] eggman_br: well @HeyItsWags you may say hes doing something wight then :)
[5:50:31] Ellisnacks: :)
[5:50:33] thomasaugustto: :)
[5:50:33] myamoray: doing a great job @AutomaticJak
[5:50:35] AudigyTV: U can‚Äôt say the word naguura

[5:50:50] ivan_jerkov: nagura is good :)
[5:50:56] varys_ow: ^
[5:51:04] thomasaugustto: jakbNICE
[5:51:06] sweetdemise123: @drooiidd you say that but we have seen it done better. last mdi for example
[5:51:06] varys_ow: @jwhomp THATS SEXISM HOW DARE U
[5:51:07] xxSayden: @failedacress no need to be mad :)
[5:51:09] AudigyTV: Message deleted
[5:51:12] AutomaticJak: We all definitely have more to improve on @drooiidd and that‚Äôs fair critique
[5:51:20] devineclaus: ^

[5:51:52] myamoray: If we come back to watch this because of the casting desk, then you must be doing something very right! @AutomaticJak
[5:52:09] AutomaticJak: Many ppl know basic mechanics but some things like Shrine last boss debuff I always see someone in chat ask abt healer dmg so that‚Äôs a good point for casters to talk abt
[5:52:16] devineclaus: @AutomaticJak not really, I mean its the same dungeons and the same comps each time.
[5:52:18] Ochronosis: I just enjoy the stream and community overall :)
[5:52:30] ribe1212: ! bracket
[5:52:32] thomasaugustto: you could also talk about Y NO SNEK DUNGEON PunOko
[5:52:41] Ascient: @jwhomp if i went into my reasoning i'd get banned :)
[5:52:44] myamoray: Group HUG!
[5:52:44] AutomaticJak: Just finding the right balance between what is well known and what isn‚Äôt :)
[5:52:50] ub3rchad: ah yes temple of snek
[5:52:51] AudigyTV: Yea the casters def make it fun
[5:52:55] eggman_br: no one complains that the soccer team always plays on the same fields and all use goallies that use their hands
[5:52:55] sweetdemise123: @AutomaticJak this is twitch chat, 90% of the time the dumb question is a troll. like lol healer top dmg LUL dead game LUL.

[5:53:11] TeamAlibi: any competitive pve in any game is gonna have repetitive comps and whatnot
[5:53:17] drooiidd: that's true, but you have to remember that everyone in chat knows everything already! lol
[5:53:26] Schlangan: well the tchat ended up by getting the heal meter so who knows ^^
[5:53:34] Geist1337: sodaC
[5:53:39] devineclaus: also your helping those that dont know the mechanics become informed. its kinda your job to inform and talk, you all are doing a good job, almost as good as preach at method race LUL
[5:53:39] Ochronosis: :)
[5:53:41] Archilles_lol: @automaticjak People will always be more vocal about things being bad, so if people dont mention it its a great success? Kappa
[5:53:43] SmellyStrobes: @TeamAlibi To be repetitive to THIS DEGREE, though, is just terrible balance.
[5:53:44] AudigyTV: Not in heroes of the storm @teamalibi
[5:53:49] mustbeTrypsin: @AutomaticJak it gets mentioned during the casts but only rarely, what about talking a bit more about player performances like comparing dps and hps on bosses and so on. It only ever gets brought up when theres like the 1m dps pull. That's something that will always be different from one run to another and leads to discussing player proficiency on the class they are playing since its always the same comps
[5:53:50] ogliluzismurf: they should have guilds compete against each other instead of pros
[5:53:52] Landyy: ive joined pugs that wipe on the first boss repeatedly and disband from +2- to +10, its not a bad thing that they give tips
[5:54:07] recklectic: class diversity buff in m+, discuss
[5:54:14] jwhomp: @ascient word it in a way you wont, or can you not?
[5:54:19] Trohuz: preach at method's wf race was godsent Kreygasm so good
[5:54:20] AudigyTV: Next MDI they should make it 1 class per team
[5:54:21] Schlangan: vulperins are nice
[5:54:27] AutomaticJak: Could do @mustbetrypsin
[5:54:32] AudigyTV: No double nonsense
[5:54:32] Ochronosis: 5 druids :)
[5:54:39] Ench31: Casters aren't explaining for people who know the dungeon or affixes, they're describing for the new people who don't
[5:54:40] Archilles_lol: I have joined 15 Sneks where the prot doesnt know he can Spell Reflect first boss NotLikeThis
[5:54:44] devineclaus: 5 pallys
[5:54:50] drooiidd: i'm still stoked we got to see a shadow priest/bm hunter, however briefly it was
[5:54:52] legionkcs: @landyy i havent seen pugs disband because of the first boss sub+10 in a while
[5:55:01] mustbeTrypsin: @AutomaticJak it's something i noticed was missing when compared to other esports and conventional sports. Personal player performance
[5:55:07] Tholen86: i like hearing the mechanics
[5:55:10] Ench31: So they need to re-explain every cast
[5:55:13] sweetdemise123: @AutomaticJak not a flame i enjoy your hosting BUT theres a difference between this mdi and last. theres a lack of jokes, flames, back story about players, drama etc. again not a flame but maybe its blizzard who doesnt want all that but thats what made it really fun to watch last time
[5:55:19] Rostan: When are they gonna do the RP MDI?
[5:55:27] Landyy: @Leg1on_tv its mostly just tank fial
[5:55:31] Landyy: fail*
[5:55:43] AutomaticJak: Fair feedback. There‚Äôs ongoing discussions of UI improvements to help casters and chat @mustbetrypsin :)
[5:55:44] ogliluzismurf: or bans like in other esports to level the field
[5:55:46] recklectic: moar RP
[5:55:47] jwhomp: @rostan I cant wait!
[5:55:48] devineclaus: doing your job is not a bad thing @AutomaticJak
[5:55:56] eggman_br: i dont mind mirror comps, but they should veto two players with same class in team. Its reasonable compromise
[5:55:57] thomasaugustto: bosses should come back as reaping mobs too LUL
[5:55:59] Nzfox: would like a competition where they can't use the same character for more than one run and have to swap between alts..would make comps interesting
[5:55:59] TSMballer: whats the rogue specs anyone know?
[5:56:03] aevhri: I want to see disc priests in MDI wraxuHmm
[5:56:16] Emose: outlaw

[5:56:24] Skutta_Dubs: neck n neck
[5:56:25] varys_ow: @TSMballer outlaw
[5:56:29] eggman_br: or let players play whatever and just paint unit frames with different colors, twitch chat will never notice it
[5:56:29] Moobot: More info about the MDI Program can be found at the WoW Esports website! https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/mythic
[5:56:32] frozenmystsl: lul
[5:56:38] Nyctereutes: disc priest got hard nerfed, meanwhile resto druid
[5:56:38] sirhyl: I remember the first MDI with a team that didnt even have a healer
[5:56:45] drooiidd: it would make comps more interesting but it could really affect their performance
[5:56:47] Archilles_lol: Gimme more BM SMOrc
[5:56:48] mustbeTrypsin: @AutomaticJak that's good to hear. Last MDI in legion there was more class differences like the mages and what have you. This MDI has to be rough on the casters which is understandable
[5:56:52] AutomaticJak: That‚Äôs possible @sweetdemise123 . We don‚Äôt know east very well compared to west so that‚Äôs another factor in joking abt player performance and banter. MDI should always be fun tho
[5:56:59] sweetdemise123: that was 2nd mdi team without healer btw
[5:57:04] Skutta_Dubs: clicin the pig is such a task
[5:57:10] TSMballer: so the meta is double outlaw? BF that strong of cleave right now?
[5:57:11] Dumpsterr: disc priest keeps getting nerfed cuz the top .01% is too good at it NotLikeThis
[5:57:27] Khrom117: @aevhri what do disc priests offer that would replace the Rdruid?
[5:57:31] eggman_br: priest tank confirmed!
[5:57:32] Toyzwa: is the blood censored to oil ?
[5:57:35] AutomaticJak: Depends on who you ask @devineclaus Kappa
[5:57:41] Landyy: @failedacress how
[5:57:43] Ascient: @jwhomp because its essentially just an insult, except it also leads people to think ur sexist, so what is the point in saying it? You may as well just hold a sign saying im sexist :)
[5:57:46] Nyctereutes: 50% of rogue dmg is just pressing BF button and AA @TSMballer LuL
[5:57:50] ogliluzismurf: next mdi will be all druid teams lol
[5:57:55] zaanmage: @automaticjak We definitely need an energy bar on mobs/bossrs where it is relevant. Last boss in UR being the biggest offender
[5:57:59] ogliluzismurf: 5 druids
[5:58:06] nekkrage: why are the blood pools gray????
[5:58:18] Ascient: @jwhomp why not just insult people normally by calling them dumb or something
[5:58:24] nuckAU: @Toyzwa Yep, even undead show no bones, the chinese version is censored
[5:58:25] eggman_br: China client

[6:14:21] Unholycookie: @Naguura you madddd? when I heard "oh its a lower kara", I just logged off went outside
[6:14:22] bathroombuddy11: @Naguura ive heard its undertuned though, id be dissapointed if it ended up being super easy
[6:14:23] ashix_xoxo: remember legion when everything wasnt F
[6:14:29] AutomaticJak: But we‚Äôre wholesome @jaftica :)
[6:14:29] bathroombuddy11: at least day 1
[6:14:37] tylive52: @naguura not to discredit the skill cap of any competitors I just feel the meta has become to much META>SKILL
[6:14:46] mr_jimbone: think Team D took that skip from Musclebrah
[6:14:54] OoopsMyBadBro: hey guys. new streamer, follow me if you like!

[6:15:18] Unholycookie: @tylive52 a part sure, but no randomss without skill can do such pulls like some of these team and do it well
[6:15:20] Naguura: @cronox94 thank you! always trying to improve
[6:15:20] Teitanblood: double rogue as always ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[6:15:34] mr_jimbone: yeah he is a great streamer
[6:15:54] MOXP: rogue nerfed to death in 8.2
[6:16:13] Narisko: @mytras hope so Pog
[6:16:16] SmellyStrobes: @mytras good
[6:16:18] Teitanblood: need bigger nerf that that. Its just a trait nerf
[6:16:23] Teitanblood: than*
[6:16:24] ashix_xoxo: @Jimbone87 nice joke
[6:16:38] Stragic: strange, I would've expected 3 enhancement shamans
[6:16:38] tylive52: @unholycookie I definitely dont doubt that! these people are at skill camp and it's great would just like to see more classes able to even put their name in the hat, know what I mean?
[6:16:40] lofibanshee: "Just a trait nerf" LUL
[6:16:46] mr_jimbone: =)
[6:16:48] MOXP: @Teitanblood then you have no clue :)
[6:16:56] AudigyTV: Next patch is prot pally time
[6:16:57] Moobot: Welcome to Spring Season of the Mythic Dungeon International. Learn what's on tap for this season at https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22945352/viewer-s-guide-mythic-dungeon-international-spring-season
[6:17:02] Huramai: rogues would needc a huge nerf to make them so bad the utility is no longer worth having one
[6:17:04] AudigyTV: Or dh or bear
[6:17:10] Teitanblood: it is a trait... More nerfs pls <3
[6:17:11] Jaftica: ludicrously>?
[6:17:16] AudigyTV: Hopefully prot pally
[6:17:32] lofibanshee: You could never nerf rogues enough to remove them from the meta
[6:17:37] Unholycookie: @tylive52 amen to that. Hey, until a week ago I played a vengeance dh till 2.6k score.. I swaped to a warrior bcs its too weak to handle fortify
[6:17:44] iceolater89: @audigytv how come?
[6:18:09] wy6ix: i hate when they nerf DK
[6:18:15] Darkminded: nerf shroud...bye rogues
[6:18:21] Trohuz: that's the thing, rogue utility is still so big, they'll remain meta .. @Banshee_GG this
[6:18:23] PanickyPuppy: prot pally is fun to watch imo
[6:18:27] tylive52: @unholycookie yes not hating on the players it's just not the game I fell in love with anymore
[6:18:29] Huramai: resto druids need more buffs though :P
[6:18:41] AudigyTV: Well 1 I play prot pally, 2 they are mad nice 3 they have a lot of utility
[6:18:46] Teitanblood: remove shroud pls
[6:18:46] spac3duck: there should be a map in the final rounds where after each boss theres a new set of random afflixes
[6:18:56] Khrom117: I feel the only way you will see different comps is limiting the number of times you can use a specific class/roll. but then you would see the same comps for certain dungeons
[6:18:59] AudigyTV: 4 are a lot of fun imo
[6:19:10] Yungbtw: nerf the cannons
[6:19:10] xxSayden: Resto could use a Vanish
[6:19:30] tylive52: and chat I understand there will always be a meta, but this one just seems like blizz doesnt care
[6:19:32] Nyctereutes: resto isn't op - all healers in MDI - resto, 80% of healers in arenas - resto LuL
[6:19:39] Unholycookie: @tylive52 legion tanking was stupid tho. 1 touch and they almost never lost aggro and also you could pull huge without nearly as many worries and survive np
[6:20:02] rumers94: pve ResidentSleeper
[6:20:17] ashix_xoxo: resto has the most healing output while being the most mana efficient healer and ppl say its not op
[6:20:17] AudigyTV: I prefer mw vs druid
[6:20:24] Ochronosis: Oh no :3
[6:20:30] vexha_07: NotLikeThis
[6:20:32] Jadax2: ruh roh raggy
[6:20:38] sweetdemise123: @Unholycookie made it fun to play and watch, i remeber doing crazy pulls in lower after seeing it in the mdi, insane fun.
[6:20:38] thomasaugustto: F
[6:20:39] Huramai: if it was that much of a difference there would be more DKs instead of windwalker or double rogue
[6:20:46] tylive52: @unholycookie yeah that's true legion has it's fair share of problems but there was more nuance to legion than this imho
[6:20:49] Paulzini: Just give brez to all healer
[6:20:53] vexha_07: FailFish FailFish FailFish
[6:21:08] irontummy1: clownfiesta confirmed
[6:21:16] lofibanshee: @tylive52 they do care, they're just committed to not doing changes during a season
[6:21:22] Emose: give brez back to hunters!!!!
[6:21:23] Naguura: huuuuge pull by black mamba PoChamp look at that % in 1 pull
[6:21:27] tylive52: @unholycookie we cant even gear switch while in the dungeon anymore I miss that so much switching legos and trinks on the go
[6:21:34] xxSayden: Black Mamba just did work
[6:21:44] It_is_Josh: nice PogChamp naguura
[6:21:52] Paulzini: Brez healer only
[6:21:54] v2_Rootz: Vahleeree
[6:21:56] PrimerinoTV: i miss challenge modes
[6:21:56] tylive52: @banshee_gg yet they buffed sub rogue for pvp right before the tourney right?
[6:21:57] Stragic: I feel like some of the comp issues could be solved by forcing each player to only be allowed to play a class once per match.

[7:15:02] dawsonator171: @ogreranger becuase its about speed running.
[7:15:07] pazeeh: wasnt as bad
[7:15:11] Innkkeeper: were all teh anz teams banned or something?
[7:15:12] Trollulol: blizzard is just a small indie team working on a free to play mmo, they have to update the micro transaction store often to not go under, please stop criticizing, they're trying hard :)

[7:16:53] AudigyTV: @trollulol blizzard is not a small indie company I‚Äôve seen their HQ
[7:16:55] Trollulol: the game is too unbalanced to allow a point system
[7:17:03] Ben_: battle royale esports NotLikeThis
[7:17:22] xAzzaaah6: @dashu16 give teams a second chance. They end up all getting points anyways to see who qualifies for global
[7:17:26] politimi_72: To those who hate on BFA by saying the "same comp" joke, you totally forgot the Legion MDI's. Players back then used copy-paste comps aswell
[7:17:26] Vindiski: still better than WoW arena esports
[7:17:28] MystiqueTia: You're a bigger man than me Dawsonator171, she's obnoxios as everything

[7:19:15] sparklifegaming: @Evolutes im ashamed to say that i loled a bit at that.
[7:19:18] politimi_72: They use the meta, they want to win. In normal situation noone force you to run the same comp, especially if you play with friends
[7:19:20] AudigyTV: Are they just gonna relaunch the old games starting at classic
[7:19:21] Bakedcity: is there a way to find the main toons of those players right now?
