[1:03:58] D3KHAR: Hoping for it
[1:04:19] matuzgotv: Resto shaman with Riptide will be the best healer in p2 mark my words.
[1:04:24] GamerGierr: Travel form is gonna be huge for resto
[1:06:06] D3KHAR: Are you going to look at mage healer?
[1:06:19] Distorpia: i wish they'd delete mage healer from the game

[1:16:34] Distorpia: mass dispel would be busted for horde no ?
[1:17:27] Distorpia: yeah shadowfiend for sure
[1:17:58] KcolraWertex: pretty ass for alliance priests
[1:17:59] Angelwrath240: what about some form o version of dark archangel? with some passive mana regen maybe?
[1:18:04] ControversyTV: as ally player i have no prob iwth bubble
[1:18:10] Sinostra: block will also be in the game
[1:18:52] weeedzygg: no way they do dispersion priest would be completely broken
[1:19:11] kzeelol: are you using 3.5 mm or usb on your blue yeti? it sounds so good
[1:19:20] Distorpia: watch them add something useless like hymn of hope or something
[1:20:14] thecornmaster: rapture?
[1:20:18] Moonfirebeam: 202 raiders from Moonfirebeam have joined! 
[1:20:28] Distorpia: atonement is basically arcane mage LUL
[1:20:29] motod0x: leap of faith
[1:20:47] thecornmaster: rapture is cool but being reduced ot shield spam is kinda sad
[1:20:48] dfoxzz: yo whats up
[1:21:55] hypreeeeeeeee: hopefully they would more new stuff never seen before, or scrapped projects. try making racial specific stuff more powerful?
[1:22:33] TrebekTv: and ofc adding racial shrines to swap priest abilities would be nice
[1:22:46] Toxiferous: light form?
[1:22:46] oornli1992: !runes
[1:22:46] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[1:22:54] hypreeeeeeeee: as long as its not atonement, im down for that
[1:23:00] thecornmaster: we would need crusader judge on horde though :c
[1:23:03] Toxiferous: never heard of it
[1:23:24] bluntsamurai98: lightwell could be any target is healed that is sub 50%
[1:24:03] hypreeeeeeeee: holy word serenity would be nice, the chakra system. refreshing renews via direct heals
[1:24:05] Kroovy: I would like to see them add the addendum to Twisted Faith that Mind Flay and Mind Blast cast on a target affected by SW:P take 50% increased damage from them - and also they cost no mana
[1:24:17] Kroovy: make you choose between void plague and sustain for long term
[1:24:22] thecornmaster: purge the wicked in holy form
[1:24:24] Extramediums: imagine priest with no mana cost dps skills
[1:24:37] D3KHAR: I want to suck people like warlocks
[1:24:45] hypreeeeeeeee: Mindblast in p2 will be absolute bonkers with that
[1:25:14] Extramediums: could embrace the hybrid style like boomkin
[1:25:18] 31yearoldjunksee: omfg they fucken beter not make smite priest over shadow dps
[1:25:58] 31yearoldjunksee: Man spriest got shafted so hard p1, we better be gods p2 lol
[1:26:01] bluntsamurai98: i cant wait for the tournament havent really dont many before so thats gonna be fun!
[1:26:07] bluntsamurai98: done*
[1:26:21] TrebekTv: some kind of blinding light fear disorient in holy form, where you cant cast your normal fear would be neat
[1:26:25] Sinostra: wouldn't adding more slows/roots also count as speed creeping ?
[1:26:36] Sinostra: mobility
[1:26:37] Sinostra: sorry
[1:26:47] notJumu: no penance in shadowform and no CoS in pve rip the unkillable pumper dream
[1:27:23] Extramediums: atonement seriously pissed me off when they did legion changes
[1:27:25] bluntsamurai98: wasnt silence for priest in tbc a proc chance instead of a personal on use cd
[1:27:29] oornli1992: what about homunculus less spawn time, but with the effects of Shadowfiend @Hydramist ??
[1:27:57] SouixLive: are the new runes leaked?
[1:28:06] thecornmaster: rly dont like if they focus on homies, wont they be destroyed by oil of imo?
[1:28:20] oornli1992: true
[1:28:26] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[1:28:27] bluntsamurai98: it is super annoying when you spawn the homies in combat and they come out with half health
[1:28:59] Extramediums: make priest a pet class: Homies, Shadow fiend, Mind bender and the void summons from capstone spriest df talents /s :D
[1:29:01] hypreeeeeeeee: or they just afk like shadowy apparitions before fixing that in cata
[1:29:09] oornli1992: or aoe
[1:29:10] Sinostra: at first i thought you'd do warsongs on alliance
[1:29:26] kzeelol: maybe homies will get more hp with level increase?
[1:29:30] bluntsamurai98: imagine shadow fiend becomes like a spell shadow priest can learna as a perma pet haha
[1:29:33] thecornmaster: a nade plus oil, I think they are gonna be super fragile in p2 while in p1 there arent many ways to deal with them.
[1:31:05] thecornmaster: thecornmaster subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:31:27] cunderthuntz_: do you think they will add runes for existing slots or new slots?
[1:31:34] cunderthuntz_: head shoulders etc
[1:31:44] thecornmaster: think they mentioned new slots
[1:32:09] bluntsamurai98: i think head slot and a shoulder slot will be 60 phase
[1:32:10] aemoL: what have you done to your background?!
[1:33:07] rns_aurelius: i think some existing runes should be moved when the new slots are available

[1:34:01] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o1HC3zbP4H8
[1:34:14] Extramediums: I kinda feel like having the runes acquisition method from p1 stay the same (but like you're saying, adjust what armor piece they're on) will help keep old world materials/grinds relevant to every one
[1:35:10] hntb100: isnt reniew really bad to cast?
[1:35:42] Extramediums: r1 for pom bouncing
[1:36:16] bluntsamurai98: what is that addon for your spells?
[1:36:31] bluntsamurai98: the one that shows healing
[1:36:33] Sinostra: poms are going crazy
[1:36:43] bluntsamurai98: amount
[1:37:01] Extramediums: apparently details can show it in a streamer mode as well
[1:37:07] Extramediums: not sure if it's in the sod version or not
[1:38:54] GamerGierr: Is this tier list specific to world PvP or does did you consider duels, BGs, etc. too?
[1:38:58] Allstarplayabro: Which class/spec do you feel is actually going to come out the gates of phase 2 and be like hunters where when SOD released, and just destroy everything?

[1:39:55] Sinostra: and mana
[1:40:32] Sinostra: who knows ? it's been fixed in later versions
[1:40:33] rns_aurelius: things like the dog from the whistle and battle chicken dont though
[1:40:57] KcolraWertex: i think they spawn without the scaling and then get buffed by the player stats

[2:11:08] rns_aurelius: @alexbilbaoo people are more concerned about the reward than actually playing the game
[2:12:51] hagbulbia: hydra can u link the music set u playing
[2:13:24] nikojej: i did the unthinkable. Only played WoW in classic, wanted to test disc arenas. Kinda enjoying the solo shuffle after wotlk Kappa

[2:25:51] Sinostra: yeah, but when you stomp the other team, it's not very interesting, is it ?
[2:26:51] peeweeherman69: is the premade vs premade thing out yet
[2:27:32] MisguidedPingu: daggers of darkness good old times hydra.
[2:27:42] Sinostra: what do you prefer between having randies and being ful premade and stomping ?
[2:27:53] MisguidedPingu: Zadrana Warlock

[2:39:49] TrebekTv: elys use to make horde teams pump, esp with pi priests. lava burst going to be interesting to see in the mix

[2:52:40] Sinostra: and that's why arenas are the best form of pvp, you get to pick your mates
[2:53:01] Porneaux: you can pick your mates for wsg aswell
[2:53:03] skyforce2k13: you can also not play BG's solo though

[3:24:06] jxnxthxn05: Prayge epic dagger/1hander
[3:24:09] Locky987: pugs most of the time just give up if they see semi premade
[3:24:17] Mystylerocks: staff of jordan is 36 so no way + whatever comes from gnome
[3:24:42] jxnxthxn05: dagger and then mutilate, its insane right now but with a god weapon
[3:24:45] peeweeherman69: cant be much better items or be better than lvl 60 raid items soon
[3:24:48] Sinostra: @Mystylerocks nah, staff of jordan is 26
[3:24:54] Sinostra: unless it's been changed
[3:25:05] Sinostra: staff of jordan is just a worse kelris staff
[3:25:07] Alephmempe: #LONGLIVESIMPLY
[3:25:11] jujujay_myalias: The giving up mentality is drivinng me crazy.  Pugs give up before the gates even open -.-
[3:26:01] Mystylerocks: @Sinostra you re right actually, my mind deceived me :p. its lvl 35 though
[3:26:02] buggy_k: thats on premades not pugs
[3:26:03] Cupz21: rune over pearl bis?
[3:26:29] Sinostra: @Mystylerocks yeah
[3:26:39] buggy_k: that mentality was all over classic as well
[3:26:46] Sinostra: that's what makes it even more infuriating
[3:27:22] TrebekTv: i recall in tbc prepatch people on na were spamming trade looking for Losemades, quick give up marks.. it was sad lol
[3:28:16] peeweeherman69: wealdstone raider just got backhandered
[3:28:23] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[3:28:57] buggy_k: its a problem with the way we min max the old version of a game where nothing matters but the end result and is a big reason why wow has gone so wrong imo
[3:29:04] Gallowxyz: I imagine the raider to be a hard carry in WSG
[3:29:05] ilikegoldfishes: is hydra still completely anti-cata?
[3:29:11] Alephmempe: #PALZ4LIFE
[3:30:04] buggy_k: aka warmane for wotlk and how it affected wotlk classic
[3:30:49] jujujay_myalias: Yeah I mean people clearly don't wanna play the game unless it's a guaranteed win. No playing the game because it's fun to play it seems
[3:31:18] buggy_k: ya you basically got it, everyone wants to be at the "top"
[3:31:37] buggy_k: thats why poeple script so much in arena these days

[3:41:29] buggy_k: spirit tap or wand spec
[3:41:33] buggy_k: not sure

[3:42:56] Gallowxyz: The other day you were running from a priest in Duskwood and dispelling plague but not pain, was that to avoid provoking a recast and possible blackout, or just not worth the mana for the damage it does to you?
[3:44:38] hashtagstronger: sorry if its asked a lot but what addon displays the mana cost on all abilities? <3
[3:44:48] hashtagstronger: ty <3
[3:44:48] Sinostra: isn't the dispel for the void plague another one ? like cure disease
[3:45:01] Sinostra: does it cost as much as dispel magic ?
[3:45:18] Sinostra: ok
[3:45:30] Sinostra: ty
[3:46:02] don_ben_yo: Bomb wont explode, if you are LoS

[3:46:06] Shad_WW: bc of los
[3:46:15] hashtagstronger: oh damn, TIL. ty chat
[3:46:24] jujujay_myalias: Yeah it doesn't pop if you're in LOS or stunnned / CCed
[3:46:26] buggy_k: once we get cure disease (the tick dispel one) priest mirror will be interesting
[3:46:32] marshalfocal: that's now how it works in wotlk?
[3:46:52] buggy_k: may not be worth spending mana on void if fighting priest
[3:47:13] dereondra: no it wont @buggy_k because you like men
[3:47:26] buggy_k: you got me
[3:47:58] dereondra: buggy im really in a holiday inn express rn lmao

[3:50:36] balance_balance: is this spec viable for bfd
[3:50:59] Drunk_Mantis: noob question: can a blackout stun be resisted independently from the damage that proc'd it?
[3:51:04] jxnxthxn05: LMFAO
[3:51:04] dereondra: they are leaving like 12 dehumidifiers till friday buggy and then i need to get another pc now haha

[3:52:18] jujujay_myalias: I think completing med education makes you at least glad ngl xD
[3:52:21] griffithismydaddy: rather a 1500 heart surgeon than a rank 1 wow player perform surgery on me
[3:52:27] balance_balance: Is this odd healing/shadow spec viable for healing bfd?
[3:52:31] Drunk_Mantis: clutchhhh
[3:52:32] flenbober: highest form of education is a good indicator
[3:52:35] buggy_k: which is complete opposite of what society needs
[3:52:42] Anhov: would a 1500 get thru med school then?
[3:52:49] kitra__: keeps the rating in check :D
[3:53:01] buggy_k: hydra is right
[3:53:32] buggy_k: as an engineer you would be suprised how many engineers finish school not learning a damn thing
[3:53:33] Shad_WW: @buggy_k youd be surprised how dumb some of the people in the classes are
[3:53:35] jujujay_myalias: The current meta is evidence that 90% of people can in fact not to BGs
[3:53:36] Creoxx: the ppl i see with me in vetmed, unbelievable, not sure how they even found the button to queue, let alone get 1200
[3:53:38] balance_balance: Is this odd healing/shadow spec viable for healing bfd?
[3:54:08] hashtagstronger: @balance_balance any spec can heal bfd, just get penance and pom Pog
[3:54:44] marshalfocal: lawyers are the same also. general punter has no idea what is good
[3:54:44] Porneaux: What addon shows enemy buffs?
[3:54:48] buggy_k: i dont understand either
[3:54:55] Shad_WW: i have to call doctors multiple times a week to get medicine doses changes, that would actually kill ppl if not checked
[3:55:02] kitra__: Kings.. queens...
[3:55:19] dereondra: true alot of bullshitters out here
[3:55:30] flenbober: @Shad_WW cant that be due to they being understaffed / lack of resources / bad system or w/e
[3:55:43] marshalfocal: I very much rate the soft sell hydra approach
[3:55:47] flowen001: lol
[3:55:57] Shad_WW: @flenbober not an excuse for killin ppl tho
[3:56:04] dereondra: true Pshero is an american dog
[3:56:10] kitra__: ya mass hype and group hype some streamers in between
[3:56:23] btrflylol: ngl ur 1st pvp videos , were the top. ppl were waiting to see them.
[3:56:27] flenbober: @Shad_WW of course not :) the question is if the individual doctor is to blame or something larger
[3:56:29] buggy_k: im dog shit at selling myslef too and i saw a classmate take my internship one year who i know had no idea of what was going on in class
[3:56:57] Shad_WW: @flenbober 95% of issues are frame the same few ppl
[3:58:12] kitra__: Going to hit the bed,  Wish you all a good night,  Always lovely to be on your stream Hydra, have a good one :)
[3:58:13] GamerGierr: passive lol
[3:58:14] Porneaux: Yo chat, why are the enemy buffs showing? Is it an addon or a setting?
[3:58:17] flenbober: racial passive
[3:58:42] GamerGierr: It's an addon
[3:58:44] TrebekTv: classic aura durations @Porneaux
[3:58:54] buggy_k: it somewhat goes back to what i was saying about wow players, wanting the end result and not actually getting good at the game
[3:59:02] Porneaux: Tyvm
[3:59:06] g_1_t: Cat aggro
[3:59:06] hashtagstronger: @TrebekTv isnt that only for debuffs? I think he means the buffs
[3:59:09] MxKV__: hydraKit
[3:59:12] sleepytempest: whats the best professions for a priest
[3:59:14] dereondra: haha yea charisma itself almost seems to blanket cs most knowledge of a subject
[3:59:19] Fekk0r: Same way Americans call sport things "world series" when it's 90% of the time only Americans playing
[3:59:21] jujujay_myalias: That's just how the world works sadly. Apple don't make the best products but they are the most valuable coompany
[3:59:39] Porneaux: Ye, buffs not debuffs
[3:59:59] TrebekTv: the addon does both, no?
[4:00:38] buggy_k: @dereondra "blanket cs" lmao
[4:02:21] jxnxthxn05: kek
[4:02:28] hashtagstronger: LUL
[4:02:47] flenbober: you gotta work the youtube algo better Kappa
[4:02:51] g_1_t: i think everyone just hears duskwood and assumes your fighting bots KEKW
[4:03:00] googlewooglex: do u have any clue why priest fear sometimes is dispellable and sometimes not?
[4:03:10] rns_aurelius: if people cant understand the nuance of why a play is good they wont see it as anything special
[4:03:13] Fekk0r: Just need to master your shocked thumbnail face ;)
[4:03:18] Nightbot: Follow Hydra's twitter! https://twitter.com/hydramist
[4:03:23] buggy_k: its like this, since you focus on impressive gameplay but since the vast majority of players are ass, they want to watch some like asmongold who isnt that good either like them
[4:03:25] TrebekTv: its physical in vanilla
[4:03:27] jujujay_myalias: People are fucking dumb bro. If you wanna appeal to the masses you gotta dumb it down
[4:03:40] googlewooglex: oh okay, thanks!
[4:03:53] Creoxx: tiktok brain rot is also a real thing, just gotta be lucky ppl click on videos
[4:04:01] g_1_t: true
[4:05:19] Awezmoe: more Hydra raves
[4:05:47] griffithismydaddy: shorts ruined youtube
[4:05:56] Sinostra: @Awezmoe what's a hydrave ?
[4:06:12] Locky987: time to start over reacting to mundane things. OMG that guy just killed a boar POG
[4:06:28] Awezmoe: monkaHmm
[4:06:46] Pettidutt: and i thank you for it
[4:06:54] MxKV__: i miss Hydrave T_T
[4:07:31] Pettidutt: cant stand hyper shit, i really enjoy your qiality gameplay and calm demeanor
[4:07:37] jujujay_myalias: It's probably a tradeoff though. If you make quality continent for the right audience I'm sure your audience will stick around longer
[4:07:41] Sinostra: sure, gotta organise one in sod
[4:08:11] jxnxthxn05: thx for the games bruv cya around
[4:08:21] peeweeherman69: all the lil kids are fortnite brains they dont wanna play some slow ass antique game like wow
[4:08:41] motod0x: could be an interesting series of videos if you do how to beat a priest in a duel from all other class perspectives
[4:08:46] Extramediums: @Hydramist if my memory is working right for once, you went to uni for something like, engineering or something. Is that your long term plan for when you're done streaming?
[4:08:55] jonlelx: should bring back hydramist the website
[4:09:09] Fekk0r: I don't miss when my youtube shorts was flooded with people screaming about gdkp bids got old fast
[4:09:16] jonlelx: very niche market
[4:09:19] jonlelx: but i loved it lol
[4:09:41] Extramediums: You  missed the second half of the question :D
[4:09:53] Locky987: how to beat priest as warrior SMOrc
[4:10:07] peeweeherman69: should be a very quick vid
[4:10:11] peeweeherman69: 0 classes
[4:10:52] Extramediums: Oof, I'm glad you're making a living off this game that we've played for almost 20 years
[4:11:02] Extramediums: and a decent one at that
[4:12:03] Locky987: MOP classic into WOD classic we're retail classic soon
[4:12:07] bigdib84: pleasure to watch you sir
[4:12:17] Extramediums: Wrath was so diluted is how I felt about. The GDKP stuff, the RMT/tokens, etc. Those kinda of things being removed from the game would be wonderful
[4:12:20] EODMurphDeez: weak aura for total at the bottom of each spell on bars?
[4:12:25] Sinostra: the problem is, SoD is only gonna last one year
[4:12:35] bigdib84: maybe, maybe not
[4:12:56] jattefari: Pumper TUNE!
[4:12:58] Extramediums: If they treat SOD like a classic+, I don't think any one would be upset
[4:13:08] Sinostra: can you tell us what kind of games you like playing then ? we might be able to help you pick other games
[4:13:09] Locky987: lot of streamers go into variety for that reason I guess, your main game can die then it's FeelsBadMan
[4:13:20] bigdib84: we'll see, 1 year is long
[4:13:45] Extramediums: damn zoomers can't handle anything more than 30s snips. "GET OFF MY LAWN!"

[4:14:11] ktp_blue: RIP king of the hill PepeHands
[4:14:17] peeweeherman69: just wait for the next big zoomer focused game and jump ship LUL
[4:14:34] bigdib84: what's that? king of the hill
[4:14:42] Extramediums: Palworld lol
[4:14:46] dreeeamyy: goood evening
[4:14:49] Sinostra: sure, but you could get views from kinda anything, so might as well be a game you enjoy playing
[4:14:52] dreeeamyy: or good night rather
[4:15:00] peeweeherman69: viewbot
[4:15:38] EODMurphDeez: EODMurphDeez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:15:57] jonlelx: they gotta add some kind of "ranked" pvp mode in SOD. Feels like the demand is there
[4:16:10] Extramediums: I feel like Variety streaming is a crucial point of a streamer's career, if they can carry over and grow a community around a few games that they play frequently, they survive and generally have a broader audience. If they can't carry over their viewers, it's kinda the end
[4:16:20] Locky987: RBGs pls
[4:16:22] ktp_blue: I 100% understand the swap and it depends completely on viewer interest...which is ultimately lame. but I get it
[4:16:27] Locky987: 1v1 would be a bit too imbalanced for classic
[4:16:40] dreeeamyy: late night stream so very good GoldPLZ
[4:16:46] Nohez: hydraCreep_HF
[4:16:52] jonlelx: I don't think they could go wrong, 1v1s, RBG, arena, anything would be popular
[4:17:32] Extramediums: I think that shifting things to instanced lobby style would ultimately dilute the community and things like world pvp would start falling off
[4:17:45] dreeeamyy: as long as they dont do resilience, i wanna bring my PvE Andy gear and clap people LUL
[4:18:12] Extramediums: I wonder if the r14 grind will be a thing at 60
[4:18:17] peeweeherman69: just make it so u can que bgs in open world its shit afking at npc untill que pop
[4:18:38] Sinostra: how much subs on youtube are you aiming for ?
[4:19:09] Sinostra: cause you could get to 100k+ with pretty much anything imo
[4:19:38] shreddingog: time for MC with 40 r14 geared dads
[4:19:50] dzzyx95: !tierlist
[4:19:50] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy7p4lxHWt0
[4:19:53] Extramediums: I wish I had much more time for SOD and other games, Playing BDO and retail as well, but after decades playing them, they feel so hollow, priest feels like garbage since legion for all specs right now compared to previous iterations. I understand why so many pvpers have left retail.
[4:19:58] oddfud: song name anyone?
[4:20:23] oddfud: cant shazam ^^

[4:22:20] dreeeamyy: I Wonder whos gonna heal in phase 2 when all the priests go shadow LUL
[4:22:39] TrebekTv: maybe they will give shamans riptide, and some will wanna play
[4:22:52] peeweeherman69: only thing im looking forward to p2 is having a fucking mount
[4:23:24] TrebekTv: ik bro, we've been running around forever

[4:52:26] oddfud: i wonder how many in chat sitting in 36 que ^^
[4:53:09] drezski: warsong 36 btw
[4:53:51] oddfud: its more about how offense team is positioning instead map issues, but if enemy team is turtling with 0:1 score its monkaS and no serious rated bg grp would play like that
[4:55:28] nithru: now your fc is coming to you
