[0:20:29] Bromorin: Diablo 5 will probably be diablo immortal 2

[0:20:37] Kitkitten_: cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance cobaltDance
[0:20:38] PinkWardlol: Blizzard announced the next 3 expansions before the leakers could, that way they could milk the hype.
[0:20:50] Fanrogh: yeah im not buying the d4 expansion , the game isent even a finished product no way im spending money on that game
[0:20:54] Mrazulik: they are tring to make big bucks before they transfer under microsoft
[0:20:59] uselessend: Next wow expansion is same gimmick as caverns of ixalan lol

[0:21:03] DigitalVortex92: Well, to be fair, generally "leaks" are intentional so
[0:21:06] Leverei: for $40 extra
[0:21:06] bluechipps: @uselessend yeah, im pretty sure they just take chunks off the final product and charge for each one

[0:21:21] omegamango_: is there any helpfull mods or something that shows every achievements left on second file to get dead god?
[0:21:28] TorokFremen: Yeee cobalt online SeemsGood
[0:21:32] Mrazulik: sames is with cod3 they done that cause they want to cash out as much as they can before complete transfer
[0:21:51] AdeptStrain: Or they're going for more frequent, smaller expansions. Wouldn't be shocked to see Blizzard go for a monthly/yearly "Blizzard Pass" thing where you buy that and they just release content on it.
[0:22:10] uselessend: They are trying to make Diablo update more like wow I guess
[0:22:14] Mitune: The expansions are apparently normal 2 year expansions

[0:23:14] PaperbackWritter: @TorokFremen now you need to face cobalt NODDERS
[0:23:20] AdeptStrain: There's no way they have 3 expansions fully planned. You have a better chance of guessing the weather 6 years from now than anything in that 3rd expansion.
[0:23:47] tyranosaurusxx: All I've seen lately on gaming is the layoffs at bungie. It's all my pages consist of

[4:09:38] FrankFantome: @Endermanshadow Good thing about hardcore, is that every zone always has someone grinding the same quests as you. And people are more encouraged to help each other naturally. So it's really more chill to play solo in HC compared to matured servers.
[4:09:46] FatHalpert: I'll level with you danLove

[4:11:36] Endermanshadow: im so confused I jsut got hit with a my message wasent posted due to conflicts? ALl i said was im here for the man in the corner with a sip emote
