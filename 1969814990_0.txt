[0:49:44] frozenbread_: Take the pill :c
[0:49:44] Dendee: so they allow glitches, but not green pennies
[0:49:47] Dendee: for accessibility

[0:50:24] PrepotenEU: No free medicine
[0:50:24] Bazi1982: That means you set the no glich wr
[0:50:30] PaperbackWritter: they pause buffer after beating megasatan @andrehunter1
[0:50:32] deathmetalguineapig: @Dendee wait did they actually say the green pennies are not allowed?
[0:50:43] knoxxxed: knoxxxed subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Take the pill
[0:50:44] andrehunter1: @PaperbackWritter whats that for?
[0:50:45] humuhumunukunukuapua: For most games they usually have separate categories for glitched and no glitch speedruns
[0:50:48] Kitkitten_: The category says No major glitches/ glitchless. So they already think these glitches are acceptable.
[0:50:56] Kitkitten_: just sucks
[0:51:08] PaperbackWritter: @andrehunter1 make delirium hole appears after beating megasatan 100% of time
[0:51:11] Kitkitten_: It's not acceptable
[0:51:21] Tewma2: How is it done
[0:51:42] Kitkitten_: So this would mean you are really the fastest one imo
[0:51:43] kaiju_breath: Did they even accept the green penny mod
[0:51:56] communal_: we'll start our own category, with hookers and blow
[0:52:02] PaperbackWritter: they consider a glitch only things that completely break the game, but it is kind sketchy
[0:52:06] infinitywolf18: That way you do it is way cooler and more skill

[0:54:34] SlackAttacks: Petty... maybe. funny ... definitely
[0:54:36] Holyp1zza: If they're having fun doing it it is kinda petty.
[0:54:40] twiggywings: You're just pointing it out to the devs and they can decide if it should be in the game
[0:54:43] Queginn: Make a case for counting it as a major glitch and thus not glitchless
[0:54:48] PaperbackWritter: yes
[0:54:49] Kitkitten_: @twiggywings exactly
[0:55:07] infinitywolf18: I mean what if edmand made that intentionally is it still a glitch
[0:55:10] BEANorMAN: id say a little petty but not unjustified
[0:55:14] AlMightyBawb: the only reasonable fix is to remove delirium entirely :)
[0:55:20] thatcoalminer_: It'd be petty if you used it than asked for it to be removed

[3:14:30] vCubeTV: my issue is like, im scared of spiders but I dont wanna kill them, so trying to catch them is nightmare fuel :c
[3:14:30] Kizzle7284: It was so bad when I used to work in a hospital at night.
[3:14:38] SavMis_: i cant do dark closets
[3:14:41] Trollymog: If that went away, they wouldn't make horror movies.
[3:14:42] zeheal_abrum: i walk away quickly from my downstairs when it gets dark
[3:14:43] JohnnysHappyHideout: I am definitely wary of dark hallways, that's for sure.
[3:15:00] dingpong22: i also cant have a mirror in the bedroom always think im gonna see some shit
[3:15:04] krysher13: Every time I'm in front of a dark hallway, my brain just immediately goes "Somethings gonna rush at you now."
[3:15:22] CatsNSnacks: for some reason darkness + machinery (hvac, etc) is a bad combo for me, idk why
[3:15:24] dingpong22: its the ghost
[3:15:24] zeheal_abrum: your brain will force a scare sooner than anything that will actually scare you
[3:15:34] SavMis_: have you ever gotten paranoid after watching anything horror?
[3:15:39] sraeB: Overcame that as for the last 2 years i work nights and to get home i walk through a tunnel called stab alley :)
[3:15:49] Koroberry: were you ready to throw hands or were you about to scream? LuL
[3:15:52] PaperbackWritter: I took my first IV bag this year and I was in fear the whole time monkaS
[3:16:01] thatcoalminer_: Try working underground and your lights dies and you have to wait until someone finds you
[3:16:02] SavMis_: wonderful
[3:16:04] Overpathos: I was afraid of the dark as a kid, fervish imagination didn't help, now i'm always in the dark with a very dim light, 1800's style, no candles tho OMEGALUL
[3:16:13] Shadewfire: Aware angel
[3:16:13] thatcoalminer_: It's like a whole different level of darkness
[3:16:18] Overpathos: Now i just have fear of mannequins and porcelain dolls
[3:16:22] underscoreFishy: There's a whole area of the storage lockers in the basement of the building I live in where the lights are completely out and do not turn on. Shit is just unsettling
[3:16:26] Overpathos: Oh, also agoraphobic
[3:16:27] Vincybot: How old is hunter now? I remember the days of even before you were with Lisa. Time flies

[3:16:58] MrDropTheSoap: Just like you
[3:17:10] SavMis_: how do you feel for the uncanny valley?
[3:17:26] FatHalpert: is there a reason restedxp tells you to toss your hearthstone in WoW?
[3:17:42] Overpathos: Already 6? wow

[3:20:10] vCubeTV: whats your opinion on R keying the beginning of a run to make it easier?
[3:21:01] Zuldak: i heard arcane not r key... season 2 comes out next year
[3:21:11] vCubeTV: kek
[3:21:22] dingpong22: you got a floaty key Kappa
[3:21:22] SavMis_: have you ever done an all checkmark tainted cain run?
[3:21:26] AlmightyBobino: Use the one floating behind you.
[3:21:33] roguethemachine: as t lost sometimes i would r key before mom if my rom isnt goated since mom can ruin a run sometimes specially red mom
[3:21:48] Zuldak: maybe the real keys are the friends we meet along the way
[3:22:09] The_Ninjurai: What are friends?
[3:22:13] Shadewfire: For speedruns don’t you want to save R key for after the last boss?

[3:23:24] SavMis_: !fav
[3:23:24] Nightbot: Cobalts favorite items are Magic Mush, Deaths Touch, Holy Light, Death Certificate. Favorite regular character is Isaac, tainted is Judas. Least fun is Tainted Cain. Most difficult is Tainted Lost and Tainted Jacob.
[3:23:48] SavMis_: what is the worst item in your opinion?
[3:24:09] Nightbot: Come join Cobalt's Discord for live notifications, MTG chat and more! https://discord.gg/lokor
[3:24:20] SavMis_: (my bad)
[3:24:28] Radund01: Isaac's heart has to be the worst item
[3:24:29] roguethemachine: yeah insanely niche items :(
[3:24:50] roguethemachine: @demonkiller83 isaac heart only prob good with voodoo head for free improved curse room
[3:25:08] underscoreFishy: Dataminer is just meh. Isaac's heart is aggressive with it's badness. Cursed eye too
[3:25:12] 0wc4: isaac heart + blood rights still works?
[3:25:24] ShakeAndBake___: I was wondering that about blood rights
[3:25:28] Whitefoot93: Missingno is trash too
[3:25:29] andrehunter1: @0wc4 no
[3:25:44] 0wc4: lol why ruin the only good synergy
[3:25:55] SavMis_: id say clicker is easily bad too
[3:25:56] Radund01: @roguethemachine Have to have voodoo early in the run then get the heart early for it to be really worth it.
[3:26:08] BegForAbsol: worst item hands down is
[3:26:11] BegForAbsol: soy milk
[3:26:17] roguethemachine: @demonkiller83 same as every other niche combos
[3:26:21] ShakeAndBake___: soy works with some things now
[3:26:31] Overpathos: Soy is ok with some stuff
[3:26:36] SavMis_: soy milk is only good with othjer items and rock bottom but as a start its easil;y bad
[3:26:36] BegForAbsol: soy by itself
[3:26:39] BegForAbsol: trash
[3:26:42] ShakeAndBake___: I had soy with trisagion the other day and it was a great time
[3:26:49] roguethemachine: @demonkiller83 i got sanguine bound with scapular and goat head once on early floors farmed to about 30 dmg before i got bored
[3:26:51] Shadewfire: Just the tip
[3:26:55] BegForAbsol: Cobalt always says.... we never take question mark items because it might be soy
[3:27:08] Radund01: I actually like soy milk sometimes.  by itself it terrible if you dont get something by the end of cellar 1
[3:27:13] SavMis_: honestly brimstone to me isnt that great starting out/by itself tbh
[3:27:46] BegForAbsol: brim no tear is ass
[3:27:57] SavMis_: brim plus soy...
[3:28:07] BegForAbsol: brim snapping was the meta
[3:28:41] ShakeAndBake___: repentance brim soy is actually a synergy
[3:28:59] Radund01: @ShakeAndBake___ Add some dmg and we are cooking
[3:29:12] roguethemachine: yeah rep soy isnt bad but it needs a luck base item like soy + holy light or boogers goes insane
[3:30:16] diffserv: !wr
[3:30:49] roguethemachine: since when does circle of protection does decent dmg on the return projectiles
[3:31:33] SavMis_: ive never been able to understand that bosses movements
[3:31:49] roguethemachine: which @SavMis_
[3:32:03] illegalcatz: Lickitung would be a cool art for that boss
[3:32:04] Prepare2cry: wafer carries it nicely
[3:32:05] Ap0c4lyptyc: Its wahfer thin
[3:32:14] Overpathos: Bumbo wants coin...
[3:32:14] SavMis_: the one that moves like a hockey puck, cant remember their name
