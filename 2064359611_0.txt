[1:34:50] knoffx: legit the reason its dying
[1:35:00] snyggunnar: ok ty
[1:35:10] honsou2: @knoffx nah the reason its dying is actually that they got very greedy and the money grew way too fast
[1:35:27] pleebiceps: I hope so . i love watching you guys compete. Maybe would be much beter for esport scene if they let private tournaments and stuff like that ..
[1:36:37] Zevyn1312: fwiw they invested a LOT of money into OW and HOTS, and none into wow
[1:36:40] pleebiceps: @Raikubest If they cancel wow esports are you planning to go pro in some other  game ?
[1:36:41] Zevyn1312: So you're fine! :D
[1:36:56] rRememba: Lets see what happens, blizzard now gonna be on game pass
[1:37:06] honsou2: @rRememba not wow
[1:37:13] rRememba: @honsou2 in months yes
[1:37:28] honsou2: really?
[1:37:34] honsou2: wow is going f2p wow, so the end is here
[1:37:42] rRememba: obv 100% blizzard changes so many ppl inside
[1:38:01] pleebiceps: Do pro players get any benefits from blizzard ? Like don't have to pay sub money and shit like that ?
[1:38:02] Esotraz: oh they did ?
[1:38:10] rRememba: i completly sure that the month sub gonna disapear
[1:38:15] vothros: they addressed it? what did they say?
[1:38:16] Echo_Esports: Time for a break...from your current job? Come work with Echo! Apply at: echogg.ly/apply/Raiku
[1:38:16] Nextrkw: patch notes r out
[1:38:18] Nextrkw: mage nerfed
[1:38:26] honsou2: @rRememba so youre just guessing? you dont know?
[1:38:26] FoxiekittenWoW: @pleebiceps no
[1:38:29] crixx31: did u finish studying? what was it?
[1:38:37] VarhatTheWarr: What did th3y say foe MMR?
[1:38:47] pleebiceps: @FoxiekittenWoW That`s  crazy  :D
[1:38:51] honsou2: if the sub for wow goes away, the game is instantly dead. That means half the wow team is getting removed
[1:39:00] vothros: thought u said they addressed it lol
[1:39:40] FoxiekittenWoW: @pleebiceps why? everyone can sign up for their tournaments, no one is not actually a "pro" player in wow.
[1:39:41] rRememba: @honsou2 i dont think remove sub from wow will be bad
[1:40:02] Sameh5554: people playing on private servers anyway
[1:40:02] rRememba: valorant, lol games like that have no sub
[1:40:02] imitatewater: removing the sub for wow will be literally good for the game wtf is this guy saying
[1:40:06] honsou2: @rRememba thats a insane take
[1:40:06] vothros: have you thought about playing around with different mage builds maybe?
[1:40:13] rRememba: and have a masive esports community
[1:40:14] skystepx: Henlo MR
[1:40:21] abohassanx: raiku vad gör du för living då?
[1:40:31] Sameh5554: so its going to be smart to remove sub from wow and add the number playing on private servers to retail
[1:40:59] knoffx: maybe whaazz is the problem we can try some rmp if you want someone else Kappa
[1:41:05] honsou2: @rRememba theyre esports games. wow is not. The amount of content they make in wow is extremely different from those games. Wow is very expensive to run, if you remove the main income source and just add it to microsoft games then the game is gonna get gutted as a minimum viable product who now has no budget
[1:41:26] Akrololz: rmp so brocckenn
[1:41:42] knoffx: cant wait till they finally nerf rogue
[1:41:43] knoffx: and mage

[1:41:47] Akrololz: for grand finals
[1:41:51] bdsffgg: this a new dh?
[1:41:53] SpriestBuffed: its surprising that the best RMX team in the universe has to pick up a dh , still remember last arc you guys played against the meta and still won the champion
[1:41:54] Alegral: when will you join the Ceo of DHs in some LoL game @Raikubest  Kappa
[1:41:58] unsteddy: rmp mirror torunament when

[1:42:20] VarhatTheWarr: Blitz drops splinters every win
[1:42:20] magnusz: Demon Hunter omega lul
[1:42:21] knoffx: @Akrololz how do you win as assa in shuffle when the lobby is double dwarf hpal + dwarf ret + arcane mage + dh help a brother out

[1:42:50] Alegral: @magnusz  this class looks pretty strong will you try it ? Kappa
[1:42:51] crixx31: do u think if they make wow completely free and make it easy af to get full gear in pvp -like 2-3 days. they can revive pvp?
[1:43:03] knoffx: @honsou2 i did and the next lobby was dwarf outlaw survival hunter double hpal mage LUL

[1:43:49] magnusz: maggyBDS
[1:43:56] Nextrkw: i got a msg from the gms saying they need one more raiku mmr tweet and they'll fix it
[1:43:59] laki_svk: you mean 0.55 chance
[1:44:01] Nextrkw: and this guy refuses to do it
[1:44:04] Alegral: what if they decide to do changes day before tournament to troll you all LUL
[1:44:09] magnusz: u guys ever played the raiku drinking game
[1:44:09] sind233: guess we all playing DH until s4 then
[1:44:12] Poeter: wym blizzard are closed on Fridays Keepo
[1:44:15] honsou2: venruki made a tweet showing all the dumb DH stats and then just gave up posting it
[1:44:15] magnusz: every time he tweets about pvp u take a shot
[1:44:21] magnusz: ive been drunk for weeks
[1:44:34] Nextrkw: ye
[1:44:56] Poeter: @magnusz why not do it for Metaphors? You'll be on dialysis by day 3
[1:45:03] Nextrkw: i loved it
[1:45:25] Nextrkw: if judgements of the pure didnt get fixed you wouldnt even get top 3 that season
[1:45:29] Nextrkw: hahahah
[1:45:30] vothros: they nerfed dh same way this ssn no?
[1:45:40] shredder1111: half my friends quit when they made rets insane

[1:46:00] Akrololz: and guess what
[1:46:03] Akrololz: nothing changed
[1:46:04] Nextrkw: mirrors were soooo good
[1:46:06] honsou2: and then ret was still OP
[1:46:12] Poeter: the fw meta is back :D
[1:46:19] Akrololz: HAHAHAHAHHAHA

[1:47:03] Nextrkw: and then whaazz lived on 1 ho

[1:47:14] Nextrkw: :(
[1:47:22] GuyFromNorway95: are we talking first season shadowlands?
[1:48:06] iRarityz: nah fire is worse

[1:48:16] lilpulsing: I can think of a other few dogshit ones as well. :p
[1:48:26] tmh1995: frost dk
[1:48:37] Bicmexwow: time after time, people are so awful at predicting patch notes
[1:48:46] iRarityz: im just tired of going against dh every lobby
[1:48:49] lilpulsing: boomy frost fire mage sp mm
[1:48:52] GuyFromNorway95: but u have to agree tho, u rather have a broken ret then a broken frost or feral?
[1:48:55] wardelswijk: how is DH / sp comp?
[1:48:58] tmh1995: ah okay, no one ever thought frost dk was good :D
[1:49:20] SpriestBuffed: sp would carry dh's fatass hard
[1:49:21] honsou2: @GuyFromNorway95 doesent matter when its this level of broken?? 1600 ret paladins got 3600 in shuffle. It was the most disgusting thing ever
[1:49:24] sind233: @wardelswijk worse than dh/lock LUL
[1:49:29] lilpulsing: @wardelswijk If you play on NA it's good.
[1:49:33] tmh1995: no one wants a broken ret over a broken feral or mage.
[1:49:52] lilpulsing: @honsou2 now they can advertise as 3.6xp np
[1:50:00] Xcyyted: Wrath Icy Touch DK was insane too
[1:50:02] knoffx: sub rogue start of this season probably same level
[1:50:02] sind233: DK on release?
[1:50:04] GuyFromNorway95: Conjoke was op too
[1:50:05] Esotraz: people thought dh was more aids but i swear ret was 10 times more aids
[1:50:07] shredder1111: maybe tbc day 1 dk
[1:50:11] tmh1995: ret is the most played spec in the game and if u buff the most played spec by this the game turns into a clown fiesta
[1:50:12] honsou2: @sind233 dk never oneshot anyone
[1:50:35] Joke_Fistweaver: warrior season 12 mop was disgusting
[1:50:38] azliaris1: retpocalypse probably made so many people quit and never come back
[1:50:54] honsou2: @azliaris1 yeah i quit until late s3, all my friends did too and im the only one who came back so far
[1:50:55] Bicmexwow: bm hunter in mop bicmexClueless
[1:51:09] tmh1995: as ret was op the was the first and only time you had 4x of the same dps spec in shuffle in almost every high lobby
[1:51:13] Esotraz: stampede not bugged at all PepeLaugh
[1:51:13] Whaazz: war in season1 mop was also insane no
[1:51:17] GuyFromNorway95: some classes are worse broken tho. like holy pala being broken is the worst
[1:51:26] Nextrkw: no it wasnt @whaazz
[1:51:27] Whaazz: dh is for sure not as op
[1:51:34] honsou2: @Nextrkw yes it was
[1:51:37] Whaazz: when was war insane
[1:51:38] knoffx: i mean it lacks the utility and stuff
[1:51:38] Esotraz: s12 warrior was insane
[1:51:40] Joke_Fistweaver: just go watch reckful warrior video, speaks for itself
[1:51:40] Whaazz: they had this stack
[1:51:45] Esotraz: taste for blood @Whaazz
[1:51:45] knoffx: isnt devoker like the strongest standalone spec rn?
[1:51:47] tmh1995: give dh blade dance dodge back
[1:51:47] Nextrkw: nop trust me it wasnt
[1:51:50] tmh1995: then we can talk

[1:54:45] Esotraz: how would u even nerf dh
[1:54:47] Whaazz: What should I tweet
[1:54:52] Whaazz: Is this good
[1:54:52] sind233: SoD is for people who used to run but now sit in a wheelchair
[1:54:52] Whaazz: We need MMR inflation in all arena brackets, its completely dead and you can't push any rating. Please take a look at it or PvP will actually die out this season completely.
[1:55:00] honsou2: @Esotraz what? just nerf the damage
[1:55:11] corla1: @Whaazz yeah perfect
[1:55:16] Wizzuri: @Whaazz Yes.
[1:55:16] Esotraz: yes but how much @honsou2
[1:55:21] flattstv: The guy who controlled MMR was laid off and they dont know how to adjust it now LUL
[1:55:26] Whaazz: is there smth else I should mention
[1:55:29] Whaazz: this tweet is good no?
[1:55:30] honsou2: @Esotraz just a ton everywhere
[1:55:34] lilpulsing: So only way to climb past 2700 is to have some crazy winrate @Whaazz ? Is that what you're saying?
[1:55:37] Whaazz: do I write nerf dh in there too? Kappa

[1:56:31] augureygodx: @Raikubest @Whaazz return meh pls))0
[1:56:47] honsou2: @GuyFromNorway95 he means because its the end of season soon and awc is in 2 weeks so if they dont make changes now it will be too close to those things
[1:57:01] honsou2: reality is they know season ends in march, so why would they make changes now
[1:57:07] augureygodx: @Akrololz  заебал включи солоку на пирате, чот не могу понять где мой дмж
[1:57:09] FoxiekittenWoW: inflation is not a fix, its just the most pathetic bandaid on a outdated rating system. Instead of inflation they should rework it, else they will keep running into the same problem over and over.
[1:57:34] Esotraz: yes but they need to do a bandaid  fix while they work on something else
[1:58:51] AsdOfc: dh is pretty cool
[1:59:05] SpriestBuffed: wtf
[1:59:14] honsou2: @AsdOfc no its extremely cringe
[1:59:26] Esotraz: dh is Pog
[1:59:39] SpriestBuffed: dh is not even close to sp
[1:59:42] imitatewater: @honsou2 season ends end of march so there is still decent time left
[1:59:50] honsou2: every time i see an anime kid pressing blade dance animation i regret playing wow

[2:03:06] laki_svk: you did good that you saved cds for later dumpening
[2:03:07] xdtai: @Bicmexwow oh you're here, perhaps i should ask u LOL
[2:03:17] Yeyolol: Dude, frost mages are oneshotters now, not constant pressure, right?
[2:03:22] SpriestBuffed: mage haters
[2:03:35] Bicmexwow: @xdtai they're pretty good if you're alright
[2:03:40] SpriestBuffed: when can mage standup again
[2:03:59] blackvpnv: destro more uptime
[2:03:59] Bicmexwow: not like super crazy, probably will get some buffs instead of nerfs some future patch notes
[2:04:03] Bicmexwow: but it's not unviable
[2:04:05] FoxiekittenWoW: @Whaazz plz make a tweet about reworking the rating system. Sure inflation will do something but its just a bandaid fix that wont change anything.
[2:04:40] xdtai: @xdtai ive never played hunter, so wondering if i should gear my priest to try hpriest or gear hunter to try survival/bm
[2:05:05] thunderxmvp: Hpriest does not feel good rn unless you are Jayti or Meh

[2:18:16] laki_svk: why didnt you played immu dispell ?
[2:18:24] sammers21: second dh?
[2:18:37] quasxi1: @Raikubest the last expac that enjoy dh was bfa
[2:19:03] Lathspellz: did you do the glide macro whazz told you to use or is it just pain?
[2:20:04] Izostarx: man think about this game if they removed DH
[2:20:04] laki_svk: its also good becouse you can break roots by disangage in air
[2:21:02] asdkl2312k3o: What makes u a better player than whaaz in wow? What attributes is whaaz missing that u have?
[2:21:07] citricxy: sir you only play mage and dh ?
