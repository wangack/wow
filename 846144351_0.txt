[0:08:58] isollator85: because the top 2 guilds deleted vods or aren't streaming last boss
[0:09:43] ReinholdtRanger: Morning chat
[0:10:58] Aervyper: hello out there crazy people.... how bout that CYBERPUNK 2077 hype train

[0:15:48] Affiiance: So Echo not streaming Sire at all?
[0:16:18] isollator85: my understanding not till after reset
[0:16:40] Aervyper: nope roger brown gave the patent pending SCO speech and shut the stream off
[0:17:03] Aervyper: even insinuated that Complexity was going to do the same thing
[0:17:04] Affiiance: Damn I was enjoying watching Gengis stream, that sucks
[0:17:24] Aervyper: well don't sub to echo don't support them i say
[0:17:54] Affiiance: Yeah I mean they stopped streaming so I just unfollowed if they arent gonna stream
[0:18:04] fooxytv: what's happened, they not streaming the last boss?
[0:18:15] huongalt: you mean for world first ?
[0:19:24] Aervyper: Echo killed the 9th boss they did a couple pulls got to phase two immediately black screened then gave a speech about how they we're more or less done streaming for the week cause they didn't want Complexity to take their ideas and complexity was going to do it as well
[0:19:27] dekaron25: echo arent gonna stream last boss and now alot of ppl are angry
[0:19:33] shywolf: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[0:19:49] Aervyper: They might be in a guild called Echo but it sure sounded like a guild called method
[0:19:51] huongalt: they are pushing for wold first, so they can earn sponsorship.. why should they give away how they are planning to achieve it. 2 years ago you would not see anything of it
[0:20:25] Aervyper: i think there is more now money in streaming it on twitch than sponsership
[0:20:44] Sackington: people wanna be all mad now ... but had no problem before when these things werent even streamed. we only saw kill videos after like the first 3 guilds killed bosses
[0:20:59] huongalt: no idea. but i understand the method.. (see what i did there) lol

[0:28:53] Aervyper: to be fair i'm not happy or mad about guilds not streaming world first. I just find it's a mistake because the financial windfall from it is just too good to pass up

[0:29:25] Sackington: they need to win this RWF to gain even more financials
[0:29:28] Aervyper: Take towelliee Why did he do a 240 hour marithon..... cause this Shadowlands Launch is prime time for his year
[0:31:24] Affiiance: Viewership is gonna drop if people know in the beginning the last boss wont be streamed
[0:31:25] Aervyper: i don't care if echo streams it or not but i really hate the attitude they had about it
[0:32:02] Sackington: what attitude?
[0:32:15] Sackington: Gingi literally explained it all before they went "Dark"
[0:32:17] Aervyper: go watch roger browns last stream

[0:40:41] Aervyper: Anyone else buy a Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 copy to give to that person in your life you really hate?
[0:40:56] MrAJLaycock: Thanks for the 2020Partnered @antdavs24
[0:41:09] Noshpan: @dwolters I should've gone to bed 2 hours ago, but my sleep schedule got all fucked today. Otherwise I'm fine.
[0:41:54] jkitchin75: is it really that bad on ps4
[0:42:05] shmurcules: If towelliee worked a 9-5 he would be one of those employees that sit around for 45 minutes drinking coffee and bullshitting while everyone else is working lmao
[0:42:07] domTheCactus: @Aervyper nah, but i bought myself a PC version and really enjoying it so far
[0:42:26] Aervyper: soooo sad....
[0:42:28] Squidnapped: @domTheCactus I like it as well. however, it aint what it was hyped up to be. at all. lol
[0:42:33] Aervyper: glad your enjoying it on PC it looks alright
[0:42:45] Angerina: PC version even worked on my old PC with a 970
[0:42:46] kkaxig: chat what would you rate shadowlands 1-10?
[0:43:07] jkitchin75: 8
[0:43:08] domTheCactus: @SquiddsyTV i mean the hype was so big, people were expecting it to be a fkin life simulator in cyberpunk universe
[0:43:18] shmurcules: 6 .. kinda boring
[0:43:21] domTheCactus: i don't listen to hype, ever, it's always false expectations
[0:43:30] Aervyper: Shadowlands is very good 7-9 but getting around places, and Torghast / Maw SUCK
[0:43:50] Noshpan: It's not as bad as WoD, but not as good as MoP. So I'd say it's middle of the ground so far.
[0:43:52] kkaxig: @aervyper yes thats the biggest con imo
[0:44:02] Aervyper: why everyone isn't given a 30 minute engineer toy is just STUPID
[0:44:20] MrAJLaycock: I'm not putting a number on Shadowlands and Torghast yet until Twisting Corridors come out.
[0:44:20] dwolters_the_zombieman: @towelliee hi buddy I'm excited to see you soon It's almost Christmas are you and Lula going to do something special

[0:44:46] kkaxig: @mrajlaycock whats twisting corridors?
[0:44:46] Noshpan: totREE
[0:45:13] MrAJLaycock: @kkaxig It's the next Torghast bit.
[0:45:30] Aervyper: honestly Torghast if you want that type of game by Risk of Rain 2 and Slay the spire...... Torghast will never be as good as either of those titles
[0:45:39] shmurcules: You can get a mount for the maw right?
[0:45:52] Aervyper: 11d
[0:45:52] dekaron25: ye
[0:46:03] MrAJLaycock: @shmurcules Yes. By doing Layer 8 of Twisting or from the weekly kill of Hunt: Shadehounds.

[0:47:22] MrAJLaycock: @domTheCactus They nerfed the upper layers hard.

[1:03:56] baaronthemonk: Kyrian represent

[1:04:15] Epicrider88: @towelliee how do you feel about echo doing a non stream to hide strate, do you feel it hurts the legitimacy of the raid to world 1st as making it as a esport
[1:04:26] Jarlbarack: @towelliee have u looked at ur weekly loot yet?
[1:04:41] MrGattz: loot is so bad this xpac that you would be dumb to extend
[1:04:42] Affiiance: Theres no way they extend
[1:04:46] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee did you get @Lula something special for Christmas

[1:04:57] tumb_tack: tumb_tack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:05:02] Affiiance: No one knows, Echo isnt streaming
[1:05:06] Fabsst: Who would you say it the best tank in the top 3 guild for the world first race?
[1:05:15] mrpresbaby: Man those guys
[1:05:23] magemaster225: if a guild kills denathrius and no ones around to see it does it, is it killed
[1:05:24] SlayerLightStorm: @ttvepicrider88 I think it does. Hiding strats is cheating.
[1:05:25] bryan9145: Can u extend the lock timer for mythic or that was never a thing?
[1:05:29] confewsed: @ttvepicrider88 how do you feel about Limit doing the same on council?
[1:05:30] domTheCactus: everyone talking about echo not streaming, i think it's their business and decision, don't know why everyone is so butthurt
[1:05:32] jimmwayne: limit has 40&
[1:05:33] thunder993: People being mad about that are so dumb LULW
[1:05:41] MrGattz: they are probly exploiting lets be real Kappa
[1:05:46] Antdavs24: do you even have a best pull if you dont show it Kappa
[1:05:47] elfwyn20: whats the best legenday for prot in your opinion bro?
[1:05:50] Zivs: Max was saying if this becomes a trend they will re-think if they want to stream it at all in the future as well @Towelliee :(
[1:05:54] domTheCactus: @thunder993 i agree
[1:05:57] Aervyper: the only thing that it hurts for ECHO is in their pocketbook
[1:05:59] mobbo: The shit takes chat has is great
[1:06:23] mrpresbaby: It’s an unspoken obligation imo
[1:06:42] ydinvoima: I think they will stream after us reset
[1:06:43] Staksor: some people are dumb enough to send death threats FailFish
[1:06:45] IGett: I mean Limit did it first and they have said that they will start streaming again after the reset more or less
[1:06:46] mallister_: why would it be an obligation, they owe nothing to the viewers
[1:06:53] Orthobullet: Maybe some financial consequences in the long run for that
[1:06:57] falldrgn: at this point streaming the race has become secondary.. this is the actual race...
[1:07:01] Slitze: i'm half paying attention what?
[1:07:07] gimpling_: It's not uncommon for top end guilds to hide the final bosses before now
[1:07:08] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[1:07:10] Slitze: false advertisement
[1:07:17] shmurcules: Just don’t watch the guilds that blacked out on us .. don’t support them at all
[1:07:18] thunder993: they said they want to wait till reset
[1:07:22] Vanidor: How did you create your intro @Towelliee? It's so good
[1:07:24] domTheCactus: @mrpresbaby unspoken obligation is very bad wording dude, it sounds like "the implication" from it's always sunny in philly
[1:07:26] MrGattz: @Staksor i mean people are so dumb on the internet that you can release a bad patch to any game and get death threats. nothing new there
[1:07:31] TheUnknowing: I personally think them not streaming the kill doesnt make any difference in the long run, not streaming it isnt going to help them kill it faster or better
[1:07:41] MrGattz: i ban people and get death threats. nothing new.
[1:07:42] Exoduc: How dare they not entertain me NotLikeThis D:
[1:07:44] Rexy95: Didnt limit kill council offline aswell ?
[1:07:46] Kaype92: People should be happy they streamed the race to begin with. They never had to when they formed Echo
[1:07:58] Slitze: hype my nuts don't advertise what a joke
[1:08:04] mrpresbaby: @domthecactus how would you say it?
[1:08:05] Chubbyfists: Hey towelliee.. any advice for a new tank
[1:08:05] flyingmachin3: they did do council offline
[1:08:07] Halgrender: @MrGattz For real?
[1:08:08] Orthobullet: Doesnt sit well. Possibly hurts the RWF event
[1:08:11] cahoots82: Limit killed offline but it wasn't like they were trying to hide their strat. They just weren't expecting it to go down
[1:08:12] TheUnknowing: 'accidentally' @Rexy95 but council wasnt the last boss lol
[1:08:13] MrGattz: @Halgrender ofc!
[1:08:14] manessagra: but i bet your anus is wet for Limit
[1:08:14] Slitze: phonies
[1:08:17] common_taco: But I want to see it, shouldn't they want what I want
[1:08:18] Antdavs24: i demand refunds! Kappa
[1:08:19] Halgrender: Holy shit
[1:08:21] rosina_scarlett: @flyingmachin3 limi's council kill was accidental
[1:08:22] bryan9145: If i was guild leader i would just let echo stop trying to kill Sire and just wait for the reset
[1:08:23] Slitze: bunch of phonies
[1:08:25] Zivs: I'm mad because this might up ending up in neither party streaming it again

[1:08:34] Rexy95: @TheUnknowing hmm
[1:08:35] Cypfer: Oprah money
[1:08:37] Slitze: don't act like your big time then
[1:08:42] mrpresbaby: Imagine if Limit didn’t stream like that then how would EU even gets strays?
[1:08:46] mistertootoo: imagine if the NFL did that. Did not broadcast the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl. hahaha.
[1:08:47] MattK187: They're just doing it for TODAY only before reset. They're back on tomorrow. Gingi said himself. Why is everyone making such a big deal of this!?
[1:08:49] Layercake: If their sponsors don't care...why would someone else care , i don' get it LUL
[1:08:51] mrpresbaby: strats*
[1:08:54] cahoots82: @Bigredkitty24 they did it in 13 pulls...they weren't expecting a kill
[1:08:59] Slitze: bringing in that money.. give it back
[1:09:00] domTheCactus: i don't agree that it is an obligation at all, or a rule, they can do whatever the fk they want and it's their business, not good to advertise something and not do it but this is like so small problem i can't even
[1:09:12] Antdavs24: council aint the big dog fan boy Kappa
[1:09:14] Alzar_tv: Didn't they also post the kill video while Echo was still on it? lol
[1:09:19] falldrgn: Well towliee They were going to kill it off stream but they didn't think it would take as long as it did.
[1:09:20] Throdio: It's disappointing. It must really sucks for those that subbed to get rid of ads to watch it, just to not be able to watch the boss that really matters

[1:09:27] Slitze: glade i spent maybe 2 minutes watching it
[1:09:32] eaglerydr: If they don’t stream the money won’t be there. Why would sponsors support that
[1:09:34] Epicrider88: it took echo 30 trys like it was like the hid a 400 pull boss
[1:09:38] mobbo: That is not fanboyish
[1:09:39] dwolters_the_zombieman: @MrGattz are you serious about people give you death threats that is stupid that they do that
[1:09:41] Zivs: Echo turned it off for Heroic Denathrius too LUL
[1:09:54] Adraythien: think they said they will return streams in 5hours no?
[1:09:54] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[1:09:56] Halgrender: Both are bad decisions. Simple as that. No point defending one is worst than another.
[1:10:05] bmike: even if its council or not it was still off stream. You cant take that away. Ofc it`s a dirrerent thing between a mid tier boss and last boss.
[1:10:06] maldexoo: They will stream again when limit is done with reclearing. They didnt want to leak comp
[1:10:09] Rexy95: well i can see why they do it cause of the "different reset times
[1:10:12] Too_Ineffable: What’s your favorite race and specialization’s
[1:10:15] Keyastaron_: ill help :P
[1:10:16] mobbo: Both are not bad decisions they are just decisions
[1:10:16] manessagra: can't blame em, reset a day ahead is a big advantage
[1:10:17] bmike: different
[1:10:25] Kaykerrs: I can heal
[1:10:29] Kaykerrs: If need
[1:10:29] Slitze: imagine watching the super bowl and halftime they decide to stop broadcasting
[1:10:32] Slitze: joke
[1:10:40] mobbo: Not comparable
[1:10:44] MrGattz: @dwolters oh 100% lol. all channel mods on twitch get them eventually. im just the main mod of this channel so i would get them more then the others. to be fair though, i havnt had one this year! so thats a plus haha
[1:10:46] domTheCactus: at all
[1:10:50] Staksor: @MrGattz damn that's crazy monkaS being a mod is a no joke
[1:10:55] Halgrender: Thinking about as pure content creator, Max had almost twice the viewers Echo had when they decided to stop streaming on Council. I mean, it's all fucked up, imo
[1:10:57] manessagra: yeah, that analogy is nonsensical
[1:10:59] ydinvoima: Wonder if we will ever see China/Korea guild world first
[1:11:01] Adraythien: @Towelliee Echo guild posted on twitter the stream will be live in 4h30
[1:11:04] zjordan88: i also have a 190 resto druid if needed
[1:11:06] bmike: @Slitze And you mean in NFL they dont hide strats from tha other team? haha
[1:11:20] rosina_scarlett: Limit did off stream pulls of council for wa's
[1:11:24] Shrenko: what legendary are you using?
[1:11:27] Exoduc: bring the 80 ilvl shaman
[1:11:29] GeeThePally: both guilds should have started at same time TBH for a true world first race CL had a day ahead start and are still level
[1:11:41] Slitze: @bmike talking about advertising your world first bringing in money
[1:11:42] Kaykerrs: Gotta turn on wow lol
[1:11:58] Antdavs24: they're probably not Kappa
[1:12:00] maldexoo: its about their comp, not the strat
[1:12:00] ludzki__: at the end of the day it was never always streamed right? so whats the big deal now? :D all they said was is US have a reclear before us thats all so they have a gear advantage :p
[1:12:02] MrGattz: @Staksor eh you get a couple angry 10 year olds that think they are tough shit. im never worries, i just report them to twitch and continue on
[1:12:06] common_taco: @mrgattz Then I'll send you life threats. Go love a healthy happy life and keep up the good work! Take that!
[1:12:12] falldrgn: Shade>Echo\Limit
[1:12:18] Kaype92: How in the world are people already clearing mythic 18s?!?
[1:12:19] manessagra: they said they will stream at 4PM, which is in 2 and a half hours
[1:12:26] 24Lunatic: all this is the same shit different day
[1:12:37] TheUnknowing: It doesn't matter at the end of the day @GeeThePally the headstart doesn't matter after a certain amount of time, at this point it doesn't fucking matter at all.
[1:12:44] MrGattz: @common_taco haha i appreciate it cohhHug
[1:12:51] LoseAlotLuke: it only matters if limit kill sire within 12 hours of this NA reset @Towelliee
[1:12:53] ludzki__: so many people angry about something we arent apart of and are just spectators :p this is a big thing for the top guilds
[1:12:54] falldrgn: IMO.. we have a raid challenge.. Limit Vs Echo. Head to Head just them. no resets\head starts
[1:12:54] Throdio: The way I see it, if your going to make a while production and advertise a world first race, you should stream all of it. If your concerned about not showing starts, just don't stream it.
[1:13:04] BreastFriends: OLimit literally bug testing the raid for echo
[1:13:06] nilachip: look at this us boi
[1:13:08] Antdavs24: but but but time differences BabyRage Kappa
[1:13:13] makuto_gaming: I dont think who starts first doesn't matter, but I think arguably the reset matters more with the vault and reclears etc
[1:13:15] bmike: @Slitze Still All streamers can choose either to stream their conent or not. Ofc i rather watch the stream. But that what to went with so just accept it and enjoy other guilds playing in the RWF
[1:13:19] frastly: you are not fine beacuse of early reset, that is most op shit
[1:13:20] manessagra: you're not even after a first reset, you get the gear and at least 10 hours of last boss tries
[1:13:20] JinzDan: Serious question, do you think Echo would not have stopped streaming if Limit didn't kill Council offstream, or do you think they planned it?
[1:13:25] Ribbwich: @Towelliee wait there are people who legit think they are required to stream their attempts?
[1:13:35] GeeThePally: Yeah i agree mate, i'm really surprised at how Method are performing having to restart from scratch again
[1:13:36] Lupusdeus: Lupusdeus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:13:37] Raketenraucher: ???
[1:13:39] Slitze: @bmike $$
[1:13:40] TheUnknowing: @LoseAlotLuke it literally does not, cause they have both gotten to the end boss around the same time, headstart didnt matter at all this entire time with echo catching up to limit
[1:13:41] nomad_91: @mrgattz best mod

[1:14:02] Halgrender: Blizzard doing a decent job by fixing bugs much faster it seems
[1:14:15] TheUnknowing: No @falldrgn people never bitched about the 'headstart' til limit started winning in nya and now
[1:14:20] mobbo: EU doesn’t have maintenance?
[1:14:26] bmike: Well with alot more gear you can do alot in 8 hours so hehe
[1:14:27] Slitze: @bmike i dont' give a shit who wins and haven't watched. but u call a spade a spade

[1:14:28] PrisheBurningBlade: Imagine being worried Limit is going to copy your strat, when you spent 1hr watching their kill video figuring out their exact timers for CDs, and Kill strat for Generals
[1:14:29] D_Nobody1: Thanks for the 2020Forward @nin3r101

[1:14:59] frastly: headstart is no problem, only early reset week into progress
[1:14:59] falldrgn: @PrisheBurningBlade they both take things from each other.. all the top guilds do that..
[1:14:59] mobbo: I can’t stand guild fanboys...
[1:15:01] LoseAlotLuke: theyre like Patriot fans @Towelliee
[1:15:03] nilachip: what about the limit fan bois like you ?
[1:15:04] griffdog125: EU didn't get the maintenance na did.
[1:15:05] Ribbwich: @Towelliee I love that they gloss over the fact of why the Echo members left Method to begin with
[1:15:06] GeeThePally: same guild minus a few people lol.
[1:15:06] NplusK: Limit wins one race and its the end of the world, goes both ways

[1:15:37] bmike: Echo this or Limit that fanboys does the same shiet.
[1:15:37] danimoto10: ooof
[1:15:38] PrisheBurningBlade: EU would have lost 2 world wars if the US didn't' save them, only makes sense they need to copy our strats
[1:15:41] Squidnapped: Woo woo! Lets get it Towelliee. Hope all is well
[1:15:42] manessagra: i think they should just have server reset at same time for eu and na, solves that problem
[1:15:42] 24sevn: echo doing quite well this tier tbh
[1:15:43] k3vvinn: k3vvinn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[1:16:05] dwolters_the_zombieman: @Towelliee thanks for a great year of streaming The Hammer Squad is like a family to me
[1:16:09] Lupusdeus: Honestly, I think as Limit has got bigger and won last tier in BFA they have gained a shitload of toxic fans too and the whole RWF community has become toxic with blind fanboyism @Towelliee
[1:16:09] maldexoo: I don't understand this whole thing. Like Echo said, they don't want Limit to see that they are using like 5 Mages or something. So Limit will not gear them caracters up during reclear. After Limit is back at Sire, Echo will stream again. Thats It.
[1:16:10] anamroth: yep
[1:16:19] Ribbwich: idgaf if echo streams their Denetharius strats or not, if they think they can beat it they willl stream it
[1:16:20] DeanoTV: good race
[1:16:20] Slitze: LUL

[1:16:43] eaglerydr: Agree towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[1:16:46] b1z49: People for. Get echo have no sponsor and they win this race they get so much from it and limit killed a boss offline who cares
[1:16:48] Zivs: That's more Alliance guilds than I remember from last tier :o
[1:17:01] Snuskleffe: nice us list u got there Keepo
[1:17:02] Lupusdeus: They only night raid too
[1:17:03] nLinkn: the start might not. but once its past a reset its def an advantage
[1:17:04] maldexoo: I don't understand this whole thing. Like Echo said, they don't want Limit to see that they are using like 5 Mages or something. So Limit will not gear them caracters up during reclear. After Limit is back at Sire, Echo will stream again. Thats It.
[1:17:04] Ribbwich: @nLinkn bruh EU has like 98% of world firsts, the time difference doesn't matter lol

[1:17:43] frastly: we will know in due time, just chill
[1:17:54] majintoaster: whether echo streams or not, limit will down sire first. so it doesn't matter.
[1:17:54] Pudgypantss: @Affiiance not really. They might start after raid reset

[1:18:42] anamroth: garrosh :D
[1:18:44] Epicrider88: what i think is funny is bow preheat talks about how he's the best fire mage and limited has been using a diffrent firemage for world 1st race
[1:18:44] Ribbwich: @manessagra because people overreact
[1:18:45] gimmlay: you will seee garros

[1:57:43] TheUnknowing: Just got to think of how easy a reclear will actually be, they probably wont have any issues up to sludge or generals but cant guarantee a oneshot on everything
[1:57:43] xhriiis: stone legion rekill might be a slight tilter though if it doesnt happen fast enough
[1:57:50] ListeningClose: I b et they have trouble making it back to last boss tbh
[1:57:59] spekktrum19: Echo’s plan of not streaming only helps them if they kill today
[1:58:18] SpilledMelk: is Stone Generals getting any nerfs or at least some fixes today?
[1:58:38] Kaykerrs: They did a shitload of fixes in the list

[1:58:45] theGooderz: what are your thoughts on Echo not streaming Denathrius? Do you ultimately think that the buck stops at Blizzards door and the fact of not having the raid as a Global Release?
[1:58:54] Pudgypantss: @spekktrum19 thats the point. They arnt streaming until NA reset and limit has to reclear
[1:58:58] Kaykerrs: necrolord prob @zaraine1
[1:59:14] generalmarcus35: echo isn't streaming the final boss?
[1:59:18] LoseAlotLuke: Divine Favor for hpaly is nuts
[1:59:19] Cypfer: Towellie go holy cow Kappa
[1:59:53] nephttv_: I am necro
[2:00:05] falldrgn: Limit in Uldir..
[2:00:07] spekktrum19: @generalmarcus35 echo said they won’t stream last boss until NA reset and Limits raid resets
[2:00:13] falldrgn: cost them the race

[2:01:29] firefly_on: today*
[2:01:41] spekktrum19: They’re probably about the same as Limit
[2:01:41] tocu: last known info on echo is they got to 70% after 6 pulls than went dark
[2:02:10] actionbtrd: How do i get that circle around my cursor?
[2:02:12] generalmarcus35: Sonsabjtches!!!
[2:02:19] sosoxx12: @spekktrum19 that depends on how well this strat they really wanted to hide works out
[2:02:22] MOLAR305: echo no streaming is a loss of $. is their strategy sooo diff?
[2:02:27] sosoxx12: they could be really ahead for all we know
[2:02:32] Zippaya: its legit strat, why ppl flame so much about not streaming
[2:02:51] quakegoogl: ruyuLEG ShowOfHands
[2:03:09] xhriiis: because people were excited about watching the race from both sides
[2:03:13] spekktrum19: They could but I doubt it, nothing so far this race has shown that their strats are better than Limits

[2:03:50] JxJay: do you only get one loot from the great vault?
[2:03:55] spekktrum19: They both took ideas for their strats from each other
[2:03:56] bryan9145: In my opinion world first is for bragging rights
[2:03:59] Sincline387: It might be interesting to see if future sponsorships include "must stream" clauses
[2:04:10] Cypfer: that will never happen
[2:04:14] BTiZZY_: @bryan9145 100%
[2:04:14] thebakeriscomingforu: Since they are sponsored they already have the money/ it's coming. So as long as they follow the terms of the agreement then they are good.
[2:04:54] JxJay: @bryan9145 but it does bring the wow community together and it brings in new comers too
[2:04:55] Drakenking: monkaS
[2:05:12] spekktrum19: I find it funny that Echo never got to P3 all of Sunday while doing progression, Limit kills it late Sunday night and then Echo kills it within a few hours on Monday

[2:56:19] Masqerader: nothing is pug worthy on a tyrannical storming week
[2:56:22] Vigi9413: I was mistaken

[2:58:49] Digidan2005: shootin for nurgash for world boss
[2:58:50] 8bitbarbarian: if a group can do an 11, they at least know the basics, but a group that can do an 11 won't necessarily be able to do a 15 independent of gear

[3:58:16] I_DoctorSatan_I: He's actually still testing BETA Kappa
[3:58:20] Artivicii: Turning off their streams? LUL
[3:58:21] hotguy6packabs: What did echo do

[3:58:52] Technogre: Hes on the sub server duh
[3:58:55] Nosusee: ok thanks
[3:58:57] aesirsghost: They turned streams off for M Sire prog.
[3:59:00] ThisTHC: people are actually upset that theyre progressing sire offstream ?
[3:59:05] Artivicii: Imagine being mad at a guild for not streaming their world first kill KEKW
[3:59:06] chulklol: when reset NA?
[3:59:16] SpoonManes: fiends for the content ahah
[3:59:17] darrthbrooks: is world fist done yet or did they finish week one 8/10?
[3:59:18] aidonn: Eveyone is a snowflake now a days
[3:59:21] SethSteckler: @nexecutioner they stopped streaming Denathrius so they wouldn't give Limit any advantage. Kind of similar to what Limit did with Council but people are super upset because it's the final boss
[3:59:24] LSBreed: Not mad, it just takes away from the fun of watching the world first race.
[3:59:25] MrGattz: imagine being upset over a race in a video game
[3:59:27] burfurlur: that content is like ancient mana
[3:59:29] trivwik: They finished 9/10
[3:59:35] I_DoctorSatan_I: @ThisTHC Corp Sponsors aren't happy about it.
[3:59:37] darieoper: Is this Swiftys chair?
[3:59:42] amricatt: @chulklol Now. Should be finished by 8am pst
[3:59:44] Arcke87: Sadly, there will never be another 87 day streak where a world first boss isnt killed, in memory of Ouro
[3:59:47] veryboredguy1: they are not mad it just makes echo look kinda lame compared to limit and everyone else
[3:59:52] brain_wash: Imagine the reaction if Limit didnt stream any of their kills, REEEEEEE heard for miles
[3:59:52] jason_tacey: damn he got rekt
[3:59:53] Masqerader: @MrGattz I can understand people who subbed to their channel expecting to watch content, other than that, I agree with you
[3:59:55] MrGattz: @LSBreed i will agree with that though. it does suck. but people are taking it wayyy to far
[4:00:01] newmetah: wait how is towelliee on atm?
[4:00:04] newmetah: servers are down
[4:00:08] Arcke87: oh my god
[4:00:09] jason_tacey: EU
[4:00:10] SpoonManes: he hacked wow
[4:00:11] I_DoctorSatan_I: EU
[4:00:11] chulklol: @sethsteckler nah on council its was out of streaming time.. and they said we gonna do few trys..
[4:00:12] Arcke87: eu man, eu servers
[4:00:12] amricatt: Magic
[4:00:15] I_DoctorSatan_I: J F C ppl
[4:00:17] I_DoctorSatan_I: get a clue
[4:00:17] newmetah: damn eu!
[4:00:18] nativej96: i thought servers went down hours ago why are they down wtf?
[4:00:22] tom_badil_: towel has special Nikolaus server Kappa
[4:00:24] hagmania: obviously nothing is owed to anyone, but imagine not expecting this kind of backlash
[4:00:26] tom_badil_: aka Santa
[4:00:29] MrGattz: @Masqerader thats also true, that does suck if you paid for content that you expected to get and then it just didnt happen
[4:00:33] GIJosh86: how do this many ppl not know about eu servers?
[4:00:34] LSBreed: @mrgattz agreed I'm not raging over it just feels like a let down.
[4:00:37] SethSteckler: @chulklol ahh I see, so Echo should've just lied about why the stream went down like Limit, gotcha
[4:00:40] SpoonManes: oh yeah thats right he shrank and went down tha chimneh
[4:00:40] Arcke87: LOL
[4:00:41] NoWaayMan: limit didnt stream one boss and an entire continent thought they cheated....but NA is mad lmao
[4:00:41] captin421: World first streamed races was methods brainchild. Then they lose a race and don’t stream the pentacle boss of the race. Bad for business at the very least.
[4:00:44] jason_tacey: YEP
[4:00:51] Kinghorn: they caught you slacking
[4:00:53] Xailen: you got teh uber PK'd
[4:00:56] Artivicii: Ion did it , we saw him
[4:00:57] eyemyor: @Towelliee Bit surprised at how well Method is doing in this race?
[4:01:00] dwolters_the_zombieman: @MrGattz true and it's kind of funny how people get upset over something stupid lol
[4:01:01] Apokolipz: Alliance has no honor
[4:01:13] chulklol: @sethsteckler lie? max tweeted asap and the video kill went up asap dude
[4:01:18] SpoonManes: no honor amongst thieves. lok tar
[4:01:19] chulklol: its different
[4:01:28] newmetah: of course tehy arent going to strream the last boss, why would they give strategy away for free for their competitors?
[4:01:31] sagethemage40: Echos chat is melting down
[4:01:33] Holysal: @eyemyor nope they have alot of good players
[4:01:41] Mecabeast: I think there's more prestige if you get wf kill on last boss while streaming
[4:01:44] Artivicii: Echo still gonna win KEKW
[4:01:46] LSBreed: @dwolters it's okay to be upset, but to rage out at them and blow up Twitter and threats that's way to far.
[4:01:46] Webw0lf359: lies there are no alliance with WM on, the forums say so
[4:01:49] Twonce: Good morning @Towelliee
[4:01:55] kodtheog: @Towelliee im excited for riots new mmo not to replace wow but to push wow to keep creating good xpac/content they need some competition
[4:01:59] chulklol: they didn't
[4:02:01] gmo2000: @towelliee ty for the gfuel discount just ordered a shaker an some fazeberry.
[4:02:01] MammothGB: Nope they're not streaming til tomorrow, after EU reset
[4:02:02] Zilimir: Pretty sure Future started the mythic progress streaming in Nighthold. Right?
[4:02:03] LSBreed: they have been down since yesterday.
[4:02:12] Webw0lf359: Echo are not streaming until after re-set tomorrow
[4:02:14] nativej96: nah i think horde are the grimy fraction, and i play horde
[4:02:20] SethSteckler: @chulklol I'm not sure what the video has to do with anything? The fact that they were recording it at all shows that they weren't just testing and knew they could down it
[4:02:21] Antdavs24: the echo stream is just two other WoW streamers talking lol
[4:02:27] eyemyor: @Holysal They do have a lot of good players, absolutely. Before the race, Towel was saying they wouldnt be even close.
[4:02:31] Kinghorn: any lockout extenders in chat
[4:02:31] HaxzorJimDuggan: or just wait till Limit get the WF KEKW
[4:02:35] RealZedz: They’ll wait for echo to kill it first
[4:02:41] Artivicii: Yeah I’m stoked for the re clear lol
[4:02:41] Wrizzik: I'm confused. I thought OTK was going to have a WF team, but instead they just broadcasted. But I guess I misunderstand the statement, "we're doing race to wf"
[4:02:44] RealZedz: Limit
[4:02:45] Thoreya: rip the world first race after this tier
[4:02:49] Artivicii: Always fun watching a reclear
[4:02:50] Thoreya: limits gonna do the same thing next tier
[4:02:50] chulklol: @sethsteckler and how come you compare a shity boss to last boss lol..
[4:02:54] MammothGB: I'm fine with them trying to keep an advantage on Sire, but to announce on twitter they will be streaming and it be nothing is a bit shitty
[4:02:58] Clicklesly: They'll stream the Sire kill when they see Limit didn't extend Kappa
[4:03:01] Sollice: They were just doing broadcasting
[4:03:06] Nikione0one: Edible ads? LUL
[4:03:08] Kinghorn: if either of them extend they are out of their minds
[4:03:10] SethSteckler: @chulklol ahh ok now we get to the defense. Nice talking to your dumb ass
[4:03:13] Thoreya: bc limit is gonna do the same thing next tier
[4:03:14] Sollice: I don't think they will plan on fielding a RWF team for OTK
[4:03:17] dwolters_the_zombieman: when Limit had their chat on sub only mode and couldn't say hi I'm not mad I still watch lol
[4:03:19] Sevendash: back in my day nobody streamed prog publically
[4:03:21] NoWaayMan: next tier might be different. echo is setting a precedence
[4:03:21] drunken_werewolf_hunter: @towelliee I am still mad echo has bitched out of streaming
[4:03:27] Deathkanigit101: @Towelliee They said they wanted to wait till after reclear because they did not want to give the upper hand to limit with rest happening per gingi.
[4:03:30] NekogamiOrigin: Whoa I just got 6 ads in a row
[4:03:33] Artivicii: @sevendash okay boomer Kappa jk me too
[4:03:38] chulklol: @sethsteckler ur the one qq about it lul LUL
[4:03:40] Choowey: 6? im at 9 buddy
[4:03:41] Alienfromger: pls santa clause gift me a sub so i dont have to suffer from ads LUL
[4:03:44] gorilla_quantistico: if they had a super secret strat boss would be dead by nnow
[4:03:45] pavepawns: atm limit is my most likely candidate to win
[4:03:51] eyemyor: @Towelliee I think your prediction of Method's demise was a bit hasty, sir. They're actually doing well.
[4:03:55] Dark_lite7: It's going to be such an anti climax if they kill it off stream
[4:03:57] SaltyTunapants: @Towelliee if they get further in the phases then limit they dont want limit to get an idea of who to gear in splits
[4:03:58] MESSYPUP: y
[4:04:04] Bokehhbob: Servers back up already?
[4:04:04] NekogamiOrigin: buffering ads SeemsGood
[4:04:10] Masqerader: @Eladarmri no
[4:04:11] Arcke87: eu
[4:04:14] Nikione0one: 12 ads in a row? :(
[4:04:15] SethSteckler: @chulklol keep thinking that
[4:04:15] duffluv22: Maybe they found a glitch and dont Blizzard to see it...lol
[4:04:18] Bokehhbob: Oooo
[4:04:22] gaffer2202: who got world first
[4:04:29] Arcke87: cmon guys, common sense isn't common I guess
[4:04:30] Kinghorn: blizzard is watching them
[4:04:30] Artivicii: Shade
[4:04:30] Sevendash: Blizzard would see it for sure
[4:04:33] SpoofAvatar: echo not streaming will cause people to question the validity of their strat/klill
[4:04:34] Affiiance: Blizz is watching whether they stream or not lol
[4:04:37] fourseti1234: ya blizz can watch god mod style
[4:04:38] hagmania: it's a good racing decision, but i don't think it's a good business decision
[4:04:40] burfurlur: cyberpunk ad lol
[4:04:40] Aidler: no need to watch echo anymore if they don't live stream. easy
[4:04:45] dwolters_the_zombieman: nobody got it yet
[4:04:47] ThatNavGuy: facts
[4:04:47] Zippaya: one seccond something wrong blizz wipe them
[4:04:53] LSBreed: from everything max has said and what we have seen the difference in strategy hasn't ever been that different. it's mostly about execution.
[4:04:55] Mecabeast: 21st person in raid kekw
[4:04:56] nativej96: so why does it say servers went down at 7 but they didnt? makes so much sense
[4:04:57] Masqerader: they did with N'zoth
[4:05:01] Kinghorn: they are the man behind the curtain
[4:05:01] Antdavs24: how else would blizz be patching mid fight lol theyre obviously watching
[4:05:03] trivwik: Blizz just isn't there to make sure that no one is paying irl cash to try to buy world first
[4:05:07] brain_wash: Won't matter what strat they use when Limit wins it.
[4:05:11] Holysal: just look at the nzoth despawn
[4:05:14] Apokolipz: HyperReveal we are always watching...
[4:05:16] pavepawns: gary from blizzard is hovering above gingi on follow watching their tactics
[4:05:19] LordKain73: If limit wins, get ready for the 16 hour qq from eu again...
[4:05:37] Ceredor1: That's true. Got a server first in Wotlk and a GM popped up, said they had been watching and congratulated us.
[4:05:38] Holysal: @lordkain73 well it was only 8 this time
[4:05:39] ExziledSoul: why are there always so many ads on your steam towelie? its only your stream and no one elses.
[4:05:42] biddy17: biddy17 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak!

[4:06:26] its_andyd: not hard to just log on their server and /who echo
[4:06:34] Bokehhbob: I mean it’s just who can figure out how to deal with surprise mechanics or new mechanics quicker than the other. Their comps are similar enough.
[4:06:42] Dark_lite7: Interesting, isn't sludge and generals going to slow them down again? they are still big pull bosses, right?
[4:06:42] Fierrobert: Considering how council of blood went, that they did the same strategy but limit just executed it better, and everyone was saying that they cheated, its just same strategy most likely with variable execution
[4:06:43] LSBreed: only reason to consider extending is the time generals might take from bugs
[4:06:44] lufty89: echo hunters drop insane deeps
[4:06:47] Kinghorn: they are pussies PrideShrug
[4:06:58] Zestusuka: I enjoy seeing prot warrior being used
[4:07:02] segarth: not happy about not streaming it but i understand since limit has an advantage, and would have a greater one watching them stream
[4:07:05] mmrghost7: ofc they would do that why would give free information
[4:07:12] GnomeLickerGames: for the fact of the race 100% prioritise win over streaming
[4:07:22] Nikione0one: Finally the ad break is over!
[4:07:27] hisdue: LUL
[4:07:28] drunken_werewolf_hunter: @towelliee I worry for sponsors. it doesn't look good for the echo brand being their first rwf.
[4:07:33] TheCliffyShow: People need to get over it. Echo cares more about getting an advantage in the race then entertaining people.
[4:07:36] MammothGB: Echo will do whatever they can to win, that is their priority. If you want to watch from start to finish, then push blizzard to align lockouts
[4:07:39] SpoofAvatar: social media demands it
[4:07:40] SaltyTunapants: limit agreed to their sponsors to stream i imagine
[4:07:43] Hypertitan: correct...but it seems to be "implied" i guess
[4:07:43] I_DoctorSatan_I: If Echo hasn't been to the "mirror phase" then there's no point hiding ur stream from Limit when Limit has been getting to the "secret phase" already. LUL
[4:07:44] Martymartang: their sponsors expect a certain amount of air time
[4:07:45] MammothGB: that gets rid of this artificial advantage
[4:07:46] nativej96: i was in a world first raid back in lich ... never again its to stressful , i felt dead by the end
[4:07:49] CritcobainTV: It's against ToS to not stream the race to world first BabyRage
[4:07:52] CritcobainTV: KEKW
[4:08:01] TheLeguard: They shouldn't be claiming to stream the "race the world first" if they arent streaming
[4:08:05] ne0rmatrix: streaming the first 3 or 4 bosses is nice as they pretty much make that look easy lol
[4:08:06] whispzzz: Karen wants to speak with Echo's GM
[4:08:09] hotguy6packabs: Servers up
[4:08:13] trivwik: They only stream it for the advertisement and sponsorship value.
[4:08:16] Antdavs24: yup
[4:08:18] D3m0nHunt3r666: they will stream once limit wins Kappa
[4:08:25] Hypertitan: I think it sucks cuz if they don't stream and win....Limit is probably going to do the same thing and it won't be as entertaining unfortunately
[4:08:28] GnomeLickerGames: why would they give free info to their comp they didnt put all this work In for streaming they put it in for the tittle of world first
[4:08:29] Deathkanigit101: @Towelliee I will say this Adds are out in force on limits stream.
[4:08:34] SaltyTunapants: if echo wins why would a sponsor, sponsor them next race if they are just going to take it down on last boss?
[4:08:37] Jaizty: kasparas123
[4:08:39] Alienfromger: dont stream wfr in 2020 LUL
[4:08:45] Kinghorn: hotguy6packabs coxStare
[4:08:48] I_DoctorSatan_I: let's be real, Echo mad Limit got WF last year, plain and simple. They want redemption LUL
[4:08:48] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[4:08:51] Hypertitan: I think it sucks for the future of wfr
[4:08:51] Naturalbeef: Man. Echo not even broadcasting progression until tomorrow
[4:08:52] letrickyxd: @Hypertitan Limit literally have to stream with their current sponsors, or they get sued
[4:08:52] thiccsushi: I think limit has an obligation from sponsors compared to echo right now
[4:08:53] captinfluffyz: Has reset happened?
[4:08:55] Antdavs24: mandated streaming clause
[4:08:56] drunken_werewolf_hunter: @towelliee you have 6-7k people and a bunch of people angry over it
[4:09:02] MammothGB: @captinfluffyz NA Yes, EU No
[4:09:04] irlock143: @Towelliee how you feeling about BDGG standing ? i think they are doing pretty good
[4:09:06] Hypertitan: as a viewer of course
[4:09:07] Menisong: How is Shade doing in raid, you happy?
[4:09:13] HaxzorJimDuggan: accidently unplug the stream Kappa
[4:09:17] Boomhauwer: yes limit will lose their money
[4:09:18] ThisTHC: @captinfluffyz is it 11am et yet?
[4:09:18] Masqerader: @Towelliee Well advertising an event and having people sub to your channel/follow for something and not doing it will leave a bad taste in some peoples mouth so it could also backfire
[4:09:19] raldrik: max said he was obligated to
[4:09:21] ImNilzen: Well Limit didnt stream their coucil kill eaither thoo, so why the drama now suddenly
[4:09:21] Antdavs24: id think complexity would be making limit stream for sure
[4:09:25] Mecabeast: imagine if every football game was played like normal but the superbowl was not broadcasted
[4:09:26] segarth: im surprised method is doing so well
[4:09:26] DatRippelEffect: didn't they kill council offstream though?
[4:09:36] Bokehhbob: Limit was blacking out there stream for final phase last night i believe.
[4:09:36] Choowey: THey didnt stream Nzothh 100%
[4:09:37] GIJosh86: @towelliee Max said they were obligated
[4:09:37] catlinv: Reset eta?
[4:09:44] LSBreed: max even consulted complexity before they killed council.
[4:09:46] dwolters_the_zombieman: I'm switching to different device the app on phone is acting up
[4:09:47] darthhelmett: @Towelliee at the end of the day, Limit will WIN! maximumLimit maximumLimit maximumDabbing maximumDabbing
[4:09:48] Screamnsteam: @imnilzen they didn’t mean to kill it though lul, that’s how easy it was
[4:09:57] Aidler: unfortunately echo still has 12k viewers on their not live stream
[4:09:59] excessior: they gonna show when its close to kill
[4:10:01] Naturalbeef: Limit downed one boss offline so they don't have a requirement
[4:10:02] Masqerader: @catlinv assuming no extended next 30m or less
[4:10:06] Alienfromger: its a slap in the face of fans
[4:10:13] wipeologist: @Towelliee is that a WA for the trinket?
[4:10:16] catlinv: @Masqerader Tks man
[4:10:18] drunken_werewolf_hunter: @towelliee that is such a dangerous place to be in as a brand new brand.
[4:10:21] Hypertitan: @letrickyxd I'm talking about future races...max says if Echo doesn't stream the end boss at all that Limit is going to have to rething how they do the race in the future
[4:10:24] conksdaman: i was cheering for echo until they did that shit yesterday. fuck them honestly
[4:10:28] its_andyd: idiots... playing video games just for fun
[4:10:29] Kalitvenec: PixelBob
[4:10:29] DeMigle: Thoughts on the new copyright laws?
[4:10:31] ez_moneyy: SERVERS UP! LETS GOOOO
[4:10:33] UthredTV: UthredTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:10:33] letrickyxd: @Naturalbeef They do have a requirement, Max said they would literally get sued if they don't stream. That was a accident kill
[4:10:35] veryboredguy1: @Naturalbeef yeah after 16 hrs of streaming they did lol
[4:10:36] jason_tacey: towTinfoil towTinfoil what if they both down Sire at the same time :O towTinfoil towTinfoil
[4:10:40] Tickletrain: @Towelliee your the reason im playing prot pally im loving it so far
[4:10:40] thiccsushi: @Naturalbeef That was after them streaming for 16hrs
[4:10:41] Dyasis: @wipeologist yes, Luxthus weak auras
[4:10:45] wackeeeEEE: makin breakfast during reset, huevos rancheros
[4:10:47] viran206: are you on EU?
[4:10:50] Razaku_: yeah folks get ready for a no comms race for 9.1
[4:10:50] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:10:51] segarth: if they win they wont lose a single viewer. as soon as the streams go back up, people will flock back to their streams
[4:10:53] Eperuza_TV: I think they care about WF more than sponsors
[4:10:56] GoGetItKo: fuck him uppppp Towelliee
[4:11:00] DallTV_: could be funn if method win over echo
[4:11:00] burfurlur: lol rogue
[4:11:04] GoGetItKo: yikes 60
[4:11:07] letrickyxd: @Hypertitan Except they are backed by maassive org now, and they would never change the details for that
[4:11:08] irlock143: @Towelliee how are yall doing on yall progression?
[4:11:12] Holysal: in the fans lose which kills the rwf
[4:11:18] Holysal: end
[4:11:18] Mogwaimonk: and the guards were on you
[4:11:20] letrickyxd: @Hypertitan Redbull, Complexity would never accept those terms
[4:11:21] Arcke87: not gonna beat a rogue anyway, they need a serious nerf
[4:11:34] CritcobainTV: @Arcke87 but rogues got nerfed
[4:11:36] Aidler: I'm for Limit now and every viewer should support future live streaming
[4:11:36] I_DoctorSatan_I: MOM! GET THE CAMERA, I BEAT A STRIMMER!! BabyRage
[4:11:39] brimes: Rogues are pretty dumb
[4:11:40] letrickyxd: Echo Esports has no MASSIVE backing, so they can afford to do this offline stuff
[4:11:42] wipeologist: ty @Dyasis
[4:11:42] Poriand: @Arcke87 wrong
[4:11:43] Nikione0one: Rogues have been nerfed, they're fine
[4:11:44] smating: is some realms are up and others are not?
[4:11:46] BearOfLight: We really need an Anima spender for Ony Screen Time.
[4:11:47] microfiend: dude turn war mode off
[4:11:52] Arcke87: Ehh, rogues are worse lol
[4:11:54] hagmania: i'm only upset from an entertainment perspective. totally understand the tactical decision.
[4:11:58] LSBreed: @arcke87 notice the ONLY class not in the wfr....
[4:12:08] wackeeeEEE: rogues need their own instances, let them stealth around each other all expac
[4:12:09] CritcobainTV: @Arcke87 Rogues are worse but all the top teams have WW's or Arms warriors lol
[4:12:11] Eperuza_TV: Echos prefers WF over sponsor money
[4:12:12] nativej96: people dont think logically
[4:12:15] Arcke87: Pvp side, I mean
[4:12:17] sinlesssinner: and you dont believe they do? :p

[4:12:25] Anbean: OTK cover of WFR is kinda bad :/
[4:12:32] Razaku_: man its gonna suck if we have to hear about world first from a tweet LUL
[4:12:35] Hypertitan: Max himself said limit would have to rethink the way they do the race...that doesn't mean they wouldn't stream the last boss...but it might be massively different than what we have right now
[4:12:38] letrickyxd: This World First means a lot more to Echo, cause they have to build themselves up again
[4:12:39] UthredTV: THink they'll turn it back on as soon as Limit reset their lockout
[4:12:43] Screamnsteam: @anbean what do you mean? It’s amazing
[4:12:45] duffluv22: Wonder what cinematics will be at Blizzcon?
[4:12:49] I_DoctorSatan_I: EU mad NA won 4Head
[4:12:54] D3m0nHunt3r666: OTK LUL
[4:12:55] Bazsidiver: clown fiesta
[4:12:56] kylern58: limit is absolutely dominating all the metrics that matter to sponsors by actually staying live
[4:12:57] Voodoochild77: OTK = Cringe
[4:13:00] SaltyTunapants: but they cant win without taking down the stream on last boss, no sponsor will let that in the contract
[4:13:05] Liekabauws: BDGG has been great with presentation
[4:13:05] irlock143: their mini movie clips are funny
[4:13:06] DatRippelEffect: @Anbean what did u expect? we got some hilarious content atleast
[4:13:08] Noglin_: I love pieces :)
[4:13:09] Arcke87: When you can kill most classes in pvp in under 5 secs, somethings gotta change
[4:13:12] Alienfromger: OTK should name Asmon and freinds LUL
[4:13:12] ObsidianHealer: I'm liking OTK's just cause its at lest entertaining.
[4:13:16] Panadol324: otk = asmon just want to promote this otk bullshiet
[4:13:21] SteelEm: OTK is like a washed up stand up comedy thing. idk its off for me
[4:13:21] Spathotan: problem with the OTK coverage is they aren't actually covering the race at all
[4:13:21] AudioJaq: OTK feels slapped together, I like some of those guys, but not super professional
[4:13:23] brain_wash: Mizkif looks like he has a rap sheet, a gross rap sheet
[4:13:27] jxecho9094: Might be kinda hard to get bigger sponsors since echo is basically method. brought all the dirdy laundry with them
[4:13:28] its_andyd: yeah OTK is pretty cringe
[4:13:29] nativej96: alot of the worldfirst guilds are filled with assholes, they dont even get along with each other half the time, i like the lowekey guilds better
[4:13:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: its pretty cringe sometimes imo
[4:13:30] TheCliffyShow: I watched a little of the BigDumbGuiild stream. It was entertaining. And not so busy you can't have a conversation.
[4:13:32] Eperuza_TV: If I were echo, I’d prefer WF over money
[4:13:33] Dragonkiller1974: Dragonkiller1974 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[4:13:36] Fierrobert: An entertaining caster makes everything 10x better
[4:13:39] Screamnsteam: OTK is awesome content, and they cover the relevant parts of the WoW race
[4:13:43] Anbean: @DatRippelEffect i'd like a race coveredge. not some dumb shit
[4:13:46] leshiltv: Hours of attempts on denathrius is not a fun watch either
[4:13:46] microfiend: but you dont really watch it
[4:13:46] sluggn1: World first is probably the worst stream to watch
[4:13:53] irlock143: @Towelliee Love is on fire fire fire
[4:13:57] letrickyxd: @AudioJaq I doubt they will ever be a really professional type thing, which is not a bad thing
[4:13:59] CoreMan510: AFter 70 attempts on a boss, what new commentary could there be to add?
[4:14:02] LarcenousLaugh: My boy Dratnos with the fire coverage
[4:14:03] Eperuza_TV: Raiding is just not a good esport
[4:14:11] holbern5644: They have rich Campbell
[4:14:11] pavepawns: i watch max
[4:14:13] pavepawns: or jeath
[4:14:13] Chrysophylax_I: half the people on OTK dont know anything about retail
[4:14:14] Eperuza_TV: Too many variables
[4:14:14] Dunlop_qc: i dont think thats what they are going for either, i think they are going for a more funny approach
[4:14:15] holbern5644: Lol
[4:14:17] Antdavs24: yea that group is not for coverage, theyre there to make entertainment for sure
[4:14:20] PokerFaceMoose: @sluggn1 you dont like grown men getting mad at each other?
[4:14:22] Aidler: @hypertitan does Max want to make a pay per View event out of the race in the future?
[4:14:23] jagheters: When are us servers up?
[4:14:24] segarth: to be fair, wow coverage can only fill so many hours when you are wiping on a boss for hours
[4:14:26] LoremasterMarthan: Chat, did you know the storm abates for now?
[4:14:27] Arcke87: Well how do nascar commentators do it, they watch cars go in circles for hours
[4:14:33] DatRippelEffect: @Anbean it's asmon, rich, and tips. i think u had your expectations a little too high
[4:14:33] AudioJaq: @letrickyxd While I agree, for THIS sort of thing there should be some professionalism. Your putting on a show for others
[4:14:35] itsNODDERS: how is his channel called=
[4:14:36] itsNODDERS: ?*
[4:14:39] Antdavs24: yea max's channel has been the best to watch
[4:14:40] KNash92: I don't think anyone is watching OTK for their in depth analysis
[4:14:40] Nosusee: OTK doing alright. I cant sit and watch a goup wipe for days on the same boss.
[4:14:41] LSBreed: I feel like they take away from those guilds and teams I'm not a fan of otk
[4:14:41] Hypertitan: max's stream is just chill to watch...that's why I like it
[4:14:43] gorilla_quantistico: you watch otk for the show not for the race
[4:14:47] Alienfromger: there is no otk channel
[4:14:49] MizixTV: OTK is just trying to piggyback off the the RWF name for viewership....
[4:14:49] pavepawns: max and jeath are the best to watch in regards to coverage IMO
[4:14:56] D3m0nHunt3r666: The real coaching stream tastelessPepe
[4:15:00] excessior: realm status lied to me
[4:15:05] leshiltv: OTK has the most views because it's really Asmon's channel
[4:15:08] hagmania: it's just a different angle to coverage
[4:15:08] DDFeeder: @Towelliee do you see method as real contented for WF race for later tiers in this expansion
[4:15:08] sinlesssinner: OTK isnt a pve centered Org :p so they only know so much about raiding
[4:15:10] Arcke87: it didnt lie, hes playing eu
[4:15:11] Fierrobert: I kinda miss preach casting
[4:15:24] healmore49: Max is boring tbh lol
[4:15:25] Anbean: @DatRippelEffect i didn't realise that there will be ALOT of this side stuff bullshit :/ and where didi Nihilum went? Kappa
[4:15:29] thiccsushi: preach casting was so good
[4:15:32] letrickyxd: @AudioJaq I saw some moments of covering the race pretty professionally, but I haven't watch it much, so can't have a big opinion on them atm, but i can take your word
[4:15:40] Liekabauws: agreed
[4:15:41] TheCliffyShow: I found BigDumbGuild's stream entertaining from the bit I saw.
[4:15:45] pavepawns: the one thing i disliked with big dumb guild was the instant cutoff from boss when it died to casters. i kinda wanted to see loot
[4:15:45] kodtheog: otk is ResidentSleeper
[4:15:51] swampt1l: Servers down atm right chat?

[4:16:54] Holysal: @eladarmri bigdumbgaming
[4:16:59] Nosusee: It is hard to take OTK serious as an actual org. It right now comes across as just a bunch of buds doing stuff
[4:17:04] Masqerader: Preach probably through a bunch of dice on the table and said "this is how this raid will play out" @Towelliee

[4:18:38] Antdavs24: lol some of chat hasnt paid taxes yet to learn how to finagle the system Kappa
[4:18:41] ZeusDNA: @mutilator_ Yo
[4:18:42] Nexecutioner: @limsicle streamer privilege
[4:18:42] zaraine1: depends on the person i guess Kappa
[4:18:42] Tonysback: streamers get to play even if servers are down

[4:18:46] Syrion93: @conkersmanxx Hacks
[4:18:51] KNash92: Sco's channel has more viewers than Echo so I'd say Method is still relevant with viewers
[4:18:56] Masqerader: Pieces is the only real wildcard
[4:18:59] leshiltv: Generals got nerfed
[4:19:10] sinlesssinner: Method being top 5 is already a win imo
[4:19:10] zaraine1: sweet child o mine ooof
[4:19:16] PToastman: I suppose it's nice to see them cooperate Kappa
[4:19:29] Kneckt: KEKW

[4:19:42] zaraine1: Pieces?
[4:19:42] sinlesssinner: there is ALOT of guilds raiding dude
[4:19:42] Limsicle: pieces
[4:19:43] CallThatReal: @knash92 I think that's cause a lot more people are more interested in an underdog/rebuild story
[4:19:44] itsamochatree: Yo how are you playing right now haha. Secret streamer servers, i knewwwww iiitttt

[4:20:04] sinlesssinner: what other guilds is there for NA, just limit...
[4:20:05] Cypfer: they only have BoE agents
[4:20:10] kylern58: EU is just waiting for the NA servers and Limit to go live like the rest of us
[4:20:11] psycothedruid: people actually enjoy him haha
[4:20:17] Tamahauk1588: Suprised Method has any following after the Josh stuff. I refuse to watch Method ever again after what they tried to cover up.
[4:20:19] DatRippelEffect: its fun watching joker's pov since it's his first rwf
[4:20:20] murtokqt: NA doesnt have 2nd guild for rwf
[4:20:24] mutilator_: you think they beat it today, with vault items and reset? is it just gear holding them back still, or ironing out the mechanics
[4:20:29] hisdue: maximumLipgob private RTM

[4:21:33] leshiltv: TBC had the best end game
[4:21:33] veryboredguy1: @TheCrackerG what did they cover up?
[4:21:34] JayBinski: Private servers were better
[4:21:38] A_Klimas: all the classic folks were already like "wheres tbc?" before nexx even came out
[4:21:38] Cypfer: TBC comes out, then they should do Classic 2.0 and let's do everything all over again
[4:21:38] Spykex02: They probably released them at the same time on purpose to prove a point
[4:21:38] Ckn1ght: private servers did it better tbh
[4:21:39] murtokqt: FSY is eu guild @kazreth_
[4:21:39] jason_tacey: yeah Esfand is set on the announcement coming at blizzcon

[4:22:05] Bazsidiver: phase 2 was shit
[4:22:05] leshiltv: Sunwell was amazing
[4:22:06] Hobo_Stream: I enjoyed classic for what it brought back...community - WoW today is just missing that piece quite a bit.
[4:22:07] segarth: @Kazreth_ FSY is in EU tho
[4:22:08] DarkenedHour97: im low key hypedc for WOLK
[4:22:09] Poriand: arena will be huge in BC
[4:22:11] Tamahauk1588: @Martziie I dont think the players really knew, Josh had manipulated them into believing it was all false. But you still take those type of alligations serious enough to do more than they did.
[4:22:12] Arcke87: WOTLK best xpac
[4:22:15] SorionTheGinger: bc will have that @Towelliee Kappa
[4:22:18] GoGetItKo: Flying mounts in TBC :O
[4:22:20] Hypertitan: i think tbc will be the same honestly....
[4:22:20] Sielu11628: X.1 patches have been announced WAY quicker last 3 expansions. BlizzconOnline is perfect, but WAY TOO LONG compared to previous expacs. Google it!
[4:22:21] bossmanreuben: "only classic matters" lmao
[4:22:21] LSBreed: wrath baby
[4:22:23] annoying_jay: TBC best xpac of all time come fight me on Isle of Quel danas idiots
[4:22:23] maccaruso: Why do you say Classic was a flop? There are still a lot of active players
[4:22:24] Artivicii: if you didnt think BC was great, you probably didnt get pass gruuls lair KEKW
[4:22:26] pawgmoth: More than 1 viable tank, BC will live longer
[4:22:36] DevelopmentTeam: i got no hopes on method anymore after seeing josh for what case happen at all. Sadge EU for the lose
[4:22:38] Atokiri: Memories of Rogue tanking gruul lair oh no
[4:22:40] Mecabeast: bc will have faction balance issues worse than classic imo

[4:22:54] hisdue: new world boss, new extended
[4:23:00] thiccsushi: this week should be sanguine quaking

[4:25:08] NILLme: proffessions, fast pvp
[4:25:18] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee What about alliance ganking you at flight paths? that's just like classic LUL
[4:25:19] Atokiri: even the level 60 feels diferent
[4:25:20] sluggin6780: Max 60
[4:25:24] ThisTHC: WutFace
[4:25:25] PRlCKLYPETE: classic vibes? you mean the stat squish and 60 cap?
[4:25:32] Lexi__Marie: Thoon
[4:25:33] Nosusee: Shadowlands feels more like Wrath and classic
[4:25:34] kharditv: Thoon
[4:25:38] pheras_: you drunk
[4:25:49] annoying_jay: shadowlands thus far, is an all around better expansion than bfa was by lightyears
[4:25:50] XpoZe: You think you can make money from enchanting?
[4:25:51] zaraine1: it was fast pvp back then not now LUL
[4:25:53] Arcke87: shadowmelded aimed shots yo!
[4:25:55] A_Klimas: Def kept me subbed during bfa, I'll give classic that. AQ sucked tho.
[4:25:57] Yurian33: F for frost mages :(
[4:25:58] Roobi_doobi: DRs being a thing in pvp will be great for BC
[4:26:03] segarth: @Towelliee how´s your mythic progression going?
[4:26:22] Buckwink: its great, only casuals dont like it
[4:26:23] thiccsushi: Once the .1 patch comes should be a good indicator for shadowlands
[4:26:25] casualboomer: The lack of loot has cost me about 1M gold in BoEs
[4:26:28] xavier2119: shit im still making hella money lmfao not as good as the first couple weeks but damn
[4:26:28] Arcke87: I hate the very slow gearing process lol
[4:26:32] Cypfer: there's so much gear with m+s
[4:26:36] BearOfLight: WoD had one of the best leveling experiences to date imo.
[4:26:36] CritcobainTV: WoD was great until BRF came out and then it just fell off hard
[4:26:39] annoying_jay: i thought they made gearing easier now?
[4:26:42] GrimmStalkR: Garrisons were trash
[4:26:42] Riakuu: I really enjoy the slower gearing process. Makes me actually want to run M+ multiple times a week
[4:26:43] Baron_Atrox: @Towelliee 9.1 will be when people either stick around or leave, thats what happened in BFA, many people quit in 8.1 or soon before
[4:26:44] maccaruso: All I know is I'm enjoying Shadowlands and Classic both are really fun.
[4:26:45] Nosusee: more like Wrath THAN classic***
[4:26:45] annoying_jay: w/ m+ farming
[4:26:46] pheras_: i mean gearing slowly gives theexp more longlivity imo
[4:26:46] KonradGM: i remember when during first two weeks of Wod you mentioned you felt it was best expqac since Wrath LUL
[4:26:47] Arcke87: Yeah but not everyone can do M+'s
[4:26:47] BustaphaJones: yerrr
[4:26:52] daddy_dolby: M+ would had made WoD better for the casuals, we have that now
[4:26:52] Buckwink: if you want gear git gud and time keys
[4:26:55] sluggin6780: I ran sanguine depths all yesterday and still can’t replace my 171 cloak.. good times
[4:26:59] NILLme: not getting gear? well then just wait for Season 2 for eazy gear catchup LUL
[4:27:00] zaraine1: i just hate that ppl wont invite you in mythic cuz of playing warr
[4:27:01] BearOfLight: @annoying_jay They made it targetable but fewer drops
[4:27:09] Masqerader: @Poondog don't need to time them though
[4:27:12] CritcobainTV: @sluggin6780 just pvp and upgrade the cloak to 184. Derp
[4:27:12] WillWiley: this week should be much more forgiving for keys
[4:27:15] casualboomer: @Arcke87 I pushed io all week. As a vengeance DH. Can confirm most people in pugs have no business in M+
[4:27:16] xavier2119: @sluggin6780 it feels so good doesn't it
[4:27:18] kodtheog: i dont get it how can people say gear is low im having no issues
[4:27:19] BostonGrump: Shadowlands is better than BFA at this point, but SL has some serious glaring issues
[4:27:21] Buckwink: @Masqerader more gear drops if you time it
[4:27:21] Detentes: I actually like the slow gearing, it makes you want to keep playing a character at a high level instead of having 12 alts, but that's my preference not everyone
[4:27:22] hagmania: i'm super excited for the Riot MMO - I think it winds up with more longevity than the FF14
[4:27:22] duavious: What’s towellie wife’s name again?
[4:27:24] BearOfLight: @annoying_jay and removed titanforging making BiS actually possible
[4:27:26] maccaruso: There is a LOT of warrior hate in Shadowlands right now
[4:27:28] WillWiley: last week's affixes were cancer
[4:27:30] annoying_jay: i think if any1 here is having a hard time gearing its cuz ur not farming m+ enough
[4:27:33] Affiiance: I do feel like if you play the whole game this isnt an alt friendly expansion
[4:27:36] kodtheog: @Detentes i also agree
[4:27:42] Masqerader: @Poondog 1 piece and if its a conduit, whoopy
[4:27:45] sluggin6780: @critcobain I hate pvp and I’m 184 doesn’t cut it I run m plus
[4:27:46] I_DoctorSatan_I: 5 man dun grps, 2 ppl get loot. Math is hard. You might not be the one to get loot. You win some, you lose some eShrug
[4:27:47] Arcke87: Thats because M+ isnt where casuals belong and it sucks cause thats where the gear is
[4:27:52] its_andyd: damn i have mad gas

[4:28:14] duncon: still rocking a 161 neck. can't get anything to drop.
[4:28:15] Affiiance: They just need to turn Torghast into a way Casuals can gear
[4:28:22] Detentes: I went from 184 to 197 on boomkin in like 3 days. It's not really that bad, sure I probably got lucky
[4:28:23] A_Klimas: May all your chests have upgrades
[4:28:25] pheras_: what worldboss this week anyone know ?
[4:28:31] Crisis88: @Shoez What do you play?
[4:28:32] Lexi__Marie: Fortified, Spiteful, Grievous, Prideful!
[4:28:33] gorilla_quantistico: thank god storming is gone for a while
[4:28:34] Arroneous: why not gear with pvp gear then just upgrade it
[4:28:36] Alliewh33lz: 22 MTHICS last week... only one drop..
[4:28:37] Fierrobert: @duncon you should do pvp, just for honor
[4:28:37] aumixp: Oof spiteful and greavous as affixes @towelliee
[4:28:39] kodtheog: the only thing i would like them to stop doing is droping the same conduits once you already have at least give us more anima if we aint gonna get loot
[4:28:41] steelreign0080: I'm still stuck with my 171 weapon and everything else is 190+ lol

[4:28:42] zaraine1: just buff warr so i can get in groups
[4:28:48] nerefwow: @duncon I got a 171 hc bracer with a socket and I can't even replace it with +8 gear :D
[4:28:51] Yurian33: frost mage too pls
[4:28:52] Masqerader: @pheras_ only 2 choices from the list of 4 lol
[4:28:56] biirrd: Kinda like the "slow" gear progress, that make so the 7-8-9 keys are still fun for a while. untill you only do keys for get it done. and not for gear
[4:28:57] NILLme: @duncon farm honor? buy 1 and upgrade
[4:29:00] Masqerader: @pheras_ its random
[4:29:03] Affiiance: Torghast gearing for casuals could help I think
[4:29:04] gorilla_quantistico: is spiteful still melee unfriendly?
[4:29:07] excessior: i want to see 9 cloaks in vault
[4:29:07] ewigeslicht: its been rough gearing so far. did 12 mythic keys and 10/10 and got 2 pieces.
[4:29:07] Buckwink: thats how vanilla was
[4:29:08] jxecho9094: Unless you pvp, then you can upgrade that shit to 226
[4:29:11] Tamahauk1588: Most people are already considered "geared" for this whole patch... just play the game 4heads.
[4:29:18] Kneckt: I diddnt get my hunter lego last night after a mythic. heroic and normal of the same boss back to back
[4:29:19] Ezekyler: Fortified, Spiteful and Grievous this week @Towelliee
[4:29:20] thiccsushi: I didnt get a single piece of loot from normal and heroic raid last week it sucked
[4:29:23] oraclespyro: ewww
[4:29:23] duncon: yea i just don't pvp :(
[4:29:23] Karbonn: @Towelliee 24 plaguefall Mythic+'s and no trinket drop ;.;
[4:29:25] annoying_jay: just dont suck 4head Kappa
[4:29:25] ch0ller: what is max renown before reset?

[4:29:32] gringogato: NotLikeThis
[4:29:32] honkblarg: killed 9 bosses and didn't get loot from any of them
[4:29:35] runlikeboop: 12
[4:29:41] ch0ller: thanks
[4:29:41] Carryout: LOL the RNG this expac sucks, I still have a 155 weapon because they dont drop
[4:29:41] Paladine_Dragonslayer: Ive got everydamn 171 mail shoe there is..seems to be all that drops for me
[4:29:43] Affiiance: Thats what im saying, give them gear in Torghast that way casuals have some way to get gear
[4:29:45] Holysal: this what we wanted. now bath in it
[4:29:46] casualboomer: Casuals + Torghast OMEGALUL all general chat in Torghast has in it is casuals complaining their class can't do it
[4:29:47] excessior: just dont invite melee
[4:29:48] Nosusee: Rich get richer... and the Poor get richer.. most "poor" have iphones
[4:29:49] Masqerader: but everyone complained to much loot, and wf/tf ruined the game, blizzard took care of it and now...
[4:29:53] Horsies65: when is the reset for NA? 10 mins?
[4:29:54] Artivicii: all dps should be ranged 4Head
[4:29:54] vintersorgSA: yeah i got fuck all from the raid - feelsbadman
[4:29:56] drakbro: they nerf plaguefall, spires, and theatre so
[4:29:58] I_DoctorSatan_I: Spiteful + Fortified, thats worse
[4:30:00] bad_fish_too: I'm ok. With where I'm at/ I'm not going hardcore this expac.
[4:30:03] kodtheog: @casualboomer Lmao tru
[4:30:04] zaraine1: as a solo cant get in a raid group yet cuz of the class
[4:30:04] GameSlayer_TV: towBleedpurple_SA
[4:30:04] Arcke87: Had to blow 200k on a 190 ilvl weapon cause I didn't wait to wait for the 2+ months of not having a great weapon
[4:30:07] Fierrobert: @duncon neither do i, usually, but just doing epic BG will just reward you plenty of honor, and you will eventually get neck 184
[4:30:08] vintersorgSA: your rich ingame lol
[4:30:08] Thirtys3v3n: When you work a 9 - 5, got kids and your time is limited to play and you have been at it for a month and have got zero progression, you say fuck it, I'm out.
[4:30:08] critin87: 
[4:30:10] runlikeboop: reset was 50 min ago
[4:30:10] NILLme: another fun week for melee
[4:30:15] casualboomer: Torghast isn't hard if you respect the trash and understand roguelike games. If you don't do both of those, Torghast is painful
[4:30:16] michiganbrownie: literally the only reason i have a 180 weapon is because i managed to catch the sorrowbane wq
[4:30:17] reinhardtdog: I'm always fine having weaker gear than those running higher keys / mythic raid etc. But I miss getting gear. I miss the RNG some.
[4:30:20] Dragonkiller1974: loot is a myth prove me wrong
[4:30:24] MOLAR305: bring back justice badges
[4:30:28] KNash92: My problem with Torgahst isn't difficulty. It's just boring. Clearing trash packs for 5 floors to kill a boss isn't that fun.
[4:30:29] maccaruso: I'm leveling an affliction lock now because warriors don't get M+ invites.
[4:30:29] ObsidianHealer: @casualboomer very true
[4:30:30] hagmania: i love the gearing experience, it has kept me invested in the game instead of just a theme park type playthrough
[4:30:36] gorilla_quantistico: i did 5 keys this week and 0 loot
[4:30:38] vintersorgSA: towGold
[4:30:42] xavier2119: gold and anima
[4:30:45] Mattsta: towGold
[4:30:45] xavier2119: me all day
[4:30:45] pooranoia: im 206 just doingm+ fuck buying gear
[4:30:47] gringogato: sounds like molten core all over again
[4:30:47] Rakim88: had to trade DansGame not to les tho Kappa
[4:30:49] Karbonn: towGold towGold towGold
[4:30:52] ObsidianHealer: @casualboomer but iLvl does help alot
[4:30:52] Recording_on_the_grass: do your own key if u dont get invites
[4:30:52] Horsies65: gold and anime power
[4:30:53] swampt1l: all about the gold
[4:30:53] beers_lol: enema monkaGIGA
[4:30:57] bertooso: True
[4:30:57] Slicerv: The game loves to tease you loot one week then take it away the next weeks
[4:30:57] vintersorgSA: im 194 and like.... ive put too much time in lol
[4:30:58] Carryout: yes it is
[4:30:59] JeffreyVegas: torghast needs the endless mode
[4:31:00] Xomezor: I did a +6 on a paladin last night just for the one piece from vault
[4:31:01] xxanders: i did 9 keys in a row 4 of them were anima
[4:31:04] Boomhauwer: towGold towGold towGold towGold towGold
[4:31:04] steelreign0080: atleast they could up it form fucking 35 anima lol
[4:31:05] PidiaP: 35 Anima per boss kill KEKW
[4:31:05] BearOfLight: My Great Vault was trash last week. Literally 3 pairs of pants - and my lego is on my pants.
[4:31:05] chiakong: i got one piece in 20 bosses
[4:31:10] Arcke87: Nope, even if I did M+, still wouldn't get a weapon
[4:31:10] Bitterra: @Towelliee what do you think about conduits? it feels like there's only one or two viable conduits for each spec and the rest are basically useless
[4:31:11] LoremasterMarthan: As a casual, gearing right now is a fucking nightmare. I have to try and make time for the highest M+ key and hope for a good drop from the vault
[4:31:13] jason_tacey: need a TowAnima emote R)
[4:31:14] Masqerader: I have earned more anima in this channel than total in game atm
[4:31:15] casualboomer: @ObsidianHealer I cleared layer 6 below 200 ilvl. I CARRIED 8s at that level
[4:31:18] xxanders: and the reset were no loot
[4:31:19] Karbonn: @BearOfLight Bear tank?
[4:31:20] Webw0lf359: friends PepeHands
[4:31:20] duncon: i figured my best bet was to complain about it in a chat because as soon as realms open a neck will in the chest this week :D
[4:31:21] Arcke87: woulda gotten gloves or boots that were a nominal upgrade
[4:31:22] vintersorgSA: this is gonna bite Blizz in the ass in a month or so
[4:31:23] annoying_jay: i just farm m+ i get a piece maybe 1 out of 4 dungeons.
[4:31:24] The_Katana_Spamer: @xxanders did 5 yesterday, got nothing, feel your pain bro
[4:31:29] Fibus: i have 4 characters between 178 and 186 because i have an alt problem
[4:31:29] Artivicii: true, im gonna flop soon
[4:31:30] Buckwink: then the game isnt for them
[4:31:31] NILLme: bring back valor points and vendors...
[4:31:33] casualboomer: This is going to burn casuals out HARD if they don't buff loot
[4:31:33] ctrium: No loot PepeHands
[4:31:37] placeholderx: Anima and gold is pain when you don't get loot at all for a whole week of raiding and mythics 😭
[4:31:43] casualboomer: 3-6 weeks tops, and the concurrent users will be DOWN
[4:31:44] aikopooh: i did 4 +4s and got 0 loot
[4:31:45] ObsidianHealer: @casualboomer I did layer 8 as a 175 j4kThumbsUp was easier at 180 though
[4:31:47] leshiltv: I hate gear inflation I'm glad it's less
[4:31:47] its_andyd: another exodus
[4:31:47] Razaku_: great vault is essentially a bread line now but for gear LUL
[4:31:49] tetrahydridodinitrogen: Did 10/10 CN this week 0 drops
[4:31:53] jxecho9094: I like the new gear system, i hate when they throw loot for everything you do.
[4:31:53] Wulfgrym: @Towelliee i have been working alot and im only 170-180 on my two toons and im not sure i can keep up getting like 1 piece of gear a week
[4:31:54] akiimbo_sliice: yeh did 10 mythic runs and LFR raid. 0 loot. sucks.
[4:31:54] MOLAR305: bring back justice badges or valor badges
[4:31:55] pooranoia: oh man lets not start on how many trinkets ive seen drop before I got mine
[4:31:56] Poriand: i give it another month
[4:31:56] Crisis88: The loot scarcity is so stupid for Mythic+. If you do a +3 chest run, everyone should at least get 1 piece
[4:31:59] Cypfer: I got 0 loot in 5 m9s LuL
[4:32:01] excessior: its still the honeymoon period, ppl gonna quit soon
[4:32:06] Buckwink: the everyday casual player wont unsub
[4:32:07] DaProfit: nah more and more conquest every week too
[4:32:08] onehandmostly: do other peoples keys not count towards vault?
[4:32:08] Affiiance: They will break down and give everyone a gear cathup mechanic next patch
[4:32:08] michiganbrownie: yeah i feel stuck at around 180 rn
[4:32:09] Atokiri: people bitched about WF and TF and corruption
[4:32:09] vintersorgSA: @Crisis88 agreed!
[4:32:09] saini311088: Yep already burning out
[4:32:13] kharditv: and so the sub dropping
[4:32:13] I_DoctorSatan_I: And when ppl get sick and tired of not gear progressing their mains, they will turn to their alts for a "fresh" experience.
[4:32:14] HoFChaos: back at launch of the game I ran UBRS 40+ waiting for my lightforge chest to drop :(
[4:32:19] annoying_jay: UP
[4:32:19] toobaked1987: 31 mythic +. 6 pieces of loot.
[4:32:19] Skylin3r: towHAMUP towHAMUP towHAMUP
[4:32:20] annoying_jay: WE UP
[4:32:21] meegs22: servers up
[4:32:21] casualboomer: @ObsidianHealer I'm a 206 Vengeance DH. I've had my baseline haste end up at 57% and proc'd 112% haste. ANYTHING is easy with 112% haste :D
[4:32:22] BEARsmack: The loot system is making me want to quit. I am struggling to find a reason (my alts have no chance). I want to play casually, I don't have time. I am not elite. My GF Alliewh33lz ran 21 mythics for 1 loot.
[4:32:22] bertooso: I thought Alts would be better and they are a little but then you have torghast and lack of heat gear
[4:32:22] bookooti: Ya i got 1 piece of loot in 10 runs
[4:32:22] Shiftymac32: reamls up
[4:32:23] Bazsidiver: just buy loot runs 4Head

[4:32:25] Hymae: @Towelliee Servers Up
[4:32:26] annoying_jay: ha
[4:32:26] A_Klimas: yeah the hour investment for the gear will drop casuals off, m+ aint easy and if you get nothing even if you are grinding 15s its gonna sour folks
[4:32:27] kushimotoo: Servers are up, re-log
[4:32:27] PToastman: I'm a LFR raider and I am upset I have to wait two more weeks for wing 2 to open
[4:32:28] Riakuu: @Towelliee I think if they kept it like this for first 4-5 weeks of each raid tier it would work. Then after that time then loot drop chances went up until the next tier
[4:32:28] zaraine1: same giving it another month, if i cant get in groups cuz im playing a warr im done
[4:32:30] sinlesssinner: i am 200 ilvl and i am not raiding or anything, just doing m+ and casual pvp
[4:32:30] CritcobainTV: ITS UP
[4:32:31] Skylin3r: Morning

[4:32:34] Choowey: up
[4:32:36] Fisch317: favorite dps to have in m+?
[4:32:39] MessyZerg: i wanted to quit the game a few days ago. no loot after whole day of playing.
[4:32:42] hooliggan: I super prefer the lack of random titanforging
[4:32:42] jason_tacey: 178 and stuck
[4:32:45] I_DoctorSatan_I: towJesus towJesus towJesus
[4:32:47] sinlesssinner: while you with all that effort u are only 9 to 10 ilvls ahead :p
[4:32:48] codefiveone: although the xpac is good now, i suspec this one will be the worst yet over the long haul
[4:32:49] 91Niki: @Towelliee I do like the fact that there is a cap on gear. So you can get all your bis and be done with it. I like the feeling of your character feeling complete. But I do hope they will give you higher gear for m+
[4:32:51] fourseti1234: good luck!
[4:32:52] gorilla_quantistico: pvp gives a lot of loot tho
[4:32:52] Shrenko: F
[4:32:53] segarth: Great Vault Pog
[4:32:54] stormsilver42: can ya check which wb is up por favor?
[4:32:56] sinlesssinner: so i d say i am ok with that, no one is going to cry about loot
[4:32:59] xvstormvx: whats in the box??
[4:33:00] excessior: shield
[4:33:03] ObsidianHealer: @casualboomer did it as a Holy Pally cause I'm insane perma wings and hammers of wrath all day
[4:33:04] TuMiBo: @Towelliee yup ure right but PVP gearing is kinnda appealing :D and fun
[4:33:09] Arcke87: Just give us tokens for everything so we choose what gear we get, instead of rng
[4:33:15] Carryout: @Towelliee I only got to run a maybe 7ish 8s 9s M+ got 2 loot both cloaks
[4:33:16] Aidler: my goal as a casual is to reach ilvl 185 - 190 in 1 or 2 month
[4:33:16] BEARsmack: I hope they fix the gear because if they don't within two months, I am taking a break.
[4:33:17] 91Niki: Oh for sure
[4:33:20] luckfore: luckfore subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[4:33:29] michiganbrownie: i think just making weekly quests/events like the 4m0 quest that gives a piece of heroic gear more frequently is a good alternative for casual players like me
[4:33:29] excessior: too soon
[4:33:30] Strayer_J: @gorilla_quantistico no it doesnt lol.. you can get one piece of conq gear a week (if that) and honor gear caps at 184 unitl renown 22

[4:33:40] 91Niki: Yeah I agree on m+
[4:33:40] kryston: Maybe they choose make the drop rate match the difficulty. Lower gets more (lower ilvl gear) just to get atleast started
[4:33:45] DaProfit: @Strayer_J but you upgrade conquest with honor
[4:33:46] NILLme: good luck getting your BIS list with this low drop rates
[4:33:48] Jynt334: Towelliee, I also got my Yeti x WoW Mic Last night!

[4:34:20] BlackForestWilliam: And by then, the next raid tier is out LUL
[4:34:22] TheCliffyShow: What does Towelliee's hat say?

[4:35:02] sinlesssinner: lol we ll see
[4:35:04] TheCliffyShow: @Ralykx Thanks! No clue what that means.
[4:35:07] maryjninja: ye my guild cleared normal just barely and got no loot. So we probs have to wait a long time before trying heroic
[4:35:14] TuesdayLTE: I think that the reason was to decrease the level of which are ppl capable push.. meaning you can't push 25+ keys in like month since season begins which is BS IMHO @Towelliee
[4:35:15] vintersorgSA: i hope i can get above 200 this week
[4:35:21] sinlesssinner: yesterday ppl that farm raider io were having trouble with 14s

[5:27:19] fourseti1234: lol @Drakenking well i understand
[5:27:36] andycoin99: @towelliee you gotta figure out which color unlocks the chain for all four chains and remember
[5:27:43] Drakenking: @fourseti1234 I have a 200 and 190 ilvl weapon thus far
[5:27:58] wolathus: Do you think a 220 piece with no bis stats but is replacing a 194 piece is better then a bis ring at 213 that would replace a 213 ring with wrong stats so no ilevel upgrade on the ring but bis stats on the ring and no bis stats on the 220 piece
[5:27:58] gfield2k: Nah just wanted to hear your thoughts on that @Towelliee ?
[5:28:00] gmo2000: @towelliee will you have a elf this year

[5:29:05] Molvonos: Bring on the 18 floors, I love Torg
[5:29:11] Scruffy_Robot: I can't wait to see what kind of damage 18 floors of powers can get my character to do
[5:29:15] LekeroleN: So bionicbeaver35 you want to punch a baby and THEN do 18 floors? Kappa
[5:29:15] SorionTheGinger: @Towelliee and idea when the 18 floor thorghast will be released? like experience from beta?
[5:29:18] TheRiwen: i rather run 40 miles then do torghast
[5:29:24] casualboomer: I just had 89% haste on my DH in torghast. what's not to love?
[5:29:28] Daggerstry: Wait.... we really have to wait 3 weeks for the second wing of LFR?
[5:29:35] saini311088: What the awards for 18 lvls of thorghast
[5:29:37] Bedpan_BoB: I feel that though, Torgast is hela boring.

[5:29:48] TarMonA: Nice

[5:29:54] Enitzu: they've already said the 18 floor torghast will unlock via bolvars quest chain so probably when its done
[5:30:00] LekeroleN: He dug graves well Kappa
[5:30:04] royhandlesit: digs graves

[5:30:54] Paladine_Dragonslayer: blizz gotta drag that "content" out
[5:30:55] xideontv: so we never save anduin?
[5:31:18] TheRiwen: torghast is just not fun

[5:31:23] gfield2k: I'm doing it mainly for the Maw mounting
[5:31:34] zaraine1: doing some BDSM wiht sylvanas
[5:31:37] Voidheim: I absolutely love Torghast
[5:31:46] BurtMacklin410: it just sucks that its gated per character per week. so people who are behind wont get twisting corridor with everyone else
[5:31:55] Daggerstry: Torghast was fun. Then I had to try to solo layer 6 as a BM hunter
[5:31:57] CDubTheRIPper: I bet varian will be with anduin Kappa
[5:31:57] WaymanLive: What are m+ affixes this week?
[5:31:59] moejimbo: super fun as a venthyr blood dk
[5:32:08] Zippaya: only thing not fun for me is fury warriors are bad everything else is great so far :D
[5:32:15] viopoppinoff: Torghast is fun until you die because you are stupid like me..
[5:32:27] Artivicii: DARKNESS
[5:32:53] TarMonA: more buttons pls Kappa
[5:32:58] KonradGM: Torghast isn't really that fun, it would be with more variety in traits and floor design, like i wish there were more wacky traits instead of boring stat increase ones
[5:33:03] soggyravioli: Coming back to WoW after a bit of a hiatus, I'm loving Torghast. Not entirely sure what the hate is for it.

[5:34:28] DrogoandKhaleesi: Which lego are you using
[5:34:30] saini311088: means 30 sec cd
[5:34:30] nikaliasr: Do you mind showing your talents rq? I would like to learn a bit of a prot pally build
[5:34:34] MechanicalMelee: I love that bar colour
[5:34:45] Bayne77: 30 sec on forbearance so ...
[5:34:48] Urebaldd: Urebaldd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yee hawww
[5:35:03] Reklusion: Twisting corridors should have been hard, not the grab your legendary shit and be done version.
[5:35:05] Mecabeast: did you see discord had an update for community servers to force people to read the specific servers rules
[5:35:09] casualboomer: The players are crybabies
[5:35:17] TheRiwen: all floors looks the same and feel the same
[5:35:17] Molvonos: The whiney vocal minority
[5:35:28] metavahn231: they didnt even nerf the last boss of PF lol
[5:35:50] Alienfromger: but why
[5:35:57] Arocian: absolutely, if 99% of their subscriptions can't complete a majority of the content, will get nerfed
[5:36:02] zaraine1: its not a minority
[5:36:11] Xanothis: I ran a 7 Spires last night, that was rough...
[5:36:16] Molvonos: For Torg?
[5:36:21] laughing_octopus: wake is bad last week
[5:36:34] Daggerstry: 7 Mists yesterday was interesting
[5:36:36] Urebaldd: I stay away from de other side on high mythic ngl
[5:36:40] pukerud: they hopfull look at real data and not screaming kids
[5:36:43] Masqerader: @Molvonos idk man, try the 2nd boss on tyrannical in necrotic wake at 15 and tell me its fun, it wasn't
[5:37:00] Ookagari_: i saw my Wake key last week and went Nope
[5:37:09] Sincline387: No Casuals=No Wow and blizzard knows it. They don't base their decisions off forum posts, they make them off metrics and if people stop doing things they need to fix it
[5:37:21] pukerud: Yeah , real data :)
[5:37:28] metavahn231: blizz stopped listening to neckbeards a looong time ago
[5:37:44] KonradGM: people often use vocal minority when they want to dimminish legitimate criticism they dont aggree with, not always but often
[5:37:56] TarMonA: feared off the side Kappa
[5:38:25] RunningOutOfRAM: lul
[5:38:32] crashoverride_gaming: Not trying to be a dock but I remember a time you didn’t complete something you didn’t complete it. Try again. In pvp you lose, you lose.
[5:38:45] thiccsushi: Tyrannical is not a fun week
[5:38:47] RunningOutOfRAM: I did asention for 1 hour LUL
[5:38:53] connnelkiely: tyrannical sucks so bad
[5:38:57] heavenscloud1517: Necrotic Wake was a little overtuned imo but that was the only one
[5:39:02] wolathus: Tyrannical least fun thing to ever happen to wow, such a waste of time
[5:39:08] casualboomer: I had a slow M+ start week one and had to push io while pugging on tyrannical week
[5:39:08] Reklusion: Fort+tyr are boring, I would prefer a seasonal afix @ level 2 and 10.
[5:39:09] Ookagari_: what should they replace it with ?
[5:39:09] Sincline387: @crashoverride_gaming That's a great theory, be hardcore....like wildstar

[5:39:12] casualboomer: 100% agree overtuned
[5:39:15] Zippaya: the music makes me cry
[5:39:16] Maydie6066: @Towelliee first area of Necrotic Wake is a pain in the ass, my guild had like 7 keys for NW and ran 0 of them
[5:39:20] Yuluthu: once you work out the pulls, all tyrannical really does is change where you lust
[5:39:22] metavahn231: tyran should increase the damage but not the health
[5:39:27] D3m0nHunt3r666: ppl couldn't get 2nd and 3rd boss appropiately for the most part last week
[5:39:28] Molvonos: The problems with the dungeons and tuning, I agree with. Necrotic Wake and Sanguine Depths (2nd/3rd bosses) were ridiculous.
[5:39:39] Molvonos: With Tyrannical
[5:39:46] Masqerader: I mean the 2nd boss in Necrotic Wake on tyrannical felt like a 3 minute enrage timer with ridiculous ramp up lol
[5:39:50] KronasKG: Can you change the stats of a lego?
[5:39:54] Mecabeast: there are certain mob packages that need a good healer to survive in pugs
[5:40:12] Mecabeast: packs*
[5:40:21] codefiveone: the player base needs to accept casual players and foster their betterment in-game, a lot of casual players want to participate but feel held back
[5:40:21] Karbonn: Plaguefall trash is EZ imo
[5:40:22] zaraine1: PF trash got some traumas of that
[5:40:33] fourseti1234: @chat where can i see these changes?
[5:40:39] connnelkiely: saguine second boss makes me never wanna do that gungeon
[5:40:43] metavahn231: prob because sanguine is way easier on fortified
[5:40:45] michiganbrownie: the SD boss absolutely clapped my cheeks for like an hour last night
[5:40:46] josh8555: I forgot to do weekly mythic for quest lmao feelsbadman
[5:40:49] LoremasterMarthan: As someone who has only pushed to like +6 with keys, what exactly is the issue happening with Sanguine Depths 2nd boss? just curious
[5:40:56] Karbonn: idk why people say plaguefall is so bad, i've done it a bunch of times. Only bad when people don't klnow wtf they're doing.
[5:40:58] casualboomer: Probably ton of people running SD because of weapon drops
[5:41:02] Mecabeast: the horror of people trying to do skips in plague after more tentacles were added
[5:41:04] Bedpan_BoB: @fourseti1234 everywhere
[5:41:06] RhadigarTV: Good morning @Towelliee and chat

[5:42:05] metavahn231: the add needs a big ol nerf
[5:42:11] mrniceguy817: My only big complaint as a casual is loot running 20 m+ and get two drops of loot both bracers isn’t fun
[5:42:14] metavahn231: i tod the add LUL
[5:42:40] Masqerader: get castigated and dead before u know it
[5:42:44] Rictamar: a casual who does 20 m+?? I must be super casual then

[5:44:13] Rictamar: that is a shit of m+ just saying
[5:44:17] viopoppinoff: Do some classes need a group to do Torghast or can every class do it all solo?
[5:44:23] chabas_: hey @Towelliee whats the world boss of the week?
[5:44:27] LoremasterMarthan: I mean if i thought about casual right now, i would think of people still actively doing M0 tbh
[5:44:48] TarMonA: the purple world quest
[5:45:11] Rictamar: truly casual ppl don't raid, do maybe 1 or 2 m+ a week and their dailies sometimes lol
[5:45:28] hooliggan: The goo boss is a pain almost killed me a couple times
[5:45:37] irlock143: @Towelliee they nerf wrath :(
[5:45:42] TarMonA: every class can solo but easier in a group. 2s or full dungeon group
[5:45:43] RunningOutOfRAM: Tow let me explain how the chest opening works
[5:45:48] irlock143: frommo 100% to 60%

[5:50:28] casualboomer: @Towelliee can confirm no subsequent quest from Bolvar.

[5:50:33] casualboomer: Expect we're 2 weeks out from Twisting
[5:50:36] Clawanorder: Which WA?
[5:50:38] armybone1: why healer... ranged dps can do the maze puzzle
[5:51:09] Boab: Has the large cooldowns being reset thing been implemented into torghast yet?

[6:00:42] its_andyd: if youre gonna have that take, please be mindful that your opinion of live influences the community
[6:00:43] garlicco: the bad place
[6:00:49] grizz412: Where's ol Garry at? I just wanna see ma boy.
[6:00:58] Aidler: layer 8 swiftOmg . I can hardly do layer 4
[6:01:06] Vile_: @grizz412 Garrosh is in Revendreth lol
[6:01:54] grizz412: @Vile_ Yeah, i know. I just wanna know where and when we'll see him haha
[6:01:56] Zettabyte: the no jumping one is OP AF Kappa
[6:02:15] KnsWoW: 4 stack corrosive dmg.. lets get it
[6:02:18] its_andyd: its trash
[6:02:22] jason_tacey: seems Limit is pvp'ing
[6:02:22] cashuys: Lol I don’t understand echo, like why not stream
[6:02:31] FruckAwesome: got a 213 wep outta vault woot
[6:02:48] quasar08: So what’s max soul ash this week now?
[6:02:56] Aidler: @cashuys nobody does
[6:02:57] heavenscloud1517: my vault was all cloak and rings lol
[6:03:04] jerexify: @Towelliee Guy to the platform to your left has a power.
[6:03:09] Kneckt: i just got a power that increased my hp by 45% LOL WHAT
[6:03:51] datcreepa: what was the best attempt so far?
[6:04:19] cashuys: Apparently method site is reporting that echo is ahead? What?
[6:04:21] Collected1: they're resuming streaming tomorrow so we'll see
[6:04:22] Mecabeast: I did a layer 8 yesterday and had 2 floors with no mobs and all traps had barely 200 phantasma by floor 3 and had the destroyer boss thats been receiving a bunch of complaints
[6:04:33] danidude_o7: Hey chat, I am considering starting up wow again, and starting as a shaman. But I heard they are getting nerfed hard, is this true?
[6:04:33] jure__: They got out of phase 1 in like 5 attempts
[6:04:42] gfield2k: So why they not streaming it, but watching someone else
[6:05:14] Collected1: I understood they're streaming the last boss. they were just concerned about the reset gap between US/EU
[6:05:17] KyruNL: LUL
[6:05:23] cashuys: It’s fine limit will kill it today hahah
[6:05:24] jason_tacey: LUL
[6:05:25] bookooti: They not streaming because they are bad and only copy other guilds strategy's KEKW
[6:05:25] Daggerstry: There was a claim they made it to the secret phase, but no proof
[6:05:27] jennagraces: LUL
[6:05:27] Pey0: they'll probably stream denathrius when they get back they just didn't want to give limit info after they reclear
[6:05:27] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee's got jokes.
[6:05:30] jaina8675309: PogChamp
[6:05:43] Horseweave: @danidude88 Negative. Restoration got a slight nerfed, but still very strong.
[6:05:50] pooranoia: that was kinda jokes
[6:05:50] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[6:06:30] danidude_o7: @Horseweave Thanks mate. Going to be restro but dont mind a nerf, as long it is not into oblivion :P
[6:06:31] Kneckt: secret phase looks insane
[6:06:38] Kneckt: massacre amd ravage at same time
[6:06:54] fourseti1234: @Towelliee do you have money on the race?
[6:07:04] Drakenking: Yeah I mean limit made it to secret phase last night multiple times
[6:07:05] TheCliffyShow: But no one's gotten to the super secret phase where Garrosh appears and starts doing TikTok dances.
[6:07:07] Drakenking: on stream
[6:07:08] pooranoia: to be fair, if they win its going to pay off big for them
[6:07:24] Drakenking: @smashirl How if theyre not streaming it KEKW
[6:07:26] pooranoia: I respect it winning is more important then 70k views atm
[6:07:26] danidude_o7: @Horseweave Know whats good at lvling as shaman? also is it worth starting from 1? :)
[6:07:34] Drakenking: No its not
[6:07:36] Reklusion: If Echo looses, theres going to be so many KEKW 's going their way
[6:07:49] Collected1: Roger's argument is Echo didn't want to give Limit any knowledge they could then use in the 24 hour gap between resets. Obviously the argument there is Limit don't need any help. But whatever that was their justification and why they intend to stream again tomorrow.
[6:07:49] metavahn231: when does stone legion generals unlock on LFR?
[6:07:52] Drakenking: Not even remotely close, and if you think theyre going to get any respect for NOT streaming while being able to take limits strats, what a joke
[6:07:53] pooranoia: because they will get more viewers next race
[6:07:59] pathagris: Dumb question seeing as how I’m at work lol is soulforges open today?
[6:08:10] FatTown: they die and come back
[6:08:13] FatTown: its what their buff says
[6:08:33] Drakenking: @smashirl unfortunately that doesnt un-piss off your sponsors and it doesnt put money in your hand now to pay your players
[6:08:37] mmrghost7: nope
[6:08:39] Drakenking: and again, is just a completely bitch ass move
[6:08:42] Collected1: Echo aren't winning. They don't have Max.
[6:08:44] pooranoia: if they prove them selves now, next race 70k views will seem small, they will have double
[6:09:05] pooranoia: @Drakenking true
[6:09:10] Drakenking: They already lost my respect for turning the stream off for a day
[6:09:48] metavahn231: should of never streamed world first, its a competition not a show
[6:09:49] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years.

[6:10:04] metavahn231: why let the enemy see your strats
[6:10:10] pooranoia: I still think they made the correct move
[6:10:22] Horseweave: @danidude88 Depends on you. You want Race Heirloom, start at one. Best Class to play? All on your style
[6:10:28] TheCliffyShow: Looks like Limit is about to go back in. Unless this is a replay.
[6:10:28] Aidler: let's hope they don't win. would set a terrible precedence for not streaming
[6:10:28] Drakenking: @Veramer because they were on an even playing field and it benefits both guilds, who couldnt do what they do without the income from their sponsors and organizations
[6:10:38] Dcarter: it is a show
[6:10:39] Dcarter: wtf
[6:10:53] JeemTeam: lol
[6:10:55] liviu_81: hope not a shit show Kappa
[6:10:57] Drakenking: They can just go back to doing the world first race in their basement and cheer to themselves when they win or they can make a boatload of money and build a content platform
[6:11:02] FranciscoTheMage: its a bunch of made up stuff. a spectacle.
[6:11:06] PotbellyGoat: I think it's silly for them not to get the views and build their brand
[6:11:07] TheCliffyShow: Limit is standing outside of the raid right now.
[6:11:11] pooranoia: its a new guild they want to secure 1st, then they will stream everything
[6:11:13] pooranoia: watch
[6:11:19] Collected1: they'll see it from tomorrow don't worry.
[6:11:28] Drakenking: theyre not a new guild lmao its literally method minus sco
[6:11:28] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[6:11:31] spacemarine55: So are twisting corridors the endless version of torgast open this week or no ?
[6:11:38] KonradGM: generally from what i konw abouyt my non wow playing friends, most people dont watch wow streams for the game since they find it boring, they watch for entertainment around it
[6:11:38] RodneyIsPro: BACK IN MY DAY!....
[6:11:39] JeemTeam: ppl so entitled, the internet, lulw
[6:11:44] pooranoia: @Drakenking its a new name
[6:11:54] binr_: and why they don't wanna stream? I missed it sry
[6:11:56] pooranoia: @Drakenking same shit
[6:12:08] FranciscoTheMage: that the old days when people played the game for the challenge not for fucking clicks
[6:12:11] Pey0: idk if i'd call it entitled they advertised a race to world first stream with coverage then turned off their streams
[6:12:14] Drakenking: keep making excuses for them if you want man, its shit integrity, it's bad for the environment of the game, and it makes them look like bitches to viewers AND their sponsors
[6:12:18] Pey0: not surprised they're getting shit for it lol
[6:12:19] Collected1: binr_ : they were worried about the 24 hours between US/EU reset and giving Limit any advantage
[6:12:29] TheCliffyShow: I got the Complexity channel on my other screen to see how the reclear starts.
[6:12:30] pooranoia: just because its same people they need to prove under a new banner
[6:12:53] viopoppinoff: Pog
[6:13:05] fourseti1234: Towelliee believes he can fly!
[6:13:16] Drakenking: Echo is literally pulling a slasher lmao
[6:13:30] Drakenking: 'Yeah guys were doing really well in the raid.. cant show you it or anything but just know, were doing better then limit'
[6:13:32] pooranoia: people will give shit all day but once they win all those people flip.. thats life
[6:13:36] TheCliffyShow: The Limit commentators must be bored. They talking about jeans.
[6:13:44] binr_: ah ok thx @collected1
[6:13:47] Drakenking: Nah, even if they won fuck echo for bitching out

[6:13:59] Zettabyte: Shade doing WF next time Kapppa
[6:14:02] Zettabyte: Kappa *
[6:14:11] jason_tacey: limit's pvp'ing last I seen
[6:14:24] its_andyd: echo is a guild of cheaters and no life losers
[6:14:33] jure__: people are so emotional about a bunch of people not streaming, lmao LUL
[6:14:33] SorionTheGinger: isn't that kind of bad sportsmanship? @Towelliee
[6:14:35] raymond3195: method doing well
[6:14:36] Colt_Engineer: what about method? KEKW
[6:14:38] captain_e: what addon displays interupts? dbm?
[6:14:44] TheCliffyShow: @jason_tacey They about to start the raid again now.
[6:14:46] Aidler: sounds unfair if you say it like that
[6:14:48] Drakenking: Probably better that way, dont want inferior EU strategies clogging up the brain
[6:14:54] Drakenking: Might just make your strats worse
[6:14:56] Stoneownz: does the mythic lockout auto reset?
[6:15:13] its_andyd: doesnt sou nd like a guild i want to support
[6:15:14] fourseti1234: at the end of the day the gamer who wins gets the girl
[6:15:20] jason_tacey: @TheCliffyShow yeah I looked about 20 minutes ago so I guess they moved on by then
[6:15:36] casualboomer: Method didn't care about a pedophile. Why would they care about sportsmanship?
[6:15:41] ExpoUhl: Obviously
[6:15:47] Collected1: we'll see the WF kill live that's all I care about really
[6:15:49] Teejay1: lol love that movie
[6:15:54] JeemTeam: its not bad sportsmanship
[6:15:59] Aidler: sponsors like good sportsmanship. it's good for business
[6:16:00] Bayne77: Rubbin is Racin
[6:16:01] JeemTeam: its called winneing
[6:16:01] SorionTheGinger: @Towelliee yeah you're probably right - but still feels kinda cheap, they all started into the race under the banner "we streamin it" and then someones opting out - ofc limit could do the same, but still
[6:16:07] raymond3195: they will when sponsor walk away
[6:16:13] JeemTeam: lol

[6:16:25] PotbellyGoat: if you're not first you're last
[6:16:30] Drakenking: Thats literally the story of Limit
[6:16:35] Arcazua: buy the 5 phantasma anima power
[6:16:41] Drakenking: Limit was never founded to be a world first guild
[6:16:44] Bedpan_BoB: @Potbelly_Jenkins exactly
[6:16:44] Twigz_KC: Tony Danza.. he's the boss
[6:17:30] Coreyzano: Echo always bounces back... Kappa
[6:17:46] Collected1: the big numbers start tomorrow
[6:17:46] Incredible_Sausage: just numbers on a page at the end of the day for sponsors
[6:17:47] LoudDerp: I love torghast as prot pally.
[6:17:48] Murtorog: Murtorog subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[6:17:50] Collected1: everything else was a preview
[6:17:54] binr_: the small sponsors maybe but they doing something wrong
[6:17:58] FranciscoTheMage: sounds horrible linking your livelihood to the whims of some sponsor @Towelliee
[6:18:03] heavenscloud1517: they are a business and its a mutual relationship, one side doesn't keep up then they leave
[6:18:07] Tyr7: and Sco got a ton of new gen players and will rebuild again
[6:18:14] Dcarter: the roster is for sure better than methods
[6:18:16] TheCliffyShow: Limit is now fighting Shriekwing.
[6:18:33] pooranoia: they could have asked their spencer before even turning the stream off we dont know
[6:18:39] TheCliffyShow: And the commentators are talking about Strawberry Puppy Kisses.
[6:18:46] Drakenking: Both of echos tanks are better then sco
[6:18:49] Ezekyler: chains of the dead monkaS
[6:18:58] ebone45: just a restructure
[6:19:05] its_andyd: how do you know this much towelliee
[6:19:12] Ezekyler: how many people died climbing these chains? PepeHands
[6:19:16] Alienfromger: still acting "shady" without stream
[6:19:22] Artivicii: how do i torghast as healer 4Head
[6:20:05] Ezekyler: @Artivicii like Arenas, bore your enemies until they die Kappa
[6:20:06] Zettabyte: you heal them to death @Artivicii Kappa
[6:20:08] Drakenking: I would actually prefer to just never hear the method name again, the level of control method had over WoWs pro scene was really unhealthy
[6:20:12] Daggerstry: Nah. They shadey
[6:20:16] Aidler: this time around I like what new Method is doing and I don't like at all what Echo is doing
[6:20:22] towellieeesboy: towelliee is paid by limit...lol
[6:20:26] HaxzorJimDuggan: @Artivicii Don't die Kappa
[6:20:26] Reklusion: Not Echo's streams KEKW Maybe ingame LUL
[6:20:44] fourseti1234: or PUG KAppa
[6:20:52] trivwik: That is like saying that every player that does not stream when they play is doing something shady.
[6:21:00] jasperboy: Before, when no one streamed, blizz had ppl watching them almost 24/7
[6:21:00] its_andyd: how can they watch echo when they arent even streaming...
[6:21:11] Collected1: GMs are usually stood in the raid instance
[6:21:46] jasperboy: I bet Zorbrix is flying around in the room watching echo getting smacked my Sire LUL
[6:21:49] Collected1: must be a fun job to get that perspective
[6:21:57] LSBreed: Whelp nightfae renown quest completely bugged for me yay....
[6:22:02] JukasZor: thats the worst thing about torghast.. it's such rng based upon which powers you draw
[6:22:20] Artivicii: lvl 1LUL

[6:22:55] Collected1: lets hope we dont get another NZoth scenario where they're hot fixing the encounter during pulls
[6:23:29] its_andyd: limit fixes bugs and echo still has to stop streaming OMEGALUL
[6:23:30] Aidler: not saying they are doing something shady but what is a streamer that doesn't stream... nothing. what is a show or race you can't watch.... nothing
[6:23:45] Collected1: Aidler : they're resuming tomorrow so it will all work itself out.
[6:23:55] Anubizath: Does the soulkeeper upgrade only work for next week?
[6:23:56] Collected1: they just decided to go dark for 24 hours before the reset
[6:24:38] toobaked1987: @Towelliee Tell your boys to GIVE US A FLIGHT WHISTLE
[6:24:40] danidude_o7: Any class you should avoid atm in WoW Shadowlands?
[6:24:53] Fangy_Playz: Like who gives a shit that they went dark. If they want to hide strats or pulls let them. There is tons of other streams to watch in this race.

[6:25:04] Coreyzano: When I move you move, just like that
[6:25:26] trivwik: Everyone that complains about Echo not streaming, needs to stream every time they open the game. Blizz sees everything. They are God in Azeroth and can easily track every movement that is done.
[6:25:42] Fangy_Playz: Method isn't doing bad for having to rebuild.
[6:25:50] garroshdidnuthinwrong: Did limit stream the first day of progression ? I bet yes, so echo gladly took the advantage of watching but when it comes to giving back ... not a good player imo ... I know its a race and all but still you took, you gotta give ...
[6:25:53] itsTwigs_: Good mornin @Towelliee
[6:26:00] Collected1: i think they should let 10 guilds get to the last boss and then unlock it at the exact same time for all 10. now that would be a show.
[6:26:09] r0b928: !watchtime
[6:26:28] MavreckBap: is he using a different addon for the healthbars?
[6:26:33] Fangy_Playz: @garroshdidnuthinwrong LUL what they don't, It's the guilds choice. They don't HAVE to give anything they choose to.
[6:26:44] jure__: @garroshdidnuthinwrong jesus... FailFish dont go full retard
[6:27:17] maple_butters: @Towelliee what layer you doing ?

[6:28:52] Forkyx: Which conduits or w/e did u get in m+?

[9:11:22] BrutalBlueberry: The US Credit System is fucked.
[9:11:26] MrGattz: cause murica
[9:11:29] Bellious99: @Grobaldin np :D
[9:11:30] MOLAR305: its a thing because you dont have payments on time
[9:11:31] Ballswagger: just dont finance 4Head
[9:11:36] mayhemguy: becos the account closes, they dont like tat
[9:11:53] Artivicii: LUL
[9:11:58] Noshpan: It's to keep people in debt
[9:12:03] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[9:12:03] mayhemguy: yeah it does not make sense
[9:12:05] Zulbrak121: so stupid. I paid every month about a week before the payment date, and yeah my credit went down 20 points after i paid it off. seems really backwards which makes no sense.
[9:12:06] raldrik: the cred system is designed to keep you in dept
[9:12:09] Malarick: but did you take another loan for a car(
[9:12:09] Ballswagger: just buy more cars
[9:12:11] captiv8: what car did you buy?
[9:12:11] sklingel: its the American way
[9:12:15] MOLAR305: well you need 6 months of ontime payments to get the score to what it was
[9:12:16] TarMonA: no the will hurt the score too
[9:12:18] BrutalBlueberry: Number of credit accounts open affects it decently.
[9:12:19] Artivicii: just buy a ferrari 4Head
[9:12:19] PotbellyGoat: I tell my wife this all the time- keep 3 lines of credit open
[9:12:21] Twinning12: The score only drops for like a month or so then goes abck up or it did for mine
[9:12:24] Malarick: yes you are 100% right
[9:12:27] remedyt: need new debt yeah its a garbage system
[9:12:27] BoezIRL: sounds like capitalism
[9:12:29] MOLAR305: bc the minute they pull your credit for the new car, it goes down again
[9:12:29] relaylloll: what car did u guy
[9:12:30] bc_23_: it will go back up within 30 days
[9:12:47] suppstantial: irshwow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[9:12:50] Mecabeast: so dumb personally it should go up x amount based on paying within y time
[9:12:52] DanceAtTheMoonlight: @Towelliee in germany we have the Shufa ... and its even worse ... they basically decide what you can have in life and what not xD
[9:13:02] Artivicii: so if i buy 5 cars, ill get approved for the mansion?? 4Head
[9:13:03] remedyt: just dont ever pay it off :)
[9:13:08] relaylloll: what car did u buy ??
[9:13:14] suppstantial: it's probably actually better for your credit to lease - constantly have a payment
[9:13:23] bc_23_: when your debt to income ratio hits your report it will add close to 60 points
[9:13:29] Malarick: exactly better to lease.
[9:13:51] big808: best app easily
[9:14:04] suppstantial: I've always thought it was better to own, but now that I'm looking for a new car and trying to move definitely looking to lease
