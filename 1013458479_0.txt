[0:13:36] dwolters_the_zombieman: you become a punching bag for the boss
[0:14:30] Vexxsis: lol p2w
[0:14:54] Convectus: lol
[0:15:11] Broomba: WTF? P2W!!!!
[0:15:21] HaxzorJimDuggan: well you get mounts at 30 now so thats incorrect

[0:36:49] Alexkayzz: Guess they didn't expect stuff like the 35$ price for the boost and stuff
[0:36:52] oldmangamer0: LMAO!!!!!!!
[0:36:53] adrian_fell: didnt know the pricing tho
[0:36:53] ChalupaBatman25: it's not like every expac has had deluxe editions since forever
[0:36:58] warbabam: p2w
[0:37:00] Hellifyoudont66: There's a very short pre-patch window, 25 dollars per toon copy is absurd...
[0:37:03] fistofnature: but you cant expect everyone to pay attention or follow all the news wowhead puts out
[0:37:03] verentnarv: how much will the de cost?

[0:37:22] mymomsprimeaccount: Didn’t original BC have a collector’s editions?
[0:37:29] adrian_fell: ye i mean the clone 35 dollar charge is the one that has me asking "why"
[0:37:41] myamoray: people would get mad if there was nothing to be mad about! You can't please all of the people all of the time
[0:37:41] oldmangamer0: Yea I thought it was going to be 60 too
[0:37:45] TheCliffyShow: I don't care about TBC Classic but I want the warp stalker mount.
[0:37:46] NILLme: 70 for the mounts and toy.. idk
[0:37:55] Aidler: asmon doesn't like the deluxe edition so many don't like it naguuraWut
[0:38:03] Davediggity25: the class boost is only going to lead to an inflation warlocks...
[0:38:09] Davediggity25: of
[0:38:16] 91Niki: @Aidler Sheep will be sheep 🤷
[0:38:33] jkitchin75: asmon chat needs to get laid
[0:38:39] Aidler: @91Niki true
[0:38:52] 91Niki: @jkitchin75 if ONLY that fixed the issue LUL

[0:39:24] Wcvechten: I mean, you don't have to buy it either
[0:39:41] NILLme: @magemaster225 probably for all? would be weird if its for 1
[0:39:42] jkitchin75: @91Niki or just shoot them
[0:39:43] dinomiyte: wait how do u get the warpstalker mount?

[0:41:11] ShieldslamTV: Yo that's pretty lit
[0:41:19] Apokolipz: gachiHYPER
[0:41:28] ClassicMalcontent: So. TBC Classic one 'free' (wink-wink) clone per character. Clone to both $35. Boost is $39.99. TBC Deluxe is $69.99 includes boost, mount, 30 days game time and some cosmetics. I am amazed they are including a BOOST with the deluxe edition.
[0:41:31] KaisenSiru: PogChamp
[0:41:48] NILLme: bet its a similar fight to Naxx classic :D atleast same theme
[0:41:59] MistaHat: @ClassicMalcontent what is the 'Free' part youre talking about
[0:42:27] ClassicMalcontent: @MistaHat the "free" (quoted) as in you pay the sub to choose which "clone" to activate (TBC or Classic)
[0:42:28] Aidler: @jamarky23 asmons complain sessions are the best reminder for me that I can buy a new mount - lol
[0:42:29] HaxzorJimDuggan: @MistaHat you choose to stay in Classic or go to TBC that choice is free
[0:42:38] HaxzorJimDuggan: if you want both you pay
[0:43:06] MessengerDown1: hey towlliee hows it going
[0:43:07] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's latest Youtube video! https://youtu.be/U8-64zqVa8k Shadowlands needs some help
[0:43:37] Alexkayzz: @Towelliee  is the guy talking your retail guild's raid leader?
[0:43:54] dinomiyte: is the warpstalker mount just for tbc?
[0:44:13] MistaHat: @ClassicMalcontent oh ok, im not sure your point unless youre complaining about the price. or even the freakin need to clone. but i getcha now
[0:44:16] ClassicMalcontent: @dinomiyte mount for retail and tbc with slightly different names
[0:44:50] ClassicMalcontent: @MistaHat no. I'm just pointing out it's free as in pay the sub is all. But more surprised they include a boost with the deluxe edition.
[0:44:55] dinomiyte: ok coo, thank you for answering @ClassicMalcontent
[0:45:03] magemaster225: dude is melting
[0:45:28] NILLme: prob phase 1
[0:45:33] Korupcija_: easy kill
[0:45:52] zSKIz1: !uptime
[0:45:52] Moobot: @GryzSki Towelliee has been live for 46m 4s
[0:46:05] ClassicMalcontent: I think including the boost with the TBC deluxe actually surprised me and I'm not often surprised. I actually fully expected they would charge $70 for just mount/cosmetics and still separately offer a boost without bundling.
[0:46:27] Kinghorn: I was also surprised the boost was so cheap
[0:46:33] George2001k: @towelliee how’s the fight looking?
[0:46:37] NILLme: classic mobs :D
[0:46:39] Kinghorn: the cloning is hilariously expensive though
[0:47:02] Tigerklaue: yes 35 is a joke everyone should get one cloning for free
[0:47:04] ClassicMalcontent: @Kinghorn yeah the Boost cost less than I expected (as standalone) but the Clone costs more. I thought for sure clone would be WoW Token / $20 price point.
[0:47:35] swordart_19: This room looks Pog
[0:47:54] ChalupaBatman25: what do yall mean cloning? like taking a classic server toon to a tbc classic server?
[0:47:57] ClassicMalcontent: @Tigerklaue I agree. And then other clone to both should be $20 after one free clone-to-both.
[0:48:25] swordart_19: aa that many legs lady
[0:48:32] ClassicMalcontent: @ChalupaBatman25 you choose where you 'activate your character' TBC classic or WoW classic and to do both you pay.
[0:48:33] swordart_19: i see
[0:49:00] Buckwink: exactly
[0:49:01] ClassicMalcontent: That's true.

[0:49:03] MackAttack1421: How will that work with Gold?
[0:49:10] MackAttack1421: For cloning?
[0:49:12] KaisenSiru: Yeah, I get first boss Eternal Palace reminder with this room shape.size
[0:49:16] Kinghorn: 35 is towCringe
[0:49:27] ClassicMalcontent: Yeah. Clone to both (Classic and TBC) is $35 per character.
[0:49:36] Buckwink: it's an obvious response to the massive drop in subs
[0:49:38] Kinghorn: oh yeah it does look like EP first boss room
[0:49:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: @MackAttack1421 you have whatever that character had at the time of the snapshot/prepatch
[0:49:41] ClassicMalcontent: I expected $20 or less and maybe first one free. No dice.
[0:49:42] Kinghorn: good call
[0:49:46] Unciatim: Frost Mages should get a Kelthuzad skin drop from him
[0:49:54] Kinghorn: actually almost cookiecutter
[0:49:58] Blistz1: How much does it cost to run the servers tho. i expected to be $10- $15 so it can cover the servers
[0:50:00] MackAttack1421: So, I should stack all my gold on my cloning character
[0:50:02] DudeInARobe: $70 for TBC deluxe is a bit much too imo. We already pay for it monthly. And nothing THAT good comes out of it
[0:50:09] fowlentv: they should add a clone to the $70 collectors edition imo
[0:50:16] ClassicMalcontent: @MackAttack1421 no. Your gold is the same on both.
[0:50:19] Kinghorn: the mount is 100% mount speed
[0:50:27] Kinghorn: so all of your characters get free 100 speed
[0:50:30] Kinghorn: forever
[0:50:30] swordart_19: @DudeInARobe 70 is good deal if you can count what i contains 1 by 1 you like dont have to buy it .
[0:50:41] Kinghorn: that is kinda worth

[0:50:52] Apokolipz: blizzard is price gouging in a pandemic
[0:51:02] ClassicMalcontent: @MackAttack1421 you won't get to choose when to clone you will be forced to choose on or after 5/18 and both 'clones' will have the same amount if you clone.
[0:51:06] Unciatim: holy.. is this normal? They are ripping threw his HP
[0:51:15] swordart_19: these who can and want will buy it and these who do not want will not.
[0:51:17] Tigerklaue: you need to kill him multiple times
[0:51:18] Worgenrunt01: he respawns throughout the fight
[0:51:20] Kinghorn: it is phase 1
[0:51:25] swordart_19: @Unciatim herroic
[0:51:28] ClassicMalcontent: @MackAttack1421 if you chose to activate later, it will be the amount you had when the realms split.
[0:51:33] Unciatim: @Worgenrunt01 ah ok
[0:51:51] swordart_19: You can say his HP works like Ilgynoth goes down fast but has like multiple lives nad stuff
[0:51:57] 91Niki: LUL
[0:52:02] Tigerklaue: dont need a tank down there, he just casts
