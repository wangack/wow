[2:18:34] thenirv10: it's the exact same as 15 years ago lol
[2:18:36] xViewersunitedx: classic feral druids were cool but farming gnomer all the time sucks

[2:21:36] Gizadragon: is there still room in the guild
[2:21:37] xViewersunitedx: theres so much shit in tbc you wil be busy for 2 months
[2:21:50] rosina_scarlett: pre nerf muru will be fun as fuck
[2:21:53] IreScath: laugh if you want... i'll post teh vods when it happens ;)
[2:21:59] xwalonosx: People don’t realize that classic was released on 1.12 so the gearing and bosses were all tuned differently than vanilla launch. This allowed for people to roll in and absolutely stomp raids right off the bat. Different game. Glad for the changes
[2:22:04] Grawh1: actualy I do..IU main tanked in TNC and I know it is gonna be easy mode
[2:22:07] kashiark: i wish they would go beyond pre nerf and buff the bosses maybe even add mechanics
[2:22:08] Triton82: hey towel! towHorde
[2:22:14] killawatts75: @contentstarvedgamer guilds won’t clear gruuls lair day one if it’s pre nerf it’s actually impossible numbers wise
[2:22:18] sadbods: they arent going to do pre nef hyjal trash that respawns behind you surely

[2:22:47] TheDabbai: blizz is too focused on remasters LUL
[2:22:49] sadbods: hokay
[2:22:50] Grawh1: The hardest part of TBC is gonna be farming all those mounts
[2:23:08] Gizadragon: ok ty

[2:24:47] chrslp: I loved Sunwell
[2:25:17] spacemarine55: Hardest thing about BT was getting the bosses to work right mother shazz bugged and one shot tanks for months lol
[2:25:27] rosina_scarlett: alot of guild couldn't kill muru till his hp was nerfed
[2:25:31] chrslp: BT was soooooo time consuming
[2:25:36] xwalonosx: @masumii3 1-2 lockouts ?
[2:25:38] autotune_wow: @contentstarvedgamer lol wut
[2:25:41] balanira: i member my guild was super trash in tbc ... we were hard stuck on reliquary of souls
[2:25:43] NewWorldReign: @Towelliee Did you expect Blizzard to use Illidan again in Legion?
[2:25:44] rosina_scarlett: @xwalonosx maybe
[2:25:50] spacemarine55: Gonna be nice to do BT TK and sunwell with the bosses actually working right
[2:25:50] xViewersunitedx: didnt you guys hear wrath cancelled due to lack of interest blizz is going right to cata after tbc danK
[2:25:58] Triton82: thanks brother for answering @towelliee
[2:26:15] xwalonosx: @masumii3 some guild will throw 400+ wipes at it in 2 lockouts is my guess

[2:32:43] jesseh91: honestly though i'm kind of shocked it took this long for EA to cancel it
[2:32:52] GiraffeHydra_: Man, I was actually excited for that

[2:35:42] shmurcules: Are they adding personal loot to tbc?
[2:35:42] xViewersunitedx: one mans lie started off badly
[2:35:56] Noshpan: EA's good at making games suffer. *cough* Warhammer Online *cough*
[2:35:59] xViewersunitedx: and got much better after awhile
[2:36:02] PadidinJones: but SWTOR pretty much reached endgame.
[2:36:09] Tempt_nL: No @shmurcules
[2:36:15] jesseh91: i mean it sucks, the changes you said sounded cool, and its kind of frustrating that EA feels the need to do shit like this cause they're a PoS company tbh
[2:36:15] Tuppe: Warhammer Online was a great game. RIP
[2:36:24] NewWorldReign: speaking of MMO, #RIPAnthem

[2:36:35] nymbus_3: SWTOR has a lot of potential imo
[2:36:38] shmurcules: I heard they are changing things this time .. maybe personal loot was one of them
[2:36:48] svenskavelli: playing SWTOR atm and its still going strong, 10 year anniverary coming up and devs hint at something massive
[2:37:02] PadidinJones: Did you do the last Emperor storyline @Towelliee ?
