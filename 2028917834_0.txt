[0:46:31] pokirane: wireless g600 when logitech
[0:46:55] Vyndrodis: my hot tip for the scimitar is manually set all of the DPI profiles to the default speed you use so you dont accidentally hit the profile change button and now your cursor is fucked
[0:46:57] cucumbertoessniffa: i got a new scimitar and a nice little 60% keyboard from corsair too. new year new me YEP
