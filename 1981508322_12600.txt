[7:36:08] Nightbot: Okay so apparently this 'Ouker' guy already has 42069 hours clocked in to this game as it came out. I just dont understand how he thinks its fair to smurf versus his OWN friends? He totally humiliated singsing with that godlike gameplay, how singsing just took that silently I cant understand. He needs to queue ranked to match with similar omega skilled players, not this band of Pepega 's . See you on r/garfieldkart Ouker.

[13:05:37] Asklepios_NL: I jjust don't remember why exactly I hated Cata KEK was it the healer changes?
[13:05:40] Reticent_88: @Asklepios_NL Cata just changed talents where you got 1 point every 2 levels instead of every level. Still had proper trees. MoP destroyed it all
[13:05:42] DuKeIt0uT: @DrSpookenstein, just hate transmog all together
[13:06:03] DrSpookenstein: @DuKeIt0uT transmog is the most BASED thing they added to the game
[13:06:04] Hjolt: i disliked that cata had inflated numbers. we were nearing millions in dps
[13:06:13] Asklepios_NL: I member they changed something about healing and I full on hated it JerryKEK
[13:06:14] Reticent_88: @Asklepios_NL Healers actually took a small amount of skill in Cata, unlike earlier expansions, so there's that

[13:07:22] Hjolt: i didnt like talent changes in MoP but i unironically enjoyed the questing there. f-fuck em pandas maybe but it had cool coherent theme
[13:07:24] Reticent_88: @Asklepios_NL It wasn't as spammable as in Wrath etc. Mana was an actual issue again
[13:07:48] rnllie: what level is sing now?
[13:07:52] Hitrasq: Only 360p?
[13:07:58] Asklepios_NL: @Reticent_88 Yeah I think I hated that part... I needed to pay attention to the game again instead of just braindead time wasting
[13:07:58] Reticent_88: @Asklepios_NL Yeah I played Resto Druid in retail Wrath too. Lifeblooms on main tank, Wild Growth on cooldown, blanket the entire raid with Rejuv KEK
