[3:55:30] TheBunBun: Is it truly so unbelievable?
[3:55:32] Sneakzx: o yeah
[3:55:34] devvastate: The Sphinx is way older than modern Egyptologists claim imho. I think the great pyramid was already there during the time of the Egyptians.

[3:56:03] Sneakzx: go listen to some of billy carsons takes. he knows alot about what youre talking about
[3:56:05] xbento: yea @SONII read up about zunniyaki
[3:56:08] ImGravycakes: ye peeps think it didnt originaly have a human head and was built on it later
[3:56:10] Based________: do u think sam sulek is chad? @SONII
[3:56:13] Towenaar2: sphinx is a hologram
[3:56:15] devvastate: Like they had inherited the pyramid. And water erosion on the Sphinx.
[3:56:21] Youtube_Historian: Cleopatria is closer in history to the cellpohne than she is to the building of the great pyramids

[3:57:10] TheBunBun: Did cleo state "no man will ever find my body?" such a baddie
[3:57:13] kevinxdelgado: let me take a quick dab before we unpack this topic
[3:57:20] FIREMAGZZ: GIGA LAKE CHAD
[3:57:24] TheBunBun: didnt*
[3:57:25] ellipt1k: If want some interesting information, start looking at how many ancient Greek philosophers went to study in Egypt. The Hermetica gets real cool
[3:57:31] Wooshu: The Summerians were before the Egyptians
[3:57:46] kindNifti: meteor?
[3:57:48] jirkasaurus: most likely
[3:57:50] Bee_On_Co: Bro, if you believe in that stuff. Look up the "Owl of washington DC"
[3:57:59] devvastate: So like zoom out even more on google maps. It looks like there was a giant flood on the entire top of africa.
[3:58:01] Megarachnid: and it's already highly speculated that there were huge floods in this area
[3:58:02] locris4: Egypt is so old that the pharoahs who built the pyramids where doing archaeology on even older egyptian civilisations
[3:58:06] vepsee: just an ancient civizilation
[3:58:06] Screamnsteam: catJAM

[3:58:51] terlet_terwilliger: basically hyper advanced ancient civilization that everyone heard about but didn't know where it was
[3:59:03] alokni_: The girl from the movie Atlantis was a baddie. The animation/drawing team knew what they were doing
[3:59:22] devvastate: @SONII You should look up Göbekli Tepe. Literally should not exist according to our knowledge of humans.
[3:59:22] scmilee: but 10k years before rome

[3:59:43] Shepp22: is it even a real place?
[3:59:44] 15Judychops: plato was a time traveller just like indiana jones
[3:59:50] thewayitg0es: im front atlantis :)
[3:59:50] Tygram8: so wherever it was its under alot of water
[3:59:51] Wooshu: plato only described it. he never went there
[3:59:56] TheBunBun: we lost a ton of info with the burning of alexandria library
[4:00:05] Wooshu: single chat man

[4:00:07] Bee_On_Co: Plato went to a closet.

[4:01:25] r0nin_xd: SPARK NOTES
[4:01:25] DaMousse: Learning about the the same things in american history for 4 years ResidentSleeper
[4:01:29] vepsee: "Plato's vague indications of the time of the events (more than 9,000 years before his time[8]) and the alleged location of Atlantis ("beyond the Pillars of Hercules") gave rise to much pseudoscientific speculation.[9] As a consequence, Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction, from comic books to films." from wiki
[4:01:34] Iol69: @earthbound_martian are you talking about the history chat is talking about? lol
[4:01:35] KaizenKam: baba yaga
[4:01:52] earthbound_martian: @Iol69 yes of course

[4:02:03] scmilee: fucking nerd
[4:02:04] earthbound_martian: @Iol69 "history"
[4:02:20] Wooshu: You know whats crazy, if civilization was to restart again, there would be no record of us. Our buildings wouldnt stand like those made of stone. Ancients were smart and wrote their history on tablets.. our are in books and the internet
[4:02:26] collinsss: do you get your water directly delivered from the mountain spring website? I love that water
[4:02:30] GTokie: well the pyramids are real, where is atlantis?
[4:02:32] Iol69: the hulk is a time traveler and he built the pyramids

[4:02:35] kevinxdelgado: would you fuck a mermaid?
[4:02:36] MaximumSerg: you drunk? lol
[4:02:39] Ashbringer57: plato's description of Atlantis has a similarities to the richad structure in the sahara
[4:02:41] outofmanax: 2 much jre
[4:02:42] vepsee: Some theories is they used some water vibration tech from atlantis as a massive advanced naval civ to make the pyramids possibly, just one theory
[4:02:42] rededged: anything is possible with unlimited slaves
[4:02:50] afraidanuffin: The pyramids are literally built next to the quarries, dude
[4:02:54] locris4: wtf
[4:02:54] Kaz1s: what is the server name?
[4:02:54] Wooshu: yep

[4:03:14] vepsee: ok now the serious questions, were wizards and dragons real
[4:03:21] Ghostmoves_: if you want to get lost in the rabbit hole, look up the Younger  Dryas theory;  basically describes a world ending event (apocolypse) around 12,850 years ago....which sort've falls in line when "atlantis was around"
[4:03:24] dannibrew: Yeah Joe should have you on the show
[4:03:32] Ilove_togetwet: AJ BiS

[4:21:08] jimbonni: its like pala just of heal ur warrior boys
[4:21:11] qqmastha: kek as feral u have mana for 4 morph bro ull be happy to heal yourself if
[4:21:11] JoeBangles_: a place for me headdd
[4:21:13] Blide: @b1azzuris what class do you main?
[4:21:13] jimbonni: EZ
[4:21:25] kcm92: i feel like moonkin form is pointless because it prevents you from being a hybrid
[4:21:27] b1azzuris: @blide boomy
[4:22:03] woozen10: this is hella nostalgic of those old wow pvp videos
[4:22:08] gubgubsr: this event sucks so bad
[4:22:09] jimbonni: HO plays moonking in pvp LOL xD
[4:22:09] macjcool: its so cool
[4:22:12] Shepp22: wild growth is a very quick and easy global. and you should be getting some instant HS’s to toss around. it’s not like wrath and starsurge cost much mana on a rotation
[4:22:12] FleetOfPigeons: Is this a fuckin 2000s pvp montage video? KEKW
[4:22:18] Wooshu: tons of Druids bad tho, I see so many Moonkins get gap closed hamstringed and then dance around rather than going into travel form to get space, heal and go on the offensive
[4:22:22] Mjuggz64: zerg fest i feel like
[4:22:23] jimbonni: i LOVE IT
[4:22:27] outofmanax: its unplayable on eu
[4:22:27] jimbonni: PVE andys don't
[4:22:27] KombatWombat07: it's great in a group im sure
[4:22:29] Viccili: i love it compared to what ashenvale was
[4:22:29] KaizenKam: As prot warrior i hate it
[4:22:29] BlownFuse_: i think theres too many people
[4:22:30] Screamnsteam: this event is hell of alot better then ashenvale
[4:22:38] Th3Whitey: its good and its bad i get robbed
[4:22:39] BigBossDro: Tarren Mill South Shore vibes
[4:22:42] BigBossDro: but in STV
[4:22:43] KombatWombat07: ashenvale was so bad
[4:22:46] Speeddyzz: people who say that probably enjoy the non pvp ashenvale event
[4:22:47] BigBossDro: which is a dope zone
[4:22:50] outofmanax: @KaizenKam asa what?
[4:22:51] xoxoxoxoxo: x1000 times
[4:22:52] Indomitablez: People that usually hate events like this are probably solo or cant find decent players to group with so just get steamrolled.
[4:22:53] Pinzly: I'm a warrior and I hate making parties for it, nobody will take me I always have to do it myself
[4:23:23] KaizenKam: As warrior tank no one inv me or join me for the event i dont even know how i would farm or get enyting from this event
[4:23:24] Pinzly: if you're not a boomkin of shadowpriest good luck find a group
[4:23:43] Pinzly: I just invite any 4 people who want to play
[4:23:49] Pinzly: so to me the event is pretty meh
[4:23:54] jimbonni: LOL
[4:23:55] gubgubsr: theres 0 strat to this
[4:23:58] JoeBangles_: FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM
[4:24:02] GamonHardCore: hello Soni
[4:24:03] gubgubsr: just play meta class and kill, die, respawn
[4:24:06] claynukem: DIO BABY
[4:24:08] jimbonni: boomie is nerd bro
[4:24:08] popitforchrist: i have seen these guys at least 4 times
[4:24:09] gubgubsr: its CoD deathmatch basically
[4:24:12] Mjuggz64: kse
[4:24:13] xbento: HOLY DIVER
[4:24:17] ogLIVE: HOLY DIUVA
[4:24:23] popitforchrist: =both singers
[4:24:26] jimbonni: just get warrior WF bot 2 heals 1 dps
[4:24:31] Wooshu: I wont join groups who only ask for boomkins. they are probably elitists and if I wanted to sweat I would play retail
[4:24:32] vepsee: @SONII  .item 16 216884 it sheaths dumb but it looks pre cool
[4:25:24] xbento: @Wooshu I think retail is the least sweaty of all the current 20 iterations of wow
[4:25:35] xbento: but i do hate to defend retail
[4:25:52] xbento: I'm TORN
[4:25:55] Wooshu: @xbento no way, all the addons make it so everything is min/maxed
[4:26:03] BlownFuse_: this event blows as a warlock cause you have a 10 sec pet summon everytime you die
[4:26:07] BlownFuse_: they need to fix that asap
[4:26:07] KombatWombat07: on the damn tree
[4:26:11] MastaChiefa_: lmao
[4:26:50] BlownFuse_: oh they did?? i havent played in a few days
[4:26:58] BlownFuse_: if they fixed that then thats actually amazing
[4:27:02] Adubington: what weapon is that?
[4:27:15] qqmastha: they fixed it
[4:27:17] Itspattycakes: its great how after all these years of WoW and its expansions and changes, all the players really want is old school pvp in STV
[4:27:34] BlownFuse_: statement retracted them, they making good and quick changes
[4:27:35] BlownFuse_: go them
[4:27:36] Derezzed01: they did nail this pvp event
[4:27:40] vepsee: @SONII .item 16 216884 sheaths weird but its a new weapon added for sod in the files
[4:27:40] c0gnusTV: @Adubington corrupted ashbringer 4Head
[4:27:43] scmilee: howd you get corrupted ashbringer and change race at 40?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!!?
[4:27:45] Derezzed01: now we need a battle royale type of pvp
[4:27:51] Wooshu: New World had fun open world PVP
[4:27:54] scmilee: Kappa
[4:28:06] Itspattycakes: yeah I agree but with retail WoW compared to this old school plays, some people havent left their roots
[4:28:23] Itspattycakes: something nostalgic about this hahah
[4:28:27] Th3Whitey: is your healer getting blood?
[4:28:32] Hestert: Sonii do you think theyll use azshara for a future phase pvp zone?
[4:28:38] Derezzed01: wait how did they fix the lag wtf
[4:29:04] Th3Whitey: sick
[4:29:12] mattyicey25: !music
[4:29:12] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxH2q9VhEXM
[4:29:15] nixxor: what is that lol

[4:29:39] ndras: depends when u play, EU is fine at late night, slideshow during the day
[4:29:40] mattyicey25: Song?
[4:29:49] Wooshu: 300k HP
[4:29:58] vepsee: its the sword model the stv boss uses pre sure
[4:30:07] chronixx831: can you kill that?
[4:30:13] Huxi_Mont: @mattyicey25 Sounds like Disarmonia Mundi, maybe celestial furnace?
[4:30:29] mattyicey25: @Huxi_Mont Thank you
[4:30:39] chronixx831: nope
[4:30:39] Wooshu: I dont know of anyone killing the STV world boss
[4:30:46] GTokie: i mean have you ever tried hitting an icecube?
[4:30:50] RetroMetros: That sword is the same as the big boss'
[4:30:53] Derezzed01: bro this pvp event is sick af
[4:31:04] Honeypaw: NERF WARRIORS
[4:31:06] Huxi_Mont: Damn do I know my music or what soniiCool
[4:31:21] ProSkillin: whats the point of the boss?
[4:31:57] manletsword: odaCap
[4:32:02] MaximumSerg: WHERES YOUR  HEART
[4:32:07] Wooshu: I wonder if the STV boss drops anything. I guess we will find out in the next Phase when going back to STV
[4:32:14] KingEmil_of_Norway: pepeJAM
[4:32:49] jimbonni: bro what ur build ?

[4:34:13] vepsee: Im curious what next brackets event gonna be
[4:34:19] Mjuggz64: is this billy talent?
[4:34:21] JuanseGamerTv: !server
[4:34:21] Nightbot: SOD - Crusader Strike (RPPvP) Horde ; HC - Defias Pillager Alliance
[4:34:41] vepsee: no
[4:34:46] St0nedCan00k: LUL
[4:34:53] azzy_dog: no it's my chemical disco
[4:34:57] c0gnusTV: crusader strike seems very horde dominant these days
[4:34:58] ndras: blasted lands would be dope pvp zone
[4:35:03] Shepp22: it’s my chemical romance
[4:35:04] whatsupdoc7: probably EPL? with the towers already there
[4:35:10] HexxanTV: this is my chemical romance
[4:35:10] kidjush: this is sick
[4:35:13] HexxanTV: funny sonii
[4:35:17] KaizenKam: What build you use for tanking ?
[4:35:20] gubgubsr: probably not EPL for 50
[4:35:32] gubgubsr: my guess is ungoro
[4:35:37] Thatlaxbro: A TAURN?? but ur an undead wut
[4:36:06] vepsee: if sunken temple is next phase raid, they could do like blasted lands
[4:36:07] vepsee: for the event
[4:36:15] macjcool: ST is my guess
[4:36:22] Eurrekka: black rock mountain lol
[4:36:31] macjcool: aszura is empty af though for sure
[4:36:31] ImGravycakes: i hope its st
[4:36:36] Wooshu: eww unken Temple
[4:36:48] Bee_On_Co: Good group. GGs!
[4:37:06] Astralthundr: absolutely put the next pvp event in ungoro, i wanna see people get shit stomped by the devilsaurs lol
[4:37:07] Shreddingly: Sunken temple makes sense. It is huge and underused
[4:37:11] Wooshu: choose the dungeons people dont like to run?
[4:37:14] ndras: SM should be raid instead of gnomes
[4:37:15] wheeezyp: as minimal as possible
[4:37:43] gubgubsr: ZF raid would be fun
[4:37:47] Sneakzx: just good ol world pvp
[4:37:59] Wooshu: What if the next PVP zone was just straight up faction vs faction, most kills after 30 minutes
[4:37:59] Curtbrainfre3z: goofyass sword on ur back
[4:38:02] brennydigital: really good having it free for all as well to eliminate faction imbalance
[4:38:10] vepsee: they're def doing dungeons people hate/dont run
[4:38:12] vepsee: normally
[4:38:15] Indomitablez: Uldaman raid
[4:38:18] Feromone: dude how do u have so much health? lol
[4:38:19] gubgubsr: ST, mara and ZF next phase thats it
[4:38:19] justjcherry: mara would be big enough
[4:38:33] gubgubsr: BRD maybe?
[4:38:41] Feromone: 1952 with rez sick is insane
[4:38:47] Shreddingly: Most of the player base already spends alot of time in dungeons such as sfk sm uldaman BRD zf mauraudon. It seems to me they try to make dungeons people visit only once or 0 time when leveling as raids
[4:38:54] nandopkwow: sword 2h what enchanted?
[4:38:57] ndras: @gubgubsr brd kinda small for a raid
[4:38:58] macjcool: lvl 50 lbrs or urbrs raid noam
[4:39:26] ndras: what about Mara, Mara is yuge
[4:39:38] Wooshu: you know whats going to funny, after BRD AND Gnomer.. Molten Core is gonna be a cake walk joke
[4:39:38] vepsee: I hope they do something cool with caverns of time
[4:39:39] vepsee: in sod
[4:39:41] Deatharmor98: BRD bigger than Mara i feel
[4:39:59] gubgubsr: brd is massive
[4:39:59] macjcool: imagine how crazy MC will be based on how things are going
[4:40:14] Shreddingly: Ubrs is already a 10man :)
[4:40:17] gubgubsr: ring of law in raid would be cool
[4:40:17] Derezzed01: 100% they need to make them hard
[4:40:17] macjcool: oh for sure
[4:40:18] ndras: same i wanna see no clear first week or 2, would be so good
[4:40:23] Freedog: they will use season of mastery mechanics probably
[4:40:23] vepsee: they'll def buff the old raids, considering they're buffing gear already
[4:40:25] vepsee: from those
[4:40:28] Derezzed01: They should make everything hard
[4:40:31] Derezzed01: I agree
[4:40:42] voteforpedro064: I was one of the casters in that tree that you charged. lol
[4:40:43] jimbonni: what  warrior runes ur using for pvp?
[4:40:46] irate____: have you dps'd gnomer or only tanked trying to figure out what runes to run
[4:40:55] Shreddingly: I think we can expect season of mastery at lvl 60
[4:40:59] GTokie: if they take a page out of, i think runescapes book, and let the players decide the content, that would be omegapog
[4:41:08] vepsee: im surprised gnomer hasnt gotten nerfed hard yet, are the casual dad guilds full clearing?
[4:41:10] voteforpedro064: my group ended up getting you once or twice and got got a couple times. that was a good STV
[4:41:11] manletsword: osrs has the correct way to go about content
[4:41:14] Derezzed01: Well pvp is the most important aspect of classic wow so more events/insances/bg's awards
[4:41:16] manletsword: polls
[4:41:25] bwetty: i think they specified the level up raids as not being made too difficult, wonder if theyll be different with endgame content tho
[4:41:27] ndras: what if they cranked it up for ppl who want challenge and give hard mode gear just visual no stats
[4:41:34] gubgubsr: @GTokie Runescape players are in unison and know what they want, WoW players are not/dont know
[4:41:49] Shreddingly: MC bwl etc are more likely to come with season of mastery mechanics rather than classic mechanics
[4:42:11] humzietvx: Cheer100
[4:42:16] humzietvx: Cheer100
[4:42:18] mothcure: t3 warrior look so good best set ever imo
[4:42:23] vepsee: they havent really even changed much of gnomer/pve tbh
[4:42:25] macjcool: they admited that its super hard to balance pvp
[4:42:27] vepsee: p2 has been pretty lack luster
[4:42:30] Deatharmor98: @mothcure T3 Pally up there too
[4:42:31] Cileth: what? they're nerfing boomies and shadow priests (or shifting power to other abilities)
[4:42:34] humzietvx: Cheer100
[4:42:41] thegamermansam: They just nerf priest wtf
[4:42:43] ndras: @macjcool how hard it can be to see numbers go wild for sp, boomie etc
[4:42:49] itbeHootie: they need to make pvp sets for these lower level events that have hella stam on it @SONII
[4:42:51] outofmanax: its all the hybrids crying with their hyperfocus tunnelvision on raid performance
[4:42:53] GTokie: didnt they literally buff priests this morning
[4:42:54] Playonwordz: damn just got 981 coins this event
[4:42:57] Cileth: it's been a week tho for p2
[4:42:58] Shreddingly: Hmm I am not sure. Isn't 90% of phase 2 warriors pvp related?
[4:43:00] BroccoliTom: "warrior, for example"
[4:43:02] Wooshu: uh oh warrior rant incoming
[4:43:05] mothcure: @Deatharmor98 For me warrior and Warlock are top for sure
[4:43:09] jschroe3: mage in prebis gear i have so little health i cant do shit in pvp
[4:43:15] vepsee: they havent nerfed melee hunter in pve, or nerfed the armor values of some bosses in gnomer, seems like they're taking this phase slow on buffs/nerfs
[4:43:30] ndras: true pvp sets would be dope, more stam less primary stat
[4:43:32] zanthixx: is it me or there not really anything to do at 40?
[4:43:35] Shreddingly: Which new warrior runes besides slam is really pve orientated
[4:43:35] Outplayrs: i know dude im already raid logging p2 :(
[4:43:42] Wooshu: Im not even mad at the Moonkin nerfs. I dominated in Phase 1
[4:43:49] r0nin_xd: dont temp me with a good time
[4:43:51] thegamermansam: The 4k armor in gnomer is suppose to be like that
[4:43:57] idm_beistet: warrior runes are so bland its insane
[4:43:58] Shreddingly: That's p1
[4:44:03] Shreddingly: P2?
[4:44:04] Carepai: flag good in pvp :D
[4:44:07] GTokie: @GTokie true youre never gonna make everyone happy
[4:44:08] BroccoliTom: "im not gonna rant about warrior"
[4:44:30] ndras: and its all on feet LUL
[4:44:45] Bee_On_Co: Dipping, going to watch some UFC. GGs! Pleasure to heal ya.
[4:44:49] thetosis: starting to sound rantish
[4:44:50] Shepp22: that instant slam 6sex cd must be good. unless it shares a slot with something better
[4:44:59] vepsee: muted
[4:45:02] xoxoxoxoxo: herr weee goo the rant
[4:45:04] BroccoliTom: you know i love your rants papi
[4:45:22] KingEmil_of_Norway: NOTED
[4:45:37] jupiterzug: i feel like warbringer is still going to be bis at 6t0 for pvp, they might have to bring something crazy out for chest to be worth considering like bladestorm or something @SONII
[4:45:38] baldnfattv: raging blow is also only doing 60% not 80
[4:45:56] Shepp22: as a Druid I’m hoping for more passive feral runes
[4:45:57] vepsee: yeah idk if I can play all of phase 2 like I did for 1, 2-3 months of this shit and im already getting bored
[4:46:03] outofmanax: @jupiterzug why would it have to be rplaced
[4:46:13] Diculas: What is that sword?
[4:46:34] fafoo204: i think SoD is fun if you like PvP
[4:46:38] jirkasaurus: you make warrior look so fun een with the rant
[4:46:59] Cileth: feel like quick strike is the weirdest rune...does so low damage. Now at 40 have instant attacks with slam rune + ms. So it's like just there to press instead of heroic strike?
[4:47:01] jupiterzug: @outofmanax just saying it's a crazy rune that got released p1 and it's probably the most pvp oriented rune atm
[4:47:01] fafoo204: SoD seems giga boring if you're a pve andy. Unless u just raid on like 6 chars
[4:47:04] JarvanDreadlord: but we could be having way more fun
[4:47:06] xZYDECOx: xZYDECOx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[4:47:07] N_durance: SoD is pvp... people just need to chill and if they dont enjoy a phase unsub and wait for the next
[4:47:09] veiloflonelystars: @vepsee play first month, wait for next phase, lots of things to do in life
[4:47:15] Wooshu: Sonii and Baheera the Warriors of WOW streamers
[4:47:30] xZYDECOx: ❤️
[4:47:33] ZwoopINC: Changed to my sp and mage for pvp instead of my warr , now im having fun again :)
[4:47:37] Diculas: @SONII Are you using some transmog addon? what is that sword
[4:47:49] OlympicUSA: Its your fault if you are playing 12 hours a day and are bored
[4:47:51] jimbonni: pvp is biss guys :o
[4:48:01] Wooshu: Death Knight
[4:48:08] Nightbot: instagram.com/Sonii // Twitter.com/Sonii // youtube.com/Sonii
[4:48:17] haamposrs: sword?
[4:48:19] veiloflonelystars: @OlympicUSA true but also its like people demand to be playing all the time like they can't take a break after 1 month of enjoying the new phase
[4:48:26] Wooshu: AV is 50

[4:49:08] veiloflonelystars: im seing them go wild with endgame content at 60
[4:49:12] Wooshu: I highly doubt we get anything new in classic. I dont even know what classic plus is and neither do the devs
[4:49:18] veiloflonelystars: theres lots of potential for things to do
[4:49:33] jimbonni: bro i got rev in 3 days only 87 silver coins

[4:50:36] nebby1122233: anyone feel this phase isnt as hype as phase 1
[4:50:37] jimbonni: u can do coins till rev

[5:24:26] Concani_: i love Soldier Side from SOAD, probably one of the most underrated song
[5:24:28] BroccoliTom: independent artists make ALOT from plays if theyre popular, labels take alot
[5:24:30] c0gnusTV: and touring the money is all for the band they dont have to cut it with labels and w/e
[5:24:40] pkwy: you get paid the most % for live shows
[5:24:49] dj_efx: unless they have a 360 deal
[5:25:08] imnotagodx: fucking banger
[5:25:14] BroccoliTom: depending on how popular you are, the headliner is handling venue costs
[5:25:29] CJRecords420: what even is that weapon you ahve mog'd
[5:25:31] donkeypeanut: thats why u see most artists sell t-shirts for like 60$
[5:25:36] GTokie: alot of money is from merch
[5:25:38] Anjeus: Privet, bratishka 👋 How's it going?
[5:25:41] dft_kekwplays: @SONII What race is this warrior?
[5:25:51] sremmus87: taylor swift was making 13mil per show in the eras tour

[5:26:01] ramfunky: You can message and ask what they charge
[5:26:10] Zarlus: They are actually paid via engagments
[5:26:10] Youtube_Historian: shirts cost $4-5 to make and they sell for $50
[5:26:12] dj_efx: idk what bands cost but i used to work at a club where we booked hiphop and edm acts. hiphop guys make alot to do 1-3 songs
[5:26:18] donkeypeanut: bro, the g59merchandise merch sells like hot cakes and its expensive, g59 is $uicideboys...
[5:26:20] Huxi_Mont: Too bad Merch is always a scam, I swear I've prolly seen 100 or so bands live and been to countless festivals and the merch quality is always just fruit of the loom or Grindan quality marked up to 60$ a shirt
[5:26:23] pkwy: labels are like loans for most artists, they dont get out of debt till they pay back the initial investment
[5:26:37] Zarlus: Most of their income comes from ENGAGEMENTS...
[5:26:40] killanyoux: artist make 75k+ on ticket sales

[5:27:07] BroccoliTom: @SONII you saw midnight live?  what did you think?  i was disappointe by their live quality, but that was like 4 years ago
[5:27:16] pkwy: if u start a clothing company im tryna cop that asap
[5:27:16] donkeypeanut: fashion sells.
[5:27:17] GTokie: where can i get my soniidigital merch
[5:27:18] popitforchrist: !song
[5:27:31] ramfunky: Plus it would depend on what show, if they playing at Aftershock then they gonna do it for less cause more exposure and other huge bands, where as if they are headlining a show with smaller bands then they charge more since they aren't getting as much exposure
[5:27:33] Huxi_Mont: Still cant believe you got hooked on Midnight when I told you about them when you were looking for non DMCA music LuL
