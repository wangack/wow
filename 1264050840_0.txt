[7:04:20] ZamZam93: if feels weird to me that someone who ranks to 14 says the doesnt want to grind in retail
[7:04:28] ZamZam93: which is way easier
[7:04:37] imephissto: rift farm is basically u get 5 ppl in a group, enter rift, go into 1 of 2 spots in the maw, geet 4-6 elite mobs together, kill them, loot. disband group and whoever has the elites on his server invites everyone again and u do that over and over
[7:04:56] 7Fuchs: the system is for rookies like you Kappa
[7:05:06] bulljr3: but everything you do in classic is a grind.
[7:05:08] griffitv: 80 renown doesnt get you bis gear for 3 phases rank 14 grind deos
[7:05:12] Henrik1206: Easier but less fun :P
[7:05:30] rookie286: the retail gameplay sucks thats why the classic grind is bearable
[7:05:32] imephissto: and there is an item now for 500g where u learn ALL conduits on lvl 200
[7:05:33] ZamZam93: 239 is pvp
[7:05:44] Archendas: retail is to much grind just to play some pvp and have decent pvp gear
[7:05:45] vallah_brathahn: Went in there like a true Warrior
[7:05:47] 20yyears: @imephissto this sound terrible
[7:06:04] holypalaswe: yeah 80 renown is impossible to get
[7:06:09] voidcall1: the parasitic design of retail's grindy stuff is what keeps me away, I might return, but spending so much time on grinding stuff that gets invalidated in next patch is just ridiculous

[11:55:22] ElazulTF2: @Kiki_098 The more players are in the r13 the more honor you need to be in r13. so if people get 1 000 000 000 honor they could still get r14, there's no determined number of spots in R14, its just that the more people are grinding at the same time, the harder it is

[11:56:34] ElazulTF2: @Kiki_098 if you play on a private or empty server with only 100 people grinding, you can get r13 by playing few games per day, but on a highly populated server, because only the very top % get the best placements, you need more and more and more honor

It will take 2–3 months straight of grinding 12–14 hours (minimum) per day. At least 3–4 weeks of hardcore grinding just go from rank 13 to rank 14.
