His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[0:39:05] ditchdigger456: Cdank is an actual agent, I swear to God. I've seen him not only get himself killed but also many others in groups and raids. His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[5:52:06] ditchdigger456: Cdank is an actual agent, I swear to God. I've seen him not only get himself killed but also many others in groups and raids. His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.

[5:55:52] ditchdigger456: Cdank is an actual agent, I swear to God. I've seen him not only get himself killed but also many others in groups and raids. His positioning, his squirrel brain, just isn't cut out to be a tank. However, this can't all be blamed on him, as it's a positioning error by the group as a whole, but holy shit just be extra mindful. For those that don't know this is what 200 hours down the drain looks like. At this level it's a kick in the nuts and you just want to lay down and cry.  󠀀
