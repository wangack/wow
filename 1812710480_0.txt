[4:14:35] MARTZiiE: Sepulcher is when method was like world 3rd right. ?
[4:15:16] Drizz_36: if liquid or echo ever stopped doing RWF then there would be no more RWF because one of those two will always win
[4:15:24] zarod89: I would love to see limited attempts per week, just to focus on player skill rather than resources
[4:15:30] GodKingMuninn: So are we placing bets on there being artificer xy'mox in 10.2 raid or 11.0 raid

[5:36:24] reggiepowa: patch actually starts next week to be fair

[5:36:47] valianya: It'll be a different breakdown when season 2 actually starts, its still old content till then
[5:36:47] mavericks312: imagine watching 18 yr old content
[5:36:56] vulkankragon: don't you think its better classic gets a new sub channel on twitch and separate it from retail?
[5:36:57] Yraye: tbh 10.1 doesnt offer much and in one month the d4 release
[5:37:00] Sarocus: I have absolutely zero craps to give about RWF
[5:37:10] Chibrotle: it's a compounding issue, classic andys are super passionate and for the first time since release classic content is relevant.
[5:37:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: Some of the PvP guys were doing retail but so many of the viewers wanted to see them in hardcore, they are doing it until season 2 starts
[5:37:15] Chibrotle: hence the viewership
[5:37:18] EKS90_: "fix it " to me there  is nothing to "fix", shouldnt it be a good thing people are watching wow and playing wow no matter what version?

[5:39:57] Iconic_k: cata isnt bad tf
[5:40:00] szble: mop would be so good though
[5:40:01] EKS90_: i raid in retail and i play classic era, but to me vanilla wow has a certain feel no other version has, which is why I still play both.
[5:40:02] PopeJonas: What did cata bring? beside LFR and RBGS
[5:40:02] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they should rebrand it a progression server instead of Classic Cataclysm, and do all the expansions
[5:40:04] its_andyd: sure they can
[5:40:14] vulkankragon: i think majority of classic hc streamers and viewers will migrate to D4 hardcore next month
[5:40:16] Deydralon: Skip the Classic Shadowlands Stare
[5:40:18] Thoreya: Ya but who cares lol f Cata
[5:40:19] reggiepowa: wod was a failure, pretty sure they can skip that one if they get there
[5:40:21] Thoreya: :)
[5:40:22] Epicsapphire1988: i quite for years for cata - hated it lol
[5:40:22] Armdel: not even after all this time
[5:40:26] StraightErro: wrath, cuz everyone now knows what happens to Arthas in Shadowlands, ruining the ICC ending, nobody wants to see him done dirty like that
[5:40:33] Goodnevi1: Do cata for only 3-6 months
[5:40:47] staticpulsed: its also a major setup  for the current
[5:40:50] Densetsu_: They can make a "Cataclysm 2.0" though, make something new Kappa
[5:40:53] EKS90_: IU think MoP and cata shouldn't happen, its to "close" to retail, same world, pandaria talents just got changed in this expansion etc
[5:40:54] diamondlikewrist: go before first wow mind fuck them
[5:40:56] EKS90_: I think*
[5:41:04] its_andyd: they conceded with draenor and shadowlands
[5:41:05] Z_Man23: they COULD but it would be a bad look
[5:41:09] siobhannian: not a complete failure -- but storyline ..... i don't know .. i thought it wasn't finalized before the release
[5:41:10] Red_Dead_Redeem: cata was the worst expansion IMO
[5:41:19] valianya: It would hurt shareholder pockets with a show of lack of confidence in product
[5:41:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: Dungeon finder will get more people involved
[5:41:30] Densetsu_: LFR can fuck off LUL
[5:41:35] DunzoCD: false shadowlands and Wod were the worst LUL
[5:41:39] dokor: the horror

[5:42:10] Red_Dead_Redeem: nah WOD PvP  was good and SL had some good raids
[5:42:10] 3663Sharad: I guess launching without LFD in WotLK classic killed it also really fast for many
[5:42:16] GrovekeeperTV: Is guardian bear looking good atm?
[5:42:16] Visuals66: I got 402 Pants on my mage

[5:43:12] FroNukem: @Towelliee when u turn in the 1500 rep quest u get a chest
[5:43:14] Broomba: What’s the keys for @towelliee
[5:43:21] StreamElements: Use code FACTORSE36440 for 50% off your first box at https://strms.net/factor75_towelliee
[5:43:25] EKS90_: Exactly.
[5:43:34] Visuals66: I loved Cata because Ret was OP as hell and PvP was fun
[5:43:37] Iconic_k: spine was fun on anything but lfr soooo
[5:43:39] DunzoCD: and the world got changed people hated that
[5:43:40] mavericks312: if it wasnt for spine/deathwing fights Cata is a top tier xpac
[5:43:41] vulkankragon: atleast wow still has twitch viewership. look at other mmorpgs, almost no viewership at all.
[5:43:50] HopeThePriest: Firelands was dope
[5:43:52] SS_Nynaeve: cata is good stuff i hope they drop it classic
[5:43:53] Goodnevi1: The dungeons were tuned to 1000 too casuals couldn't handle it
[5:43:57] its_andyd: cata was poggers
[5:43:58] HopeThePriest: Class balance was decemt to
[5:44:02] PvtHudson093: Cata took away some of the most epic quests
[5:44:03] Iconic_k: people were just ass at the game then
[5:44:07] its_andyd: even madness of deathwing was poggers
[5:44:10] EKS90_: BWD,BoT firelands are fucking amazing raids
[5:44:20] Jindo_ZG: I would be happy to just have a fresh start Vanilla server without having to worry about it closing like Season
[5:44:43] CardinalTX: Ive just played the game and enjoyed each expansion.
[5:44:49] pereadin: WoW dominates mmo viewership
[5:44:54] pereadin: Always will imo
[5:44:54] mavericks312: whats crazy is taht DF is an amazing xpac
[5:45:17] Araxnus: What about final fantasy?
[5:45:25] CardinalTX: I will say ive been having fun playing GW2 again
[5:45:30] Iconic_k: people talking about quests like anyone cares about leveling in retail anymore lol
[5:45:54] EKS90_: that is why i think cata classic would be weird, cause its content you can still play here on retail, you cannot play the vanilla world anymore, removing that in "classic" makes it feel not classic anymore, IMO that is.
[5:45:55] Thoreya: That FF stuff was almost 2 year ago lol
[5:46:00] reggiepowa: what's the reason for that, not enough entertaining streamers or the game is just bad for streaming?

[5:46:24] wEiRdO_dUdE: In Final Fantasy those viewers ditch after the story is done, that's true
[5:46:52] mavericks312: @Ribastur0075 yea it is right now but S2 hasnt started yet so retail will pick up
[5:46:55] vulkankragon: the endgame content in ff14 is extremely lackluster
[5:47:07] Thoreya: If u want a quick viewership swing FF msq is ur friend LUL but after that rip
[5:47:10] Armdel: meanwhile i skip MSQ streams because spoilers
[5:47:56] EKS90_: The people I know that play FF14 on a regular basis, do what most of the communtiy does in wow, ffarm mounts and tranmogs etc.
[5:48:00] EKS90_: and that is not FUN to watch.
[5:48:01] CardinalTX: Any news on Rich lately?  He in deep shit?
[5:48:17] Chibrotle: he said he was going to make a statement, he didn't

[5:53:24] Visuals66: I pvpd in Cata and Mop it was so much fin back then
[5:53:24] shadowreath93: its hard to pvp nowadays you need 15,000 addons to track 10,000 cooldowns and cc
[5:53:27] lucid_wow: raid is prob low bc a lot of pve players do both and m+ is more accessible since u need 5 not 20
[5:53:58] Thoreya: i also think the whole "pvp is dead" thing is so exagerrated. lot of people still pvp lol
[5:54:12] Thoreya: just ppl complain a lot about it

[5:57:12] DunzoCD: idk if shadow is the best starter for a new player
[5:57:14] wEiRdO_dUdE: You can play any spec in the game, really, but it's just going to be a little more of a challenge on some specs
[5:57:29] Rhiinehart: you enjoy vortex?
[5:57:33] Eviltuna13: Priest because they got the best looking tier itesm this patch
[5:57:37] MetalJoshP: I mean you can start with any class really now if you like the play style I would just watch some videos on how they work before
