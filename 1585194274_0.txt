[1:55:22] Korupcija_: blizzard hates money
[1:55:27] mavericks312: is that for like benediction,fairlina, and grobbulus?
[1:55:37] abracka_: some random person on the forums legit told blizzard "i'm looking at the server population on old blanchy right now and it's dead"
[1:55:42] Alepouditsa: O.O

[1:56:28] negxrevolution: uh ohhhhhh
[1:56:37] Alepouditsa: wait do we can't make evokers
[1:56:37] abracka_: the new server eranikus or w/e is already locked
[1:56:41] Korupcija_: good thing I made a lvl 1 character on every realm KEKW
[1:56:42] Alepouditsa: ohh ok
[1:56:48] pavepawns: @Towelliee whats ur opinion on the lvl increasing over multiple raid bosses and not just last 2-3?
[1:56:56] negxrevolution: sheesh
[1:57:20] Lycis: So Blizz wants you to play FFXIV instead bc there the locked servers are only temporarily
[1:57:23] Alepouditsa: i resendly moved to silvermoon danHype
[1:57:53] zuna1904: i have a crazy idea. CONNECT the servers. xrealm stuff etc Give Players LFD. Its 2022. I wanna PLAY the Game not bath in nostalgic feelings of how awesome it was 13 years ago
[1:58:16] Lycis: 3-4 times higher PogChamp PogChamp
[1:58:18] szble: Kappa
[1:58:30] ObamaEnvy: Old Blanchy forever!
[1:58:33] pk99: less than 10k? Dead!
[1:58:33] Fortvila: 4 times 0 is still 0
[1:58:34] SpoonManes: he sed you wrong
[1:58:43] smolglizzy: My toons are eligible for xfer soon and i can't wait to get them off Benediction tbh.
[1:58:49] Mecabeast: so only 25% of the players are max level and doing content
[1:58:49] looney199725: blizz tired of people talkin fake news
[1:59:03] motorboatingpro: why are there any servers at this point?
[1:59:03] zuna1904: the solution is so simple
[1:59:21] zuna1904: no. just make it like retail :D
[1:59:22] abracka_: they said the servers are already at max capacity with current tech
[1:59:24] negxrevolution: I hope waited 5 hours to play been playin since 10 last night
[1:59:27] SirVoro: Just shard more 4Head its so easy
[1:59:47] WingsDub: facts they let all the dead servers transfer to grobb
[1:59:47] zuna1904: who would stop playing wotlk classic because xrealm and lfd exist ?
[1:59:56] rohdey: classic blizzard self made problem?
[2:00:04] noosphear: The real problem is that this is just prepatch.  Launch of WotLK is going to be REAL interesting.
[2:00:07] Screamnsteam: i took computer science in high school, i know how it works 4Head
[2:00:11] Aquadriel: i meant hey are classic players, thy deserve a worse experience KEKW
[2:00:17] zuna1904: it makes no sense. its 2022 :D
[2:00:21] zuna1904: not 2009
[2:00:26] pavepawns: wait hasnt wrath already launched?
[2:00:28] Korupcija_: just log in 6h early and you're fine
[2:00:43] Skizzurp: blizz gonna make a cut the line pass for sale in the blizz shop for wotlk launch
[2:00:49] Phil87z: Why donât the mega retail severs have queues?
[2:00:55] abracka_: they said something about people not being able to login with multiple accounts on the same device now as well
[2:01:01] Lycis: Who would've thought WotLK would be so popular SoonerLater PixelBob
[2:01:03] zenFX_: they could transfer but they are stubborn and wont because their favourite streamer wont be on the other realm
[2:01:05] looney199725: @Phil87z they do?
[2:01:06] WingsDub: log in queues "dont you have phones"
[2:01:13] BlewGamingGroup: and its funny that streamers want to talk to blizz devs about ways to alleviate the queue times but absolutely dont want to take the free transfer to other servers
[2:01:27] Arociak: what music is that?
[2:01:30] szble: did illidan have a q at SL release
[2:01:43] FryeTV: No illidan didnt.
[2:01:43] Aquadriel: also because retail has an even heavier shard/phasing infrastructure which allows faster log ins over all @Towelliee
[2:01:45] Wadjaah: To increase server capacity it means they have to rework how their database request system I guess and I guess it's something too big to be done in a short amount of time
[2:01:49] Ariea_Whisper: We also have cross realm
[2:01:53] marineboi1288: area 52 had a que for shadowlands
[2:01:54] Mecabeast: we did for shadowlands I had to wait an hour
[2:01:58] motorboatingpro: A52 did, stormrage for like a day too
[2:02:01] szble: yeah i dont remember one just server issues
[2:02:03] looney199725: eu had qeues
[2:02:06] Lycis: "We didn't know it was that popular" PixelBob
[2:02:09] abracka_: "I also just want to reiterate this point though; weâve raised population caps to accommodate mega-realms to the absolute limit of current technology"
[2:02:09] ForgottenTime: SL sergaras has a queue
[2:02:10] FryeTV: @marineboi1288 A52 is biggest realm in retail.
[2:02:11] Lorilath: eu nornally has queues on expac release

[2:02:23] mavrikbtw: Grob wati time is 4+ hours after 2pm
[2:02:25] Dreem_TV: My Skyfury queue last night was 4 hourse
[2:02:28] WingsDub: 5 hours last night on grobb at 6pm CST
[2:02:33] A_Gosling: Meanwhile no queue but plenty of players on RP server - life is good on a "dead" server
[2:02:41] SmallzzIV: just log in before you go to work and you will only wait an hour when you get home... easy
[2:02:42] marineboi1288: benediction yesterday around 4 to 5 was like a 10k plus player wait
[2:02:43] Ithylz: Aren't there more people playing Classic than retail atm?
[2:02:48] zoltankanjimos: 4 to 5
[2:02:50] Brodih_: queue on Benediction starts around noon now
[2:03:01] Elseworldz: Yeah I'm on Azuresong and it's suuuuuper dead.
[2:03:03] BlewGamingGroup: people are remote desktopping in from work at lunch to make sure they are close to logged in once home
[2:03:42] Ithylz: Sure yes
[2:03:55] looney199725: on launch for df i wont be logged off for like 24 hours in advance boi haha

[2:05:02] Arociak: good synergy with blood and thunder
[2:05:11] Tiamarilien: for shadowlands, didn't have queue, thankfully, b/c portal didn't spawn for me and I had to relog - stormrage.
[2:05:13] Mecabeast: @odinslayer lik3ly not worth cause it basically dbls the cd of heroic leap
[2:05:16] Theopt: I'm still surprised how they don't say what is the chance

[2:07:31] TheItalianStallion321: i agree Towel

[4:04:59] Glynn11: @looney199725 lol totally agree
[4:05:34] caspre01: maybe it doesnt work on enemy in combat
[4:05:41] krobane: @Towelliee how badly are DH's getting shafted in Dragonflight?
[4:05:58] Valzark: warriors have grip now?
[4:06:04] caspre01: ye, should be a bug indeed
[4:06:04] MFAM_THE_Steven: They grip in front of you. Unlike gore fiends which grips on top of you
[4:06:06] overshot14: Is this all default ui?
[4:06:08] Rastailian: @towelliee happy start of the NFL season
[4:06:12] JBonezey: maybe that specific mob had antimovement or stun type mechanics
[4:06:15] Masqerader: it would be pretty pointless to not be able to use on enemies in combat
[4:06:23] looney199725: @krobane havoc doing great

[4:06:50] Keirmot: That makes it clunky, imo
[4:06:51] critikals78: Does prot warrior feel pretty good in DF?
[4:07:01] TheZander: maybe the randomizer does not work so it cant pull 4 if there are more than 4
[4:07:03] lunchbox8669: idk it just showed in an ad
[4:07:07] JBonezey: Imagine testing in Beta
[4:07:15] potms_botm: maybe point of impact needs same distance from the mobs to be pulled in
[4:07:21] potms_botm: som*
[4:07:26] potms_botm: some*
[4:07:27] biddy17: Thatâs most likely like a DK group it doesnât work on some mobs
[4:07:55] JBonezey: There are mobs that have antimovement and anti stun type mechanics, could have been one of them being a larger "Rock" type dude
[4:08:01] AlphasaurusRexx: dk grip works on all mobs lvl 60 or lower

[4:34:10] soge131: @Towelliee , does druid bring in Mark of the wild or they removed it?
[4:34:22] wEiRdO_dUdE: Prot warrior could be the meta tank for raids, bear for Mythic+
[4:34:28] Autoexeq: In Shadowlands the meta was kiting so first patch Demon Hunter was the only tank getting keys
[4:34:31] Raiiincloud: Or a Mistweaver
[4:34:42] Masqerader: there is only one true meta and name was walter white
[4:34:44] Utmost777: were there any good Pally changes recently?
[4:34:48] neverbornlucky: Towellie I'm not feeling the dragon flight pre-order and I'm having fun with wrath classic. If I do not see much of a reason to get the basic order of dragon flight for pre patch and play wow do you think just getting digital copy on release makes sense ?
[4:34:50] Tiamarilien: I got dc'd from ptr from all the ppl in sw testing out the trees on the dummies. My prot pally feels a little slow compared to what I feel on live, but that's expected early in a xpac. Going to get something to eat, then try my dk.

[4:35:43] looney199725: but the DF version of brewmaster is looking great
[4:35:56] Hyundrood: bears need some love :( it looks way better to play than the SL version but something is missing
[4:35:56] Funderik: will raid testing go on ptr or beta? at the rate they are working, it could be in a couple weeks.
[4:36:10] sanctus360: Thoughts on felhunter revert?
[4:36:22] hadihajri1: hi @Towelliee i am new to tanking how to get good in tanking?
[4:36:59] soge131: DK and DH grips work because you dont randomly drop the mobs on top of you, you do that in a high keys and those mobs are gonna destroy your back
[4:37:07] elvance08: How is warrior doing in DF atm?
[4:37:22] ArcaneSyntax: paladin needs some love

[4:39:49] Daarksyde: so its for PVP then
[4:39:50] adameek__: @Towelliee How's Prot Pally doing in DF?
[4:39:51] Cordrann: It seems too weak to give up mobility for
[4:39:58] apb89: Every tank is getting some new stuff and itâs all looking good. Vengeance darkness and blur are huge for them
[4:40:12] apb89: Blood getting more grips
[4:40:16] Wcvechten: Have you seen the 1h strength weapon from Neltharus? it seems crazy good
[4:40:20] ExoVert: does prot have decent self sustain and damage in DF?

[4:41:17] soge131: If raids are tuned according to new tanks power, they're gonna hit like a truck
[4:41:37] Seerated: Corect, looked way less than 10
[4:41:40] looney199725: @soge131 god forbid they make tanks have to wake up raiding is kinda ZZZ as tank

[4:41:46] Shaduoken: yea for sure
[4:41:47] angadc420: have the dungeons been fun?
[4:42:07] apb89: I think the tank getting the least, based on what Iâve seen so far, is blood dk. They are meta now, though, and still getting more grips and some other access to frost and unholy stuff

[5:02:36] 91Niki: Queues has nothing to do with that. The game engine has a lot to say with what servers you use. Wow is a very old engine. You can't just attach it to a beast of a server that can hold millions of players. That's just not how game coding works LUL
[5:02:36] JBonezey: You understand that those are no longer capable of security
[5:03:05] JBonezey: Queues have nothing to do with server tech
[5:03:12] rbolude: this dude KEKW
[5:03:14] 91Niki: @eshonxv Mate your ignorance for how game development works is shining through. Just stop, you have zero clue what you are talking about LUL
[5:03:15] JBonezey: Blizzards poor planning has everything to do with queues

[5:03:35] 91Niki: Stop before you make yourself look more stupid
[5:03:42] Mecabeast: @eshonxv are you willing to throw millions of $ at devs to update almost 20yr of net code?
[5:03:55] JBonezey: Blizzard even said that some servers are having 40k transfers, but brah, 20k pservers running 15 year old code..
[5:03:59] kokochris: @eshonxv there is a lot more to it than that my man.  too much to post in a twitch thread.
[5:04:04] Gadris: @eshonxv you over estimate how much you know
[5:04:20] 91Niki: Gotta love peoples ignorance and then speaking like they know what's up KEKW

[5:04:54] 91Niki: Anywho, how's everybody's day going? ijpLOVE
[5:05:10] JBonezey: I completely agree queues are stupid in 2022, but act like pservers running 15 year old mangoOS code don't have queues
[5:05:10] kokochris: @91Niki great ! danLove
[5:05:16] 91Niki: @Sollice No no, put your finger on that button and send me money Kappa

[5:05:40] Sollice: Ok well she took care of it
[5:05:43] Sollice: Thank you!

[5:08:09] 91Niki: @kokochris Good to hear ijpLOVE
[5:08:12] kokochris: There will and always will be a queue of some sort.  You may not notice it, but its there.  this is the nature of connection oriented and connectionless transports which allows for stability and rate limiting.  If you want to know more, go inspect how TCP backlogs work and UDP connection rate limiting.
[5:08:14] krobane: @Rudric_Ice asmon isnt even on....

[6:19:31] MortiousPrime: It's artificial difficulty
[6:19:48] MortiousPrime: People do that in dungeons and dragons to make an encounter last longer and it's a poor tactic

[6:21:40] kalamari__: do they maybe have the anniversary in mind with the leveling xp? because the anniversary with the 18% buff should be active when DF releases, no? @Towelliee
[6:22:03] Obses1998: !keys

[6:22:28] SLoPPYALieN: You can do it Sc00ter!
[6:22:31] WulfricGrim: @kalamari__ The Anniversary Event will likely not effect you beyond 60
[6:22:53] kalamari__: @kalamari__ ah okay. didnt know that
[6:22:54] bigcountry555: i think they should put mount animations for all old mounts
[6:22:56] DarkviperTV: lol that sounded like bane from batman
[6:23:00] WulfricGrim: Healers go oom for sure
[6:23:07] yadungoofed101: deeeeefinitely still go oom at m+ or raiding
[6:23:29] LeDerpski: M+ only ooms in pugs
[6:23:38] WulfricGrim: M+ Depends on the dungeon and key level
[6:23:39] LeDerpski: I never go oom when healing with a guild group
[6:23:43] Rudric_Ice: play arcane mage u will go oom multiple times
[6:23:45] saevenar: healers keep getting affixes that restore mana
[6:23:51] WulfricGrim: 15s, nothing. But in the 25s, definitely can if stuff goes a little weird
[6:23:52] UltraKSlaya: I remember going oom when I played mage
[6:24:07] UltraKSlaya: a looong time ago lol
[6:24:13] Flexxster: oh shit details works ? nice
[6:24:27] Industree: wrath release healing was so bad, I had a macro to warm people to play better because healing was so hard
[6:24:38] Industree: or was that cata?
[6:24:47] Bareno: @Flexxster gotta download the update DF version in the details discord
[6:24:49] WulfricGrim: @Industree That was Cata
[6:24:56] raldrik: id rather get smacked around some then just beat down a huge healthbar with no fear of dieing
[6:25:28] storm99413: Sundered amor from then KEKW
[6:25:30] UltraKSlaya: Cata started hard, it was fun
[6:25:39] Ezekyler: also the mobs apllies sunder armor on the tank make it very weak
[6:26:00] Mecabeast: is the troll dungeon with the room full of snakes a leveling dungeon or max level dungeon
[6:26:11] UltraKSlaya: it helped me get gud fast haha
[6:26:12] Rudric_Ice: hard = ''fun''  Kappa
[6:26:25] xsp00n: idk, there should M+ requires more than 3 ccs XDbe no reason to
[6:26:31] Ezekyler: Cata at early with guildmates or friends was fine, problem was with pugs
[6:26:46] twinkieruler95: @Towelliee how is warrior tanking going is it as good as it looks?
[6:26:53] mebeblood: @Mecabeast gundrak is a leveling dungeon
[6:27:02] Ezekyler: also people was used to rush dungeons like at the end of Wrath
[6:27:09] mebeblood: if thats the dungeon you mean
[6:27:20] Keirmot: My first Grim Batol Heroic took 2 hours to complete
[6:27:42] djfreezingcold: yeah azure span is great
[6:27:52] Seanio7: I first found your youtube channel from your guides on cata heroics
[6:28:02] BreaKereN: So when DF hits, you recommend me to spam dungeons the first few levels? Im a tank aswell
[6:28:14] tylerfeld: @Towelliee do you think the campaign should be designed to get you to 70, even if slower, or forced to do side quests/dungeons
[6:28:37] Mecabeast: @mebeblood I think so I think it's the dungeon where you activate all the totems to turn the bridge
[6:28:37] Moobot: I will be leveling a toon on the NA Fresh Server Maladath (Normal) 8/30 when servers go up. Not doing anything special guild wise just leveling to get a Paladin and DK ready for WOTLK Launch
[6:28:38] Rudric_Ice: did they add the balance druid changes or is it next build ?
[6:28:50] WulfricGrim: I think the campaign, and each Leveling Dungeon Once should be enough to hit cap
[6:29:08] Molvonos: Captain Exposition ftw
[6:29:13] mebeblood: @Mecabeast then yeah definitely leveling dungeon
[6:29:14] Prison__Mike____: Is the Condemn swing animation still there in DF??

[6:30:58] HagermanHour: oh yeah, all main quests, all side, all optionals, it was work to see your next chapter
[6:30:59] Ezekyler: pain*
[6:31:05] Armdel: i only made it too lvl 30 when swtor launched i think
[6:31:10] dudeimunknown: But they could mabye get quests that goes with the lore
[6:31:12] Armdel: mostly because i went back to wow though
[6:31:19] zombie_snacks666: launch was so grindy
[6:31:20] moogasms: EQ 1 was the grindest game ever...
[6:31:33] Ezekyler: Alderaan was too much for me, all the hype for the game died for me there
[6:31:48] Molvonos: @moogasms EQ was grindy, but Runescape was likely more tbh
[6:31:51] ayrisen: ayrisen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[6:32:01] manhooties: Ultima online was a long ass grind
[6:32:08] mebeblood: i was never able to get max level in that warhammer mmo lol
[6:32:11] Industree: I wanted to love wildstar, but the grind turned me away early
[6:32:19] Blastmundr: I wish they would have tuned Wildstar better, was fun while it lasted
[6:32:19] ayrisen: no worries
[6:32:37] SimplyRed: i was the only one in my group of 7 basement dwellers that made it to max level back in those days. everyone else gave up.
[6:32:49] ThinkBucket: wildstar was fun as hell honestly
[6:32:49] Ranzinz: i really enjoyed playing wildstar
[6:32:50] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  is the star on the map the new rare thingy?
[6:33:04] Wildsuit_: old school swtor leveling was fun but gw2 leveling to 80 good god was so long and was pointless at that time

[6:35:06] JDZ1e: I mean I don't care for lore so not bothered about spoilers
[6:35:09] Meccka: Spoil Me BABY
[6:35:11] mebeblood: spoilers dont matter anymore because most of important story in the past happened in books outside of the game which people wouldnt read anyway
[6:35:11] Crypticedge: personally going in blind is so 2007 lol
[6:35:20] mebeblood: it depends on how they change how they deliver the story
[6:35:26] Saphirosa_Dragonaspect: Not anymore. Story isnt going in an interesting direction. And as someone who picked up FF14 in SL, its a massive downgrade of a story we get in WoW
[6:35:59] akaari5486: ff playerbase are from argent dawn rp clown fiesta
[6:36:04] MrGrimms: we datamine everything so we know whats going on

[6:36:35] szble: if i want to be surprised ill play a single player rpg
[6:36:39] UltraKSlaya: I think it easy to miss story in game, people want to know what happens beforehand
[6:36:41] xsp00n: spoilers for wow dont exist, when you find out you find out
[6:37:00] Ezekyler: 235? that's below zerth mortis
[6:37:04] Deadlyguz: no it boils down to WOW devs having no trust and ff devs having the trust of player to give them something good
[6:37:05] MrEvilRex: until Blizz implements systems last minute, ignore beta feedback and pushes new unfinished unpolished grindy system to live servers
[6:37:07] mebeblood: blizzard made it so the story just doesnt matter

[6:38:26] Dopefishy: how often to you die in retail

[7:49:29] Demanisraar: yeah it looks banger, only reason I am doing it
[7:49:31] yib_: the fact that the mount isnt just a store mount is suprising

[8:01:23] TheCliffyShow: It's a minor inconivence to get the mount, but not enough to rage. Will be funny none the less.
[8:01:32] jeffnsteff2019: good news is there is a hurricane south of LA might hit inland for little rleieve

[8:09:46] Nalleys: You need a 55 to create a DK on the new server though, right? KEKW
[8:09:51] Nico_vdM: So many people complaining that they have to wait 5 hours to log into classic realms to do these questline to get mount
[8:09:51] Gutroan: You need to do it untill the faction stuff from what Ive read
[8:09:59] byrdeen45: I didnt know you had to have a 55 already to play a dk
[8:10:02] AlphasaurusRexx: @CLOUDSOFF it takes like an hour lol

[8:10:59] cannibalcanyon: it can be any dk initiate in that area
[8:11:03] TheCliffyShow: Decided to go the meme route instead, and made a female gnome DK named "UwuZombie".

[8:21:46] Nico_vdM: The most annoying quest ever = poking people with those daggers
[8:21:49] comp1: RIP The Queen
[8:21:58] olyv12: I hate the "discover the Scarlet Crusade" quest. Takes forever
[8:22:00] KeidooTV: @stiffy1984 ohh really didn't know thanks for the correction
[8:22:28] SilkeySmooth: so the oct 25th date will be pre patch?
[8:22:30] Stiffy84: @keidootv no prob towHAMUP towHAMUP
[8:22:31] K0rzak0v: how long does it take to finish this starter zone?
[8:22:31] MOXP: but you need to buy wrath addon right?
[8:22:32] SpoonManes: queen elizabeta was a real one for sure rip
[8:22:32] atowellthatiallreadyused: Summon gargoyle is buffed in dragonflight its like dark arbiter in legion
[8:22:41] luckfore: early?? prepatch is in a month lol
[8:22:48] SamAddams: @towelliee did you see THDs take on cross realm fixing the server issue. he's right
[8:22:48] squirrelllllllllll: i heard if you finish the dk starting zone you get a free mount for retail
[8:23:02] Jaqhuir: yes
[8:23:06] cannibalcanyon: yeah its cheap
[8:23:17] velkoff: @Towelliee with what u saw on beta do u think DF will be good to go in ~2m?
[8:23:18] Murry07: Death strike lvl 56 at trainer :)
[8:23:24] cannibalcanyon: youll have enough just from questing and looting kills
[8:23:25] Snabido: @schizotwitchen That would be POGGERS if it makes it to live Kreygasm
[8:23:46] ThinkBucket: which game version do I need to install? i tried WOTLK classic and couldnt make a DK
[8:23:52] Arabus135: Toweliie u are looking great man!
[8:23:59] atowellthatiallreadyused: idd and they got a whole talent tree right side all about pet dmg
[8:24:05] Mitune: Outrage is temporary
[8:24:11] bypized: THATS NOT THE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE Kappa
[8:24:16] kappaday23: Kappa
[8:24:17] xhale2nhale: yea they'll get over it
[8:24:25] Stiffy84: #NOCHANGES crowd towRee towRee towRee
[8:24:32] theoldgodmd: I just don't understand why they don't create ONE megaserver per region like in elder scrolls online and theres that @Towelliee
[8:24:40] Daveybutter: you on Maladath right now?
[8:24:41] soinks1992: to make an DK youÂ´ll need an lvl 55 char on that server
[8:25:00] Nico_vdM: Cauldron is in the basement of the inn
[8:25:02] bypized: @theoldgodmd Server and engine infrastructure
[8:25:06] Daveybutter: towelliee hit 55 already!?
[8:25:13] atowellthatiallreadyused: Unholy dk in pre patch and beta seems really polished
[8:25:14] willber125: what is retail mount
[8:25:15] xhale2nhale: honestly Blizzard can send everyone 1mil gold n there will be ppl who will find away to bitch about it
[8:25:17] zgag: With Pre-patch on the PTR it could be around a month for it to be released on live
[8:25:28] zgag: A possibility
[8:25:28] Daveybutter: weren't you like 35 yesterday? haha
[8:25:30] theoldgodmd: So then just download more RAM into the server
[8:25:32] Snabido: @Daveybutter He still in his 40's, relax Keepo
[8:25:35] SpoonManes: there jus be alot of players moe
[8:25:35] jeflag: @soinks1992 u dont need to. only in fresh server
[8:25:39] TomCat: it's not a hardware limitation - it's a design issue
[8:25:40] luckfore: jUsT aDd LaYeRs
[8:25:41] MMokuin: @Daveybutter one DK is free. no level req
[8:25:42] mozavich: thd is definitely wrong. classic players don't want cross realm gameplay. it's why we like classic and not playing retail.
[8:25:52] Arkitek: @Daveybutter hes on mankrik
[8:25:53] MikeyT93WoW: towilee is god
[8:26:01] Daveybutter: huh. how bout that.
[8:26:05] theoldgodmd: Silly blizzard doesn't know they can download ram
[8:26:05] Molvonos: @mozavich not all classic players want the same things.
[8:26:25] Nalleys: Noone in the classic community has ever asked for cross realm.     I dont play much Retail, but i know classic folk dont want t
[8:26:26] xhale2nhale: apparently he speaks for all Classic players
[8:26:35] SpoonManes: @mozavich how dare you i disagree *roar*
[8:26:36] losersreportedme: does towel have a guide on how to be as cool of a man as he is? id love to be atleast 50% cool as he is
[8:26:48] Stiffy84: towStop towIt
[8:26:54] amricatt: towStop towIt
[8:26:55] mozavich: @mozavich cross realm blows
[8:26:58] mikejames01: wrath is retail
[8:26:59] HaxzorJimDuggan: i care about people in my guild and my friends, everyone else in the community is meaningless to me
[8:27:07] mikejames01: wrath was rthe start
[8:27:08] mozavich: cross realm blows shit.
[8:27:09] mozavich: lmao
[8:27:11] guga_official: true
[8:27:12] Masqerader: gotta do the uncle joey when u  do "cut, it, out"
[8:27:15] atowellthatiallreadyused: everyone have flying anyway in WOTKL ppl fly past eachother anyway mightaswell implement mega server
[8:27:19] VUFFERDUFFER: Lmao you are so wrong its amazing.
[8:27:25] Gregadeaux: i'd like cata classic just because i never got to play it live :(
[8:27:25] bypized: MOP Classic
[8:27:30] mikejames01: and get over the ccross realm is shit cause its not
[8:27:31] TheCliffyShow: How rude!
[8:27:32] bypized: Wildstar Classic
[8:27:33] kerchuu: im just excited to relive expansions i didnt get to play
[8:27:33] losersreportedme: im a hot girl, hi chat
[8:27:39] untankful: WoD classic?
[8:27:48] mozavich: @mikejames01 except it is
[8:27:48] iiTornTunaii: cata raids too hard for classic andys
[8:27:50] bypized: Zovaal Classic
[8:27:51] atowellthatiallreadyused: but i like flying
[8:28:02] Mitune: I mean Wrath Babies was derogatory for a reason back then
[8:28:07] zodpwnbusiness: blizzard gms reporting banning everyone ruined wow
[8:28:09] Thoreya: ppl are wildin today
[8:28:10] zgag: I'm assuming the issue with the servers is due to the majority of the streamers are all on 1 server. Asmon/Esfand ect.
[8:28:10] HaxzorJimDuggan: oh i cant wait until LFD.... wait what
[8:28:19] mikejames01: @mikejames01 NO its not
[8:28:19] Inthezonewow: "I know we said Classic was peak WoW, but so was BC and Wrath" :)
[8:28:30] atowellthatiallreadyused: there are prose and cons with everything nothing can be 100% perfect
[8:28:30] zgag: All the viewers are on those servers
[8:28:32] losersreportedme: sir @Towelliee will they apply Dragonflying to other mounts later or whenever? id love to soar thru the skies with my Flying Machinees
[8:28:32] ThatW0lF: KILL ALL OF THE PEOPLE
[8:28:33] pavepawns: i still think classic as a whole was a mistake
[8:28:51] Arabus135: âGaspâ
[8:28:56] MOXP: dragonflight LUL
[8:29:13] K0rzak0v: what nameplates addon is this?
[8:29:22] mozavich: cross realm was a mistake. say what you want but that's depleted the community out of wow.
[8:29:30] Molvonos: 'Tregidy'
[8:29:30] 91Niki: @K0rzak0v Elvui
[8:29:38] atowellthatiallreadyused: there are prose and cons with everything nothing can be 100% perfect there are obviously some cons with flying and prose but in the end i love flying for what it is
[8:29:43] Daveybutter: Wrath best xpac ever
[8:29:44] Masqerader: didn't we have cross server dungeon finder in wrath ?
[8:29:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: we did
[8:30:02] EclipserEU: 3.3 ICC patch
[8:30:03] mozavich: @Masqerader yes, and you see it's not being implemented
[8:30:06] K0rzak0v: @K0rzak0v ah thanks. just elvui lol. never used them haha. always plater
[8:30:07] Arabus135: Just wait until cata classic :D
[8:30:07] Moobot: Towelliee will be playing WOTLK Classic on the Fresh server Maladath.
[8:30:10] xhale2nhale: how did crossrealm deplete the community, Jesus folks use anything to say it kills the community while the community still exist
[8:30:25] dreamwalker213: Is the mount reward retroactive if Iâve already leveled a dk in wrath or do I need to do it again?
[8:30:26] Psynarius: Do people want Cata classic?
[8:30:33] MoonwalkingAngel79: when dragon flight classic?
[8:30:39] mozavich: @xhale2nhale because you didn't know the people you were playing with in CRZ.
[8:30:54] HaxzorJimDuggan: its kills the community, meanwhile lets level with the same 5 people all the way to 80 avoiding the community
[8:30:58] Fruicer: @dreamwalker213 yea you can log in and get it
[8:31:05] Arabus135: Lol
[8:31:11] NBK_Sethus: lots of conveniences were fun when first introduced but have grown to undermine the game in the long run
[8:31:14] mozavich: idk, it's kind of cringe to be hating on people who don't like CRZ as a whole. that's why they play classic
[8:31:14] Gregadeaux: give me cata classic and just call it Cata Legacy or some shit
[8:31:16] dreamwalker213: @fruicer cool ty
[8:31:17] xhale2nhale: @mozavich I didn't knwo the folks I played with before Crossrealm only guildies
[8:31:26] Fruicer: @dreamwalker213 np
[8:31:31] mozavich: @xhale2nhale that's on you, bub.
[8:31:35] emznev: I do :)
[8:31:37] Drheer: how many time take to do the dk starting zone?
[8:31:37] atowellthatiallreadyused: The good things with flying is Farming , geting faster to destination get to raid entrance etc , the bad thing is the social aspect if stretching all the way back
[8:31:37] Gregadeaux: Those of us that didn't get to play it live do
[8:31:40] pavepawns: what killed ''community'' in wow is the community itself
[8:31:47] Nico_vdM: I hate this quest
[8:31:48] Plague_GG: Towelliee was like Dr Mann in Interstellar when he saw those new faces
[8:31:49] mozavich: @pavepawns and CRZ =p
[8:31:52] Gregadeaux: More people playing wow than those who started during van/tbc
[8:31:56] Mitune: Mop classic is probably the last big classic imo excluding legion memes
[8:31:57] TweektheProphet: I can't wait for Dragon flight classic
[8:31:58] xhale2nhale: @mozavich I'm fine with that
[8:32:03] pavepawns: @pavepawns no
[8:32:05] duffluv22: That mount!!!!!
[8:32:06] Masqerader: I want cata classic, just read an NPC say thralls balls
[8:32:14] Arabus135: Lmao
[8:32:15] AlphasaurusRexx: which servers are the fresh servers? skyfury and which one?
[8:32:15] xsp00n: if they just did cata PVP then id be happy
[8:32:18] DarkTerrorG: if i put dayton's on my 64 impala is it still a "classic"????? You betcha bottom it is
[8:32:27] cannibalcanyon: gotta beat it out of em lol
[8:32:43] mozavich: if you think blizzard isn't going to ride the money train that is classic gameplay, i got something to tell ya... :-) classic cata, classic mop, classic wod are all coming
[8:32:44] Drheer: how many time take to do the dk starting zone?
[8:32:45] Nico_vdM: Open the chest to get daggers. Then auto attack the daggers until you see an effect. Stop attacking. They either will give the info or not. Basically you are going to torture people
[8:32:56] PinksChicken: Sick crossover promo by blizz here ngl.
[8:33:03] 91Niki: @mozavich Classic WOD?! OMEGALUL
[8:33:11] Arabus135: Lmao
[8:33:15] Eggz1004: been killing mobs for the last 5-10 min trying to complete that next quest
[8:33:15] mozavich: :D
[8:33:19] 91Niki: My man said classic WOD
[8:33:19] atowellthatiallreadyused: Dragonriding is gonna be lit best improvment to flying ever gonna be hard to make something even better i think if they get it right
[8:33:21] Arabus135: Iâd play classic warlords
[8:33:22] MoonwalkingAngel79: i want thrall in fortnite
[8:33:23] 91Niki: Goodnight
[8:33:28] hammertofall: @Towelliee how long did it take you to recover from your chest surgery? had mine yesterday and im killing
[8:33:38] mozavich: @91Niki it's coming.
[8:33:38] MOXP: LEGION WHEN? :(
[8:33:42] mozavich: mark my words
[8:33:43] pavepawns: i mean atm the only reason to even touch classic is a mount for retail
[8:33:45] JFeezy__: i miss these types of talent trees. So fun dipping into different specs for talents
[8:33:50] Xara36: wont classic catch up to retail evnetually?
[8:33:52] Xara36: lol
[8:33:56] D3m0nHunt3r666: I wanna relive the classic experience of WoD Kappa
[8:34:01] mozavich: @Xara36 eventually, yep
[8:34:02] Arabus135: Warlords had the best questing to date
[8:34:07] 91Niki: Didn't they already say that wrath is the last classic in the lineup ?
[8:34:08] axoio: yes
[8:34:10] Nico_vdM: You have to auto attack
[8:34:12] Nico_vdM: Yes
[8:34:13] ThinkBucket: Do I need to make a ticket cause the option for DK in the class select isnt there?? Does chat know?
[8:34:17] mozavich: @91Niki nope, sure didn't
[8:34:18] Arabus135: Classic wod will be my make a wish
[8:34:32] axoio: worst quest in dk starting zone
[8:34:43] mozavich: @ThinkBucket if you have a dk on another server already, you have to have a level 55 on that server to make a new one
[8:34:49] emznev: CLASSIC legion <3
[8:34:59] Nico_vdM: Like a sound and a green cloud
[8:34:59] atowellthatiallreadyused: if they made a back of side azeroth expansion i think its not gonna be a continent its gonna be alot of smaller islands and you get boat as a mount xD or something pirate aarrrrhh
[8:35:10] fmpr79: itll stop attacking automatically
[8:35:16] MoonwalkingAngel79: reason i only had 1 dk is because i liked the beginning area but just for once
[8:35:28] dinomiyte: i still cant log into wrath, its telling me that i need an active subscription lol
[8:35:37] Arabus135: Lol
[8:35:42] ThinkBucket: @mozavich theres a blue post saying you dont even need 55 to make your 1st one, so im lost
[8:35:44] 91Niki: @dinomiyte That's because you do
[8:35:45] spookychefkarolina: @91niki no idea but given itâs proven lucrative for them, they may just go back in their words (if they said them) it wouldnât be the first time a company decides money is more important than what they said.
[8:35:54] TheCliffyShow: Have you tried asking nicely?
[8:36:01] Nico_vdM: That was quick. It usually took me like 5 to 10 minutes
[8:36:04] mozavich: @ThinkBucket for your first one, you don't.
[8:36:08] Snabido: Been like that since classic launched
[8:36:19] mozavich: more than one (multiple servers), you need a 55 for the second
[8:36:24] 91Niki: @spookychefkarolina Oh for sure. But I know they said Wrath was the last one planned. Obviously everyone can back up on their words.
[8:36:27] ThinkBucket: I have the client, I actively play retail, just installed WOTLK classic and the option for DK isnt there
[8:36:33] atowellthatiallreadyused: do people still play private im not that involved so im asking out of corousity
[8:36:34] WhatAboutBob71: so do they now have servers for each classic expansion level?
[8:36:35] dinomiyte: i do have an active subscription, im logged in now and i have had a subscription since day 1 @91Niki
[8:36:41] mozavich: @spookychefkarolina source?
[8:36:44] 91Niki: @dinomiyte Huh, odd
[8:36:48] Nico_vdM: If you chose a fresh server, you cannot make a dk
[8:36:54] Highparkk_: @ThinkBucket you need to install tbc and classic too i believe
[8:37:00] ThinkBucket: I tried Westfall after i tried maladeth @Towelliee
[8:37:03] 91Niki: @spookychefkarolina Mate just use google. Literally the first thing that pops up
[8:37:14] dinomiyte: yep i have the client
[8:37:25] saevenar: not our fault you slow ð
[8:37:31] xhale2nhale: I think you just need to install Wotlk Classic
[8:37:37] spookychefkarolina: @91niki true, weâll see DxCat
[8:37:38] Snabido: Ayo, your cousin is here too, Gimmemount
[8:37:43] TheCliffyShow: I didn't even choose a server. I just created a character on whatever server it put me on.
[8:37:47] MoonwalkingAngel79: your like halfway
[8:37:47] Nico_vdM: It can take a long time fighting other players for a respawn
[8:37:50] Lostdogal: I believe I said 'too long' lol
[8:37:50] PvtHudson093: you listened to chat again
[8:37:54] BlindsydeGaming: Well you arenât exactly doing the quests efficiently. They are decade old quests that have never been changed, even in retailâ¦ it really should only take you half an hour
[8:37:57] Eggz1004: you still need to do the event i think in EP at the end
[8:38:08] srze94: what do you think about Blood tank in WotLK?
[8:38:08] darkdestroz: DK begining is a good 1hr or 1hr 30min,
[8:38:18] Deepmoist247: why not skyfury?
[8:38:28] 91Niki: @spookychefkarolina I'm a cata baby. But I know you can't relive nostalgia. So I am all about new stuff :D
[8:38:29] Nico_vdM: You know that you are at the end if you get the Battle for Light's Hope
[8:38:30] CertifiableAndy: Still need a level 58 to make a DK right?
[8:38:33] mozavich: there's a lot of misinformation about DKs going around. hopefully, this clears it up. for your very FIRST DK, you do not need a level 55. For any other DKs, you need a 55. You cannot make a DK on a fresh server without having a 55 on that server.
[8:38:36] angrywowplayer1337: Irish gang rise up!! The Queen is gone and she got GGEzâd!!!! Time to party
[8:38:41] Highparkk_: @CertifiableAndy nope
[8:38:44] nostragen: can i get the mount IF i have 55lvl char on fresh server and make a DK?
[8:38:45] spookychefkarolina: @mozavich yo mama. Iâm joking. Iâve honestly have heard only good things money wise. Itâs never bad for a company as large as blizzard to have as much out as they can as long as itâs not completely and unapologetically tanking.
[8:38:50] Highparkk_: @angrywowplayer1337 super cringe dude
[8:38:59] jkitchin75: @angrywowplayer1337 get lost loser
[8:38:59] Mitune: yes
[8:39:03] darkdestroz: Yes
[8:39:07] Nico_vdM: You just missed him
[8:39:13] Mitune: just takes a while for him to spawn back
[8:39:16] Shorpa: upstairs towelliee
[8:39:17] angrywowplayer1337: @highparkk_ monarchies are cringe I agree .
[8:39:22] Nico_vdM: Its here and also upstairs
[8:39:30] Highparkk_: @angrywowplayer1337 nah you bringing that dumb shit to a wow stream is
[8:39:48] Holysal: @angrywowplayer1337 theres King Charles II now
[8:39:50] Nico_vdM: Its a defend quest
[8:39:51] mozavich: @spookychefkarolina "source?" was meant for the guy you replied to.
[8:39:52] Nico_vdM: Dont go
[8:39:54] sptheory: do we need to ding lvl 80 in wotlk as dk to get the mount? :D
[8:39:55] gold9871: nope down below
[8:39:57] axoio: stay down there
[8:40:05] 91Niki: @angrywowplayer1337 Stop
[8:40:10] Nico_vdM: @Towelliee that was a defend quest, go back
[8:40:16] spookychefkarolina: @mozavich oh. feelsstupidman LUL

[8:41:15] killercondon: Ok ty
[8:41:23] mozavich: @killercondon if you've already leveled it and completed the starting zone, just get your mount on retail. it should be there (mine was)
