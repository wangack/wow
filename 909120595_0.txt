[0:17:22] sir_vanillin: keep trying man CoolCat
[0:19:08] SlayerLightStorm: @sir_vanillin About all I can do until this is over. Either I get it before this event ends, or it's another year-long wait.
[0:24:50] SlayerLightStorm: Here's an idea: Over the course of the event every year, if accounts that don't have the Big Love Rocket attempt the dungeon fight and don't get it, on the next fight, and every one thereafter, those accounts get an increasing chance to obtain it, starting at the normal drop rate (0.03%) and capping at 3% (100x the normal rate)

[1:17:24] ghostofnappa_doom: wonder if they will d o what they did with GMOD and it will be off the boss at first and than changed to the final tier of the lfr wing after they realize no one stays for the rest of the lfr que
[1:17:32] Canadian_Geek: Aria stark
[1:17:33] MisterBongwater: maisie williams

[1:19:12] yunitoYuniro: They fix it a week later. Got the mount 3 months later xD
[1:19:34] ghostofnappa_doom: the raid tiers are suppose to be each of the covenant zones, so we got revendreth for first tier, and we know bastion will be last tier, do you think maldraxis or ardenwield will be our 2nd tier
[1:19:51] TheCliffyShow: I signed up for the waitlist for that.
[1:20:32] Nowyoulostme: I couldn't beat Twisting Corridors as my BM hunter, made a prot pally because I've watched you play one for years and beat layer 8 last night. Thanks a ton for the inspiration Towel!

[1:24:30] ghostofnappa_doom: well arbiter is suppose to be related to bastion and be the last tier "supposedly"
[1:24:33] TheUnknowing: i think that will be a part of the last raid of expac

[1:29:21] TheCliffyShow: When and where are we likely to fight Helya again?
[1:29:38] ghostofnappa_doom: yeah they had vanilla test servers up the moment it was announced at that blizzcon even tho it was only for an hour per toon
[1:30:56] ghostofnappa_doom: plus they dont have to rebuild everything from scratch since they already have servers and base line stuff for BC in the works so i want to believe it won't take as long to get BC going
[1:31:52] L4dy_Renegade: I wonder if we'll be whooping Sylvanas' ass in a raid.
[1:31:58] MOLAR305: need tanks?
[1:32:21] ghostofnappa_doom: whenever they saw the amount of people who played and the fact they had to increase server sizes and stuff and saw how much their sub count went up with vanilla they were like yeah we need bc
[1:32:31] ghostofnappa_doom: as im typing that you said that lol
[1:32:43] L4dy_Renegade: I swear if they do a redemption arch for her my eyes will roll so hard, they'd pop out of my skull and roll down the street.
[1:32:45] Masqerader: i mean the minute SL was released they were prepping the next expansion, how they work
[1:33:12] ghostofnappa_doom: i still have buddies who play classic, which tbh is weird to me, i did nax and than went to SL because vanilla wasn't my like biggest thing,BC ill prob no life pretty hard

[1:39:48] TheCliffyShow: The original concept was but they might not go with that.
[1:39:59] shutyourface: papa bless
[1:40:05] Ishva: damn
[1:40:20] TheCliffyShow: That Woody Harrelson movie was great.
[1:40:22] L4dy_Renegade: Did they ever touch base with the void shit, like really in depth with it?
[1:40:22] shutyourface: thanks larry for all that porn i found in the woods
[1:40:23] MOLAR305: glad I could help with the tanks ;)
[1:40:39] Masqerader: 78

[1:40:58] L4dy_Renegade: Oh yeah.
[1:41:03] bakurathewolf: Do you need to be 60 to get the mount?
[1:41:07] TheCliffyShow: I gurantee Dragon Isles will be the next expansion or 11.0 at the latest.
[1:41:08] shutyourface: 50
[1:41:32] Masqerader: I wonder if lvls are gonna increase by 10 next expansion or they gonna do it by 5

[1:42:23] TheCliffyShow: Now, kids have Pornhub.
[1:42:56] MOLAR305: they don't know what's its like to watch blurry playboy channel and hope to see a boob
[1:43:16] ghostofnappa_doom: Wonder if with patch 9.0.5 they are going to make legion content legacy so it's soloable. i think this is the longest 2 expansion old content has remained unsoloable (raid wise)
[1:43:51] L4dy_Renegade: Haha scrambled PPV porn movies. I remember those days.
[1:44:05] MOLAR305: fuck that's right
[1:44:08] shutyourface: up that contrast baby
[1:44:12] Ishva: lol spice haha loved that channel
[1:44:13] shutyourface: i see a booooob
[1:44:15] talic420: lol AOL 10min to download a pic
[1:44:25] Masqerader: i remember sneaking down stairs middle of the night to watch Night Calls at like 15
[1:44:27] nihilistic_bat: spice, I havent seen that many pixels since tube tv's
[1:44:34] Solid0Liquid: @Towelliee remember Spice at Nite?
[1:44:39] TheCliffyShow: Now all you gotta do is input whatever weird fetish you have into Google and boom! There goes your afternoon.
[1:44:50] shutyourface: its already supposed to be legacy, damage is borked
[1:44:59] Masqerader: not yet
[1:45:26] Masqerader: they need to fix mechanics too like aggramar, soul hunter, eonar and KJ(mythic)
[1:45:33] ghostofnappa_doom: i have a shackled urzul im refusing to farm until it is legacy
[1:45:33] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[1:45:44] Masqerader: and mythic gul'dan
[1:46:00] ghostofnappa_doom: well i have all infernals and i have all the bfa mounts, i just didn't do argus and it haunts me
[1:46:01] herpderpdoublederp: all the vengeance dhs going to reroll to mecrolord
[1:46:04] shutyourface: i can solo up to nighthold
[1:46:06] herpderpdoublederp: nectrolord
[1:46:19] TheCliffyShow: I did Mythic Nighthold with like 4 people.
[1:46:43] shutyourface: this is the one man
[1:46:44] ghostofnappa_doom: and in 700 argus runs ive seen 3 shackled urzuls drop to others. it's too disheartening to be running 1 in 100 raid lockout chance and than 1 in 20 chance if its looted to me.
[1:46:46] shutyourface: i can feel it
[1:46:54] Masqerader: it will get castrated
[1:47:54] Aidler: you should be able to do it solo. that's the whole point
[1:47:59] Masqerader: I can solo it all but mythic Gul'Dan
[1:48:16] ghostofnappa_doom: yeah mythic content you should always solo because it isn't personal loot it's raid lockout . so each person you take for a mythic mount chance is taking away from your chance of it being looted to you
[1:48:32] Lhuvbug: Finally got the loverocket my dude!
[1:48:52] Ishva: damn keeps going down
[1:48:55] Aidler: I can't get past mythic spellblade...
[1:49:03] Masqerader: random heroic dungeon cache is up, so tempted to farm runes
[1:49:09] Ishva: im guessing it jumps up around blizcon
[1:49:16] Ishva: blizcon
[1:49:39] ghostofnappa_doom: have you done tyrannical since they nerfed it from 40% to 30%? i haven't ran it yet
[1:50:04] Garrujak: for a noob scrub, what would be a better tank for learning M+ and raiding, Pally or Monk?
[1:50:22] ghostofnappa_doom: 10% overall health on say a 16 key which is 196% scaling. so when it's scaled super high that 10% might cut off 15-20 seconds off the fight
[1:50:23] Masqerader: it should have been like 20%
[1:51:25] Masqerader: @ghostofnappa_doom its still overkill on certain encounters, like Hakkar
[1:52:45] Ishva: oh yeah loved that view
[1:52:48] cruzeal: looks purty
[1:52:53] frosty48: legion :(
[1:52:57] Masqerader: trae young
[1:53:01] cruzeal: ikr frosty :(
[1:53:14] ghostofnappa_doom: i wonder if they have fixed the bug on Final boss of De Other Side where that boss doesn't apply to a monks stagger so they've been taking full damage the whole time
