[1:13:01] donkeebrainz: there are tons of studies showing why its bad for you
[1:13:05] Genghish: Porn drains your mana... You need mana to be powerful
[1:13:07] coolcrazyguy72: I think it’s the way it’s used. hamburgers are great if your not fat and eating 12

[1:13:55] Skriz: once I run out of tinder swipes I goto xhamster
[1:13:56] windatar: Healthy relationships went the way of the dodo when social media was picked up. Porn is about as harmful as violent video games. Lol

[1:15:21] SynthAttackTM: @StaysafeTV if its a problem to u u can just stop watching it, but why should it be for everyone?
[1:15:22] mario32: @dreadd39 i rea dan articl ewhere this streamer makes 2mil per month while watching her sleep on stream
[1:15:32] Milanesa_De_Pollo: The problem is that when we identify the problem and who's causing it, we get cancelled, fired, or put in jail
[1:15:50] linkitcraig: its life advice
[1:15:50] Bronloch: NOPE its the birth control pills

[1:16:04] j011yj0e230: yes
[1:16:05] chatgpttwitchbot: if they want to then yea
[1:16:06] dreadd39: @Milanesa_De_Pollo 👃 them
[1:16:07] windatar: We've had porn and the adult industry since the dawn of time. But the problems we have now all of sudden means its bad? Then why are those problems happening now then? Porn was here before and porn is here now.

[1:17:19] sarahuckabee: @SynthAttackTM a fuck ton of people
[1:17:24] crenger: hey man, dosent freakin bother me dude
[1:17:30] chatgpttwitchbot: @StaysafeTV  but you are a degenerate you play WoW all day
[1:17:35] NotTheWheel: porn is just another vice that erodes society
[1:17:38] icylemons1993: I like that take
[1:17:42] dave3ooo: watching porn isn't the same thing as having a porn addiction though. any addiction is a problem.
[1:17:42] SynthAttackTM: @sarahuckabee well there are ppl addicted to sugar.. come on
[1:17:43] BEASTM0DE514: theres 0 benefit to porn
[1:17:44] Brewsy_: You don't want a utopia like that, then who would you put down to make yourself feel and look better?
[1:17:49] icylemons1993: Its a quality take
[1:17:50] SaucyRMD: Porn might lower the chances of sexual assault
[1:17:52] T_Bag93x: the porn addiction is as crippling as the drug addiction
[1:17:53] TV_Spider: @StaysafeTV dont you think the same arguements can be used against streamers? IE people watch way to much streamers and it hurt society.
[1:17:56] Voidbonx: unethical :O
[1:17:56] XarcTV: @windatar sure i can agree with that
[1:17:58] NotTheWheel: It only works to an extent

[1:18:21] XarcTV: WTS is trade
[1:18:22] iscamog: trade
[1:18:39] Br0connell: we should prob ban videogames too then, because its addiction that's the prob and people are losing their life's and not maximizing their potential by getting lost in them.
[1:18:40] NotTheWheel: Yes and Staysafe has said as much if you need to improve your life you shouldn't be gaming or watching streams.
[1:18:41] therealrickdiculous: lost my first decent hc character to clicking the wrong flight master
[1:18:44] icylemons1993: LUL

[1:18:52] imforthcoming: twitch is a net negative for society, everyone here isn’t productive or improving society… so we should ban streaming right
[1:19:04] inspiredtv: try haggling him to 2g once you get there @StaysafeTV
[1:19:08] FroztyIV: I'm reading social academic @ uni, you're 100 % correct.

[1:46:06] endraga1: Bedge
[1:46:06] tsetse2fly: zzzzzzz rested xp
[1:46:10] feelinchrisp: i always knew the horde was soft
[1:46:11] Plathyy: @Plathyy depends on the requirements
[1:46:13] feelinchrisp: cuddling before their raid
[1:46:14] XarcTV: ResidentSleeper
[1:46:15] EffinsTV: I know about that, it's a recurring phenomenon in EU, or it's been in the last decade at least, but things need to be defined specifically maybe. 'Not citizen' is a broad spectrum.
[1:46:19] yuckil: BASEDHALT i dont wish to be horny anymore
[1:46:19] Mungtime: jk, unles?
[1:46:27] icylemons1993: even if they do win they cant anyway
[1:46:41] abruptdecayO_O: ofc
[1:46:48] inspiredtv: @Plathyy Ah I see, is it like most of the refugees arent really seeking that outcome and are just residing still
[1:46:52] Humansoup: C-Ya
[1:46:56] icylemons1993: Yeah illegally , thats one thing
[1:47:02] windatar: The whole deportation thing will get a lot more headlines when the mega droughts start happening. Pretty sure thats what jump started the Syrian civil war with farmers being unable to make food.
[1:47:04] Zevioi: Just saw a staff of jordan
[1:47:13] conspiraciesgamer: anchor children should not be a thing
[1:47:17] solkte: That is insane, 2nd gen immigrants know no other country, home and even language
[1:47:21] icylemons1993: leagal citizens wont be touched , believe me
[1:47:22] Carlt4pult: not illigaly. they have citizenship @staysave
[1:47:37] ainoi: the problem is this immigrants get 10 kids and now their all allowed in a differently culture and destroy it....
[1:47:37] Plathyy: @inspiredtv denmark did it right, you can look into that. they had rules for learning the danish language and integrate, turns out 90% of refugees had to leave because they had no interest in that
[1:47:38] robbiestacks: it becomes a “humanitarian” issue
[1:47:39] icylemons1993: The majority of the german people wont allow it
[1:47:39] windatar: Birth tourism
[1:47:42] Humansoup: Welcome ... Come on in.. Here is half my check
[1:47:42] hoodcraft: its called anchor babies
[1:47:50] jonisyntinen: Whats the benefit of boing bfd anymore? @staysafetv
[1:47:52] snoymonkey: what happens when the child grows up and moves out?
[1:47:58] conspiraciesgamer: incentivize the invading population to have kids in your country... how smart are we
[1:48:01] feelinchrisp: @jonisyntinen you get xp
[1:48:04] Bronloch: LUL Chinese pregnant ladies walking around LA non stop LUL
[1:48:04] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: assimilation is the key, it really should be common decency to respect the country that takes you in, and respect their culture and valves... sure keep your own, but don't run amok and create headaches for the locals
[1:48:12] CrippinLimpin: Vivek was right on ending birthright citizenship
[1:48:19] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: values*
[1:48:23] inspiredtv: @Plathyy Ahh I see yeah that would make sense, if the people dont want to adhere to the standards than yeah get them out, I would assume thats whats happening with germany?
[1:48:32] EffinsTV: @icylemons1993 you can gain citizenship if you are born in that country or you have been in the country for a certain amount of time and apply for citizenship.
[1:48:35] Farenheight451: Im sick of these homeless bums in sleeping bags around stormwind and beautiful iron forge. get the out
[1:48:37] donkeebrainz: hes talking about the parents of anchor babies
[1:48:40] Plathyy: @Plathyy not if the left wing parties stay in control
[1:48:40] donkeebrainz: do they still get to stay
[1:48:45] jonisyntinen: @feelinchrisp Does it scale lvl by lvl?
[1:48:46] S_Aljallaf: HI GAYMERS! GOOD MORNING
[1:48:57] bazzzgg: the replacement theory (as in voters) seems to be the only logical explanation for the U.S border and biden just ignoring it
[1:49:03] yuckil: ur so buff Flushed
[1:49:22] tbatch1: the answer is to end lobbying and then establish term limits for congress if there is a deficit… then they wouldn’t allow immigration at all especially the illegal
[1:49:25] robbiestacks: @bazzzgg explain
[1:49:27] srkosu: xdd
[1:49:30] korleonexx: as yuropoor and read on the american dystopia i cant imagine why people would go to such lengths to immigrate to united states
[1:49:34] corsair714: @bazzzgg its evident at this point
[1:49:38] icylemons1993: @icylemons1993 Yes , and those people will stay citizens
[1:49:45] Pimplejewce: @bazzzgg i think it has more to do with special interests wanting cheap labour
[1:49:49] abruptdecayO_O: @korleonexx because america is the greatest country on earth
[1:49:53] abruptdecayO_O: no cap
[1:49:55] bazzzgg: @robbiestacks illegal immigrants can vote in local elections already
[1:50:02] EffinsTV: The entire refugee thing blew out of proportion because it was not done properly and the refugee communities not regulated and controlled properly.
[1:50:18] inspiredtv: @Plathyy I see, I understand the frustrations now, seems like people are taking advantage of their stay
[1:50:18] korleonexx: @abruptdecayO_O only if you are rich
[1:50:29] robbiestacks: @bazzzgg oh yea flooring them in to vote for Biden ?
[1:50:33] Genghish: Palestine
[1:50:42] jonisyntinen: Another WEF puppet president installed in Finland… @staysafetv
[1:50:48] icylemons1993: well you are german , or swedish if u have citizenship
[1:50:49] Wingsofjanitor: what is a Swede? PauseChamp
[1:50:52] F0ambeard: Racist om
[1:50:55] bazzzgg: @robbiestacks exactly, or any candidate in the future
[1:50:55] icylemons1993: even if your not a native person
[1:50:59] Brenno_Mc: Native Americans?
[1:51:06] morti_garcia: bro change your stream title
[1:51:09] MisterBumps: what about the other Japanese on the island they brutalized
[1:51:16] Carlt4pult: so that means that americans should exclude irish that imigrated ling time ago? @StaysafeTV
[1:51:17] EffinsTV: @Brenno_Mc XDD
[1:51:21] bigsugg11: how about polish?
[1:51:22] colt_1888: @StaysafeTV what's your /played on your lock?
[1:51:27] Voidbonx: no
[1:51:28] morti_garcia: cool!
[1:51:33] icylemons1993: I mean native or not it doesnt matter in this world , citizenship on paper is just as valuable
[1:51:39] trailerparkkgamer: america is first and foremost for the native americans
[1:51:41] linkitcraig: Israel is for the Israelites YEP
[1:51:44] Metaphix: seems like to lefties sometimes everyone is indigenous except white people, like they came in space ships or something
[1:51:47] originmorii: reltuc POGGERS
[1:51:48] SelmacTV: But as a German you not alowed to say it ... I am 50. have no problem with our guest but i will be called nazi if i say this
[1:51:55] windatar: Biggest problem facing western countries is they're birthrate has fallen below replacing the elderly, so they fall on illegal and legal immigration to grow the population since most people arent having kids anymore.
[1:52:03] QuestFor420: yep
[1:52:05] yuckil: @linkitcraig and the uk is for the russians
[1:52:08] Pimplejewce: Seems like a lot of western countries elites have fully embraced a global perspective and are now not necessarily placing the success of their own countrymen first.(maybe they almost never did)
[1:52:15] spike82q: dont eel your shit for fire water adn shiny shit
[1:52:15] QuestFor420: they didnt protect shit lol
[1:52:22] Bronloch: YOU CANT TAKE LAND AWAY FROM PEOPLE IN THE STONE AGE
[1:52:24] tbatch1: bro native Americans were dog shit fighters
[1:52:25] conspiraciesgamer: native americans had open borders lol
[1:52:29] tbatch1: they kost
[1:52:30] tbatch1: lost
[1:52:30] hoodcraft: anthrax pillows
[1:52:34] tbatch1: get over it
[1:52:37] Labrinthgg: @conspiraciesgamer exactly LOL
[1:52:46] TV_Spider: What they have casinos now.
[1:52:48] EffinsTV: @tbatch1 only cuz they did not have fire weapons?
[1:53:09] icylemons1993: they are smoking mushrooms and collecting welfare checks
[1:53:18] Pimplejewce: lebensraum 1.0
[1:53:18] conspiraciesgamer: they outnumbered the invaders 10 to 1 could have easily overwhelmed them firearms or not
[1:53:23] Tobssessxic: @icylemons1993 KEKW
[1:53:27] hoodcraft: bobby baccala
[1:53:29] spike82q: conquers through the pen and treatys that werent "upheld"
[1:53:29] Labrinthgg: Native Americans alive today in the USA, have it so rough, given casinos, monthly paychecks from tax payers... so rough...
[1:53:29] lightkekerino: you white people can stay its okay
[1:53:30] tbatch1: bro most civilizations that do human sacrifice go to the shitter
[1:53:39] Bronloch: ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF MOST WARS IN ALL OF HISTORY
[1:53:44] Tobssessxic: @Jollyrogger monkaW
[1:53:50] abruptdecayO_O: @Jollyrogger yeah i usually take dn
[1:53:54] bigsugg11: how about aliens come and take over the world. what then @StaySafe?
[1:54:02] RealMargiela: @Jollyrogger Sleeping pills & alcohol
[1:54:03] inspiredtv: I guess I just dont understand giant "mob mentality" I wish it was easier said than done but if everyone could just have a piece of land that they had to farm and live on to survive    and realize we are all human and interconnected, war sucks and it absolutely should not be happening worldwide
[1:54:05] tsetse2fly: will you ever get wildgrowth?
[1:54:07] bazzzgg: @Jollyrogger HAHAHAHAHAHA KEKW
[1:54:12] Wingsofjanitor: aliens out Madge
[1:54:14] dave3ooo: no countries are interested in invalidating germany's sovereignty or have imperialistic notions toward germany tho
[1:54:17] EffinsTV: why?
[1:54:18] copy_pastas: too late
[1:54:20] NaManDatAintMe: why not
[1:54:21] yuckil: that would be cool
[1:54:22] donkeebrainz: bigot
[1:54:23] NaManDatAintMe: it could be fun
[1:54:23] yuckil: tho
[1:54:25] copy_pastas: biden let them in already
[1:54:26] Metaphix: illegal aliens
[1:54:39] NaManDatAintMe: you dont want to mount a resistance to the aliens?
[1:54:40] Maxifrog: you cool with them just watching tho?
[1:54:52] Probulator: I doubt aliens could get pass the amount of trash we left in our orbit
[1:54:58] robbiestacks: @jollyrogger I got you
[1:55:04] Pimplejewce: @inspiredtv unfortunately the individual will always be vulnerable to the collective, so better to team up with like minded folks to create a walled garden
[1:55:15] yoitshesi: chat always with the very interesting political topics lol
[1:55:22] schyrro: @Jollyrogger Magnesium helps with the tight jaw and muscle aches. Constantly drinking water or chewing gum helps with saliva production to make your gums and mouth less dry. Stop abusing stimulants, if it's causing you to sleep less and all of these severe symptoms, you need to quit and find another medication/hobby substance
[1:55:25] bennybe: ur kinda Gatekeeping earth atm, a bit nazi of u
[1:55:28] RiverK1ngPoker: mass immigration is a great way to break a country apart or break it down
[1:55:30] korleonexx: I have nothing against the aliens I just dont want them here
[1:55:30] NaManDatAintMe: dysons are vacuums dude
[1:55:32] EffinsTV: @StaysafeTV would you agree if aliens came by peacefully and requested to become US citizens?
[1:55:38] inspiredtv: @Pimplejewce I just want my own garden with my neighbors around me to break bread with, why does it have to be so complicated
[1:55:40] photek_tn: wouldnt be a classic raid if you didnt have gear broken, or almost broken.
[1:55:45] MisterBumps: what if the aliens come from below
[1:55:48] windatar: This is about to go sideways
[1:55:48] Brenno_Mc: are you a Peter F Hamilton fan?
[1:56:01] bennybe: stop gatekeeping earth
[1:56:02] Bronloch: what runes?
[1:56:03] robbiestacks: @schyrro what a whole hearted reply
[1:56:04] bazzzgg: just offer them a Mak'gora with fists, you ever seen those scrawny little bitches? aliens are pussies 100%
[1:56:09] lightkekerino: they need to go back to their own god damn solar system
[1:56:10] Maxifrog: get flushed

[1:58:46] Pimplejewce: @inspiredtv oh I agree completely. Currency enables a "middleman" into every single action in one's lives.
[1:58:47] inspiredtv: @XarcTV Id much rather trade my garden with my family than obsess over how much money one another has its just so fucking silly

[2:03:00] swagrlicious: When MC gear will be a downgrade to level 50 raid set :D
[2:03:07] pizzadad212: level 50 raid gonna be better than MC easily
[2:03:09] theradoor: I havnt replaced anything from BFD (bis) yet and im 37 xD
[2:03:19] The_RightTwix: I think its likely that MC gear gets changed and upgraded
[2:03:28] bRokaLee: bRokaLee subscribed with Prime. 
[2:03:32] windatar: Think thats why they started changing old gear.
[2:03:37] Cileth: full 25 bis warrior...level 38 right now. I got 6.5% crit
[2:03:38] iBanEvader: tbh we would all be fine with just the runes
[2:03:44] iBanEvader: the gear doesn't really matter
[2:03:48] Farenheight451: i feel like this phase also needs to be way shorter because there is less to do at 40
[2:03:54] Boosticuff: the MC changes would go so well with SOD
[2:04:21] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV are you going to play lvl 60 raids if they stay 40man?
[2:04:36] RiverK1ngPoker: I’m not trying to be negative but I feel like I’m just playing classic all over again.
[2:04:58] iBanEvader: lmao
[2:05:06] smurfberriess: AQ still my favorite raid
[2:05:14] iBanEvader: i went to stv with the zeppelin and when I arrived all hell broke loose on the boat
[2:05:15] Infractus1: that would suck
[2:05:19] 0sikS: maybe 20
[2:05:24] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV i'll do 20man but not 40
[2:05:26] thesamman23: i think they might have taken a bit too long to bring this new phase out

[2:05:33] saronitebomb: Mkae MC 80 man

[2:05:36] chilemangx: 20 man woulda been cool
[2:05:36] Maxifrog: I think we need to introduce 60 man raids

[2:05:55] BlindOwlInTree: just run it as 10 men they dont have to change anything you will have soo much power it will be even easier
[2:05:58] px_aaron32: 15 min
[2:06:07] badnews09: that was classic, we need to discover how 40 man raids are
[2:06:09] Jubnar: 25 mans would be sick
[2:06:16] SaucyRMD: No one wants 40 man raid/loot drama while leveling
[2:06:18] The_RightTwix: I believe they said it had to do with dungeon sizes. They aren't creating new ones, so you need to fit in existing dungeons
[2:06:24] originmorii: can you explain why you want 20 over 10? @StaysafeTV
[2:06:41] Bronloch: 5 / 10 /40
[2:07:00] kyidentity: BASED
[2:07:17] windatar: 10 man feels like the sweet spot for finding enough people. Finding 20 people when it isn't current content might be hard for pugs.
[2:07:38] Metaphix: imagine all the guild drama that caused
[2:07:44] kyidentity: Kara + 25 mans
[2:07:49] kyidentity: great idea
[2:07:58] icylemons1993: <3 <3 <3
[2:08:05] dytallix87: its crazy to think that there were 40 man raids back when dsl internet was a thing
[2:08:08] markja629: a lot of us don't really have time to make a 40 man raid every 3 days
[2:08:12] dytallix87: shit was so laggy

[2:09:02] Hawkeyes31: Nickelodeon broadcast was fabulous
[2:09:03] Voidbonx: overtime to squeeze in more ads
[2:09:06] Bronloch: perfectly scripted for max drama LUL  like WWE
[2:09:11] pizzadad212: it was suspenseful, but idk about a good game. 9ers fan so biased lol
[2:09:13] bazzzgg: i think its hilarious that the players that win the super bowl get dubbed world champions KEKW
[2:09:24] SneakyChalupa: soccer and baseball fans were appalled by how exciting it was.
[2:09:24] Humansoup: T Swift Made a TD in OT
[2:09:28] Humansoup: LOL
[2:09:28] XarcTV: not seahawks?
[2:09:29] Voidbonx: KKona
[2:09:30] Bronloch: LUL
[2:09:30] clay024: No football? Are you a communist?
[2:09:33] dytallix87: i remember playing WoW back in 2005 and the lag spikes were the hardest part about raiding
[2:09:33] haodab: it was a diverse and family friendly show with lots of positivity for each individual pogchamp !
[2:09:35] pizzadad212: Gayge
[2:09:35] sethret: Noooooooooo
[2:09:44] tuggiesFTW: Two record breaking distance kicks for field goals was cool
[2:09:44] SneakyChalupa: MMA is the only good sport, it's that simple.
[2:09:48] Bronloch: Cowboys havent done shit since the 1990s LUL
[2:09:52] ShockWeasel: @SneakyChalupa football is equally boring just more loud

[2:10:14] Humansoup: lol
[2:10:16] standarddefinitionhd: patriots tho
[2:10:17] Pimplejewce: Greenbay lets go
[2:10:21] SneakyChalupa: @ShockWeasel throwing balls around is lame when you could be watching boxing or mma instead. Actually hard sports.
[2:10:25] Scaleless1776: kinda hard to believe Esfand quit wow
[2:10:26] Humansoup: CowGrils
[2:10:35] Humansoup: Girls *
[2:10:47] bazzzgg: @SneakyChalupa tyson fury is going to cave usyks face in
[2:10:48] ShockWeasel: @SneakyChalupa mma is also boring
[2:10:57] NotDessx: Overspending with no results. Yep americas team lmao
[2:10:59] SneakyChalupa: @ShockWeasel it's ok to have low T
[2:11:00] diarrerik: thanks for attacking the totem
[2:11:06] Bronloch: "In the coming months the system will start to back away from the  .... " LUL
[2:11:21] Wingsofjanitor: Gayge
[2:11:25] glenncloseisaman: Did you know "swifty" used to be a derogatory term meaning someone who is dim-witted
[2:11:34] glenncloseisaman: part of the humiliation ritual
[2:11:34] ShockWeasel: @SneakyChalupa fighting with that many rules is boring to watch. Sorry you take other people doing things personally
[2:11:37] Humansoup: Bare Knuckle Fighting ,, Now Thats Crazy Stuff
[2:11:40] sweetleaf_: i think with mma its more about the sport itself
[2:11:46] diarrerik: you can enjoy the sport without having "a guy"
[2:11:47] SneakyChalupa: You literally nailed it lmao. And you only get to watch ur favorite fighter 2-3 times per year @StaysafeTV
[2:11:49] cyonara74: @StaysafeTV American Football is better than Soccer (thats right, i said it.  SOCCER)
[2:11:50] robbiestacks: lol interesting take…
[2:11:51] dytallix87: bare knuckle boxing is better than the UFC. grappling is boring.
[2:11:52] lafaylafay: 0 sense was made
[2:11:57] deadvesu: yeah you can enjoy fights between different style fighters
[2:11:59] clay024: It is about the fight itself. the matchup. not a fighter per se.
[2:12:00] pizzadad212: tennis is like that
[2:12:01] icylemons1993: i mean u can have a favorite guy ,but if ur a true fan u enjoy all the fights
[2:12:01] AxelFromAustralia: Charles Olivera Illumnated by god let’s get this belt back king
[2:12:04] badnews09: you'd have to be a fan of a weight class
[2:12:09] Bronloch: its more about who is rising and how far the climb and who is falling and how far
[2:12:12] originmorii: mma and tennis are 2 where i feel like rooting for multiple people is nomal
[2:12:19] Bronloch: for me MMA is that way
[2:12:24] bazzzgg: It's just appreciating people that are great at their craft. Take Tyson Fury in boxing, hes an incredible entertainer too
[2:12:36] TheEndIsNear777: grappling is a big part of fighting, it's not boring just because no "violence" lol
[2:12:45] icylemons1993: i used to watch mma , i respected every guy that stepped into that ring
[2:12:51] TheEndIsNear777: although i wouldnt' watch a full grappling event XD, just MMA

[2:38:52] KKonaStevieG: Dev fetish's exposed
[2:38:58] Solkos: @StaysafeTV dance with the wicked is bugged in an extremely good way for us btw
[2:39:03] bubbaluff: Show feet frontal
[2:39:06] NotTheWheel: oh that's a bit scuffed
[2:39:15] Herathas: 30 %
[2:39:15] TheEndIsNear777: machine handled instead of manhandled xd
[2:39:22] Solkos: @StaysafeTV in a way that gives us infinite mana
[2:39:22] fukus0da: no
[2:39:24] fukus0da: u cant
[2:39:24] moovment2534: no
[2:39:30] Jillytv: devastate got kinda nerfed so warrs were theory crafting DW fury, i tried that. went fine we only wiped once all raid but felt too squish atm @fukus0da

[2:39:59] RudyRube: 50% of rogues dmg rn is poison lmao
[2:40:09] jgrad_: 30% on crowd pummel not 25%
[2:40:48] juicedawg: so nature protection potion seem to be the new shadow protection potion?
[2:41:12] juicedawg: they will probably go significantly up in price
[2:41:18] SneakyChalupa: Looking forward to phase 4 Naxx being easy compared to the new raid. Curious what the autistic old-heads have to say about that, while crying that blizz shouldn't add QoL updates like instant mail. There's no argument
[2:41:32] fukus0da: @juicedawg ye its not 100% needed tho..
[2:41:36] Dmaceee: @StaysafeTV you dont have to have 2 groups of 3 players, just 2 players to bait the charges
[2:41:42] romierome31: @SneakyChalupa well this is retail so i doubt they care
[2:41:51] maannyy_x: yer
[2:41:51] Drezfate: yes

[2:41:54] Drezfate: its epic
[2:41:54] OGSceneBoy: Ehhhh I dont like it
[2:41:54] romierome31: my guild said it was fun
[2:41:54] jbarish: no
[2:41:55] sweatlordkush: no
[2:41:55] WTFitsTaylor: looks to be
[2:41:55] SneakyChalupa: @romierome31 It's not tho..? They constantly cry
[2:41:55] MajurDJ: i love it
[2:41:56] PippTheKid: this fight is rly fun
[2:41:56] terobot78: yeweee
[2:41:57] Ahoqx: better than bfd
[2:41:58] dispensaryttv: Yes
[2:41:58] KeidooTV: epic
[2:41:58] jbarish: too hard for classic andys
[2:41:59] Dmaceee: @Staysafe 4, 5 , 6 is sweet
[2:42:00] ougopow: I hate gnomer...
[2:42:04] dispensaryttv: better than bfd
[2:42:09] romierome31: @SneakyChalupa its new content. how is it not?
[2:42:11] sweatlordkush: its like a retail raid
[2:42:13] TheEndIsNear777: @SneakyChalupa dude everything is boring and not fun Geez
[2:42:13] mrmangasm: yeah agree
[2:42:21] DeathLyst: all SoD raids are lazy, need new areas not resused assests
[2:42:23] clay024: I liked the Murloc one
[2:42:25] mrmangasm: baron and murloc were not fun
[2:42:25] NotTheWheel: seems like a lot of just pay attention and dodge
[2:42:27] windatar: You'll hate the last boss then.
[2:42:28] Mawshaw: I DON'T WANT TO STOP DAMAGE Madge
[2:42:29] Dagorine: murloc room ceiling way too low
[2:42:33] SneakyChalupa: @TheEndIsNear777 not sure what you mean lol
[2:42:43] deathlokk97: Ayo, off topic, but lemme tell you this bloodmoon event and the gy campers after it ends is why i dont play games like this anymore lmao
[2:42:50] TheEndIsNear777: @SneakyChalupa i'm saying you find everything "boring" and "not fun" XD
[2:42:57] Bronloch: HOLD W ONLY GAS GAS GAS
[2:43:00] mrmangasm: @Dagorine yes and baron should have been placed in the middle of the platform
[2:43:08] SneakyChalupa: @TheEndIsNear777 oh, my bad bro. Learn how to read then.
[2:43:19] dispensaryttv: this fight kinda  a dps check
[2:43:22] PippTheKid: when the sheep gets near the others it also does aoe reflect dmg
[2:43:32] sweatlordkush: too many mechanics for dad gamers
[2:43:34] TheEndIsNear777: @SneakyChalupa Sigh
[2:43:42] fukus0da: @PippTheKid no that is a cast.
[2:43:45] KKonaStevieG: KEKW 8 pages of notes
[2:43:48] PippTheKid: oh rly
[2:43:50] mrmangasm: I have a feeling pugs will struggle
[2:43:59] PippTheKid: always seemed to reflect when it got near the other mechanics
[2:44:04] sweatlordkush: @mrmangasm 90% of players will not clear gnomer
[2:44:08] MajurDJ: that frontal targets random player so everyone needs to keep an eye on it
[2:44:13] Nomiek: Can you post those notes in classic-wow channel on disc after? PauseChamp
[2:44:26] PippTheKid: thats what we did
[2:44:28] fukus0da: @PippTheKid nah its just a cast then it gains reflect for like 20 sec
[2:44:28] SneakyChalupa: @TheEndIsNear777 Not sure what you're sighing at. I'm makin fun of the people who hold SoD back, and it's the classic WoW crowd.
[2:44:32] dispensaryttv: we used a hunter
[2:44:34] hoorayhang: Yes
[2:44:38] shalomski: Cant kite it
[2:44:41] Kat__loaf: did we beat wow yet?
[2:44:43] dispensaryttv: or lock
[2:44:44] PippTheKid: it walks around randomly
[2:44:45] ShingaTV: no because the sheep is running random around
[2:44:46] Mahca_: sheep just walks around really
[2:44:55] Dagorine: put shaman threat buff on a mage
[2:44:55] PippTheKid: but we had casters focus it
[2:44:56] ZinoLIVE: ele sham
[2:45:01] shalomski: It has no threat table, will just wonder
[2:45:07] EffinsTV: Man, the cadence of Sarthe is so annoying :D :D :D
[2:45:08] PippTheKid: yep
[2:45:08] Drezfate: correect
[2:45:09] Prohx: correct
[2:45:09] Mahca_: it just wanders
[2:45:13] ShingaTV: yep
[2:45:14] KKonaStevieG: Like the lava ball
[2:45:18] poorboy55: it follows the other adds i think
[2:45:32] Drivebypwned: the last boss is really the hardest boss in the raid lol
[2:45:39] Drivebypwned: all of them together
[2:45:43] Mahca_: last boss is a doozy
[2:45:53] fukus0da: 4 phase in sod BatChest
[2:46:18] sweatlordkush: and ppl thought BFD was hard
[2:46:20] Kat__loaf: does the button still hurt you monkaS
[2:46:21] fukus0da: ranged kill bombs (PRIO)
[2:46:34] clay024: Looks like Mario 64 bombs
[2:46:47] Mahca_: bombs have like 200 hp, just one shot them on boomy
[2:46:56] hoorayhang: Bad guilds are so gonna get bombe
[2:46:56] fukus0da: 151 hp or some shit
[2:46:58] rhidy: can also get hunter pet to tank boss during that flame thrower thing
[2:47:02] myzixttv: you look thrilled
[2:47:11] MajurDJ: no swap
[2:47:22] SneakyChalupa: reconsidering that lock tank LUL
[2:47:33] MajurDJ: unless you get stacks i guess, but most groups have been 1 tanking
[2:47:43] PippTheKid: shaman decoy totem also removes frozen stacks in second phase
[2:47:49] fukus0da: @StaysafeTV dont click button while moving it can bug
[2:47:53] thundercawp: 1st phase tank needs to pre run the moment he casts the fire cone or you will take stacks of the debuff, speed pot would help
[2:48:00] SneakyChalupa: Lock tank is fine though, just gonna be way harder
[2:48:23] PippTheKid: yes
[2:48:23] NotTheWheel: ye
[2:48:24] Drezfate: yes
[2:48:27] Mahca_: a little bit into the phase
[2:48:28] Ucerius: 10 seconds into it
[2:48:28] Lionkingler1: Nope waste
[2:48:30] maannyy_x: love a fap fight
[2:48:31] Mahca_: not right away
[2:48:32] OGFonzi: NO
[2:48:33] OGFonzi: waste
[2:48:34] xspeedietv: healers will need to mana pot
[2:48:34] PippTheKid: but shaman decoy totem also removes frozen stacks in second phase
[2:48:36] OGFonzi: its a waste
[2:48:37] Derdy_: fap on the the cast of the spell not at the start of the phase
[2:48:39] OlympicUSA: yes its back up for ultimate phase
[2:48:43] Sibernetiq: P2 EVERYONE START FAPPING
[2:48:43] Drezfate: Blrssing of freedom is amazing
[2:48:45] dispensaryttv: id rather mana pot tbh
[2:48:45] Humansoup: FAP sstvWAT Ummm Ok
[2:48:46] Mahca_: wait like 10 sec to fap
[2:48:47] OGFonzi: save it for last phase
[2:48:50] Drezfate: druids can shapesahift out of it
[2:48:56] Lionkingler1: Last phase
[2:48:58] ZinoLIVE: horde has it
[2:48:58] Nomiek: Shaman have freedom now
[2:49:02] ZinoLIVE: decoy totem
[2:49:04] Ucerius: 7-8 minutes
[2:49:04] windatar: 4 phases
[2:49:05] moovment2534: 4-7 min
[2:49:05] dispensaryttv: 5 mins
[2:49:05] fukus0da: 6-9 min
[2:49:07] Lionkingler1: 6 min for gamer
[2:49:14] dispensaryttv: we did 4min 40sec
[2:49:15] Drezfate: shaman can decoy totem
[2:49:26] romierome31: damn
[2:49:35] zath16: tahts scam log
[2:49:36] Lionkingler1: Chad gamer
[2:49:37] Mahca_: what
[2:49:38] NotTheWheel: KEKW
[2:49:38] Dmaceee: fake log
[2:49:38] dispensaryttv: holy shit
[2:49:40] fukus0da: chinese log
[2:49:40] linkitcraig: no way
[2:49:41] windatar: It only counted the last phase
[2:49:48] Lionkingler1: Its possible
[2:49:48] MajurDJ: thats gotta be like 1:40 last phase? idk lol
[2:49:49] Mahca_: feel like the phases take longer than that lol
[2:49:50] juicedawg: dont go for any top logs lmao
[2:49:56] romierome31: makes more sense yea
[2:49:58] zath16: People just edit files
[2:49:58] Aumua: doing your research like a 1337 g4m3r
[2:50:07] Dmaceee: its just counting the last phase
[2:50:08] Vicente_Prime: if it's a hunter maybe it was the feign death
[2:50:10] slizard93: MingLee
[2:50:12] PippTheKid: shaman decoy totem also removes frozen stacks in second phase
[2:50:15] woodgnomes: people are exploiting it
[2:50:15] windatar: The log is only picking up last phase
[2:50:16] Bronloch: never look at top parsers LUL
[2:50:17] Riv_VK: in my pug it was 7 mins
[2:50:22] MajurDJ: it might be a feign death thing fucking the logs
[2:50:23] NotTheWheel: Skill issue
[2:50:28] TheEndIsNear777: it reads "Last Pull" vs "Last Phase"
[2:50:31] TheEndIsNear777: I noticed that
[2:50:33] ajax_shank: hey staysafe
[2:50:39] ajax_shank: man i just wanna be done with m+ grind
[2:50:40] TheEndIsNear777: Last Pull said 7 mins, last phase read 1:40
[2:50:43] ajax_shank: so i can play sod
[2:50:45] ajax_shank: looks so fun
[2:51:00] NotTheWheel: maybe fap on a certain stack
[2:51:01] dispensaryttv: the ice phace is easy as fuck its like a regen phase just stop bombs and its easy
[2:51:11] epicninja808: anyone got this vid link?
[2:51:12] NotTheWheel: so like 3 stacks then fap
[2:51:28] Daffi_ow: im done with my m+ grind, surely 3.7 is enough lol
[2:51:35] OGFonzi: All ranged can focus bombs, but i saw some groups assigning someone too it. I.E. a hunter or boomkin
[2:51:36] samson1000: so the ned free action potions ?
[2:51:49] OGFonzi: my group assigned me (boomy) to it
[2:51:59] Lunights: anyone know if felhunter silence works to interrupt that?
[2:52:35] zath16: Can horde do the quest yet?
[2:52:44] Daffi_ow: i only play sub tho, not poopypoo outlaw, and i mostly managed to pug it to 3.6, and found a team to do 3.7 with
[2:52:45] Lionkingler1: Its very easy
[2:52:46] SoopTV: yes pls :D

[2:53:01] zath16: I heard horde cant get dungarees
[2:53:05] windatar: It's easy for people that know how to play, but I can see pugs failing in here easily.
[2:53:06] MajurDJ: what makes it "bad" is everyone being stuck in level 25 BFD gear with lower HP/mana pools than what the raid is designed for
[2:53:18] OGFonzi: i suggest assigning someone to bombs I.e > hunter
[2:53:19] xspeedietv: I like how sarthe put his face over people's vods

[2:54:11] Drezfate: first gnomer boss easier than any bfd boss
[2:54:16] MajurDJ: gas clouds spawn faster than adds so you end up with a bunch of clouds that you just cant clear if it goes too long
[2:54:18] OGFonzi: nature prots are cheap, at the worst u can grab those
[2:54:20] Mahca_: just make sure you have room for clouds
[2:54:33] Mahca_: hard dps switch
[2:54:35] perturb25: yo @StaysafeTV have u heard anything about the shadowy figure being bugged for the epic prof gear?
[2:54:43] CrimsonBar0n: Not a single one of these videos can pronounce the names right lmao
[2:54:48] OGFonzi: nature prots for ele boss is lowkey goated

[2:56:40] windatar: This raid is very not pug friendly.
[2:56:44] Mahca_: i had melee heavy pug and we did fine
[2:56:49] Riv_VK: yo ucan assign just 2 people tbh
[2:56:50] Dmaceee: @staysafetv we didnt even do it that way, theres an easier way to do it
[2:56:52] kaiuwe322: its easy. if you dont have a debuff - move far. thats it
[2:56:56] Mahca_: you assign a filler
[2:56:59] OGFonzi: it always targets the furthest target
[2:57:03] perturb25: yo @StaysafeTV have u heard anything about the shadowy figure being bugged for the epic prof gear?
[2:57:08] Dmaceee: @staysafetv Bro theres an easier way for elecutioner

[2:58:31] Sunyankzi: That's Graysfordays raid group.
[2:58:34] OGFonzi: 5 or 6 stacks not sure which one, its 1k dmg a second
[2:58:38] OGFonzi: its healable. but not ideal
[2:58:57] romierome31: no one is healing 1k dps lmao

[3:08:33] BreakingSeth: and just have 2 grps stack on boss
[3:08:42] BreakingSeth: on ea side
[3:08:51] Dmaceee: YES i was saying that
[3:08:55] BreakingSeth: closest to them
[3:09:02] lickmypetals: just have 1 hunter eat the lightning stack , he can los it behind the pillars and take 0 damage
[3:09:07] OGFonzi: correct
[3:09:12] lickmypetals: naw u just use 1 hunter
[3:09:14] BreakingSeth: 1 person left side would move out
[3:09:16] sulsnipe: I just did it 15mins go it’s 3 people
[3:09:18] OGFonzi: so realistically u can form a triangle around teh boss
[3:09:20] sulsnipe: your right
[3:09:25] Dmaceee: @StaysafeTV we had 2 healers, who literally just rotated the debuff and ran into the melee
[3:09:28] Dmaceee: 0 issues
[3:09:30] BreakingSeth: then when u get next bolt right side would move out and left side would go back in
[3:09:41] earlmillions_: its 3, if anyone gets it back to back they die
[3:09:47] Dmaceee: yes, melee never moved
[3:09:49] sotien02: 2 melee mvoe to that side
[3:09:55] sotien02: other melee move over right
[3:09:57] lickmypetals: the best way ive seen it is , hunter near middle area at max range , when he goes to shock hunter los behind pillar and doesnt get hit

[3:33:55] Alpentalic: 10 secons I think
[3:33:57] Getblown: ...
[3:34:15] Vashury1: do you play the stv trinket then?
[3:34:24] Mawshaw: Just equip the rune and see if your dodge changes?
[3:34:54] shalomski: You get like 75 stam via priest/warrior and hunter

[3:36:29] Draxamius: morning from UK dude - Gnomer today?
[3:36:47] Cereal_Killa: then when u crit with dance u are unhittable

[3:36:51] cjadude: ?
[3:36:53] afrocalypse9: it works
[3:36:54] Monduk77: yea thats a poretty good combo
[3:36:55] afrocalypse9: yes
[3:36:59] Alpentalic: yeah its really good
[3:37:01] Humansoup: Kenin Costner ?
[3:37:01] Cereal_Killa: no u would have more
[3:37:02] vapenation_gg: No ! ;p
[3:37:03] Mawshaw: Pepega Whoa no way Pepega
[3:37:06] dispensaryttv: yeah those 2 really good together
[3:37:07] Cereal_Killa: cause it would be 30 x2
[3:37:08] Monduk77: it seems to be giving more than 2 percent mana too
[3:37:16] C00kie1337: Dance with the Wolves? isnt that a kevin costner movie? Kappa
[3:37:18] afrocalypse9: thats how some locks level in SM 30-40 right now
[3:37:22] Pulleft: rogues are meant to be dodge tank not warlocks smh
[3:37:24] dispensaryttv: DWW does give way more than 2% mana
[3:37:30] Getblown: where is the link for your gum company?
[3:37:37] Krabue: rfc
[3:37:37] EffinsTV: You would think they would remodel character tab in SOD. Lol
[3:37:40] Getblown: k ty
[3:37:51] Robmit: yea the mana is bugged right now, its not giving 2%, its giving  your crit% of your max mana back also
[3:37:52] Cereal_Killa: and u just searing pain spam with the talent and hope u crit
[3:37:54] Robmit: probably gonna get hot fixed
[3:38:06] Pulleft: :O
[3:38:07] haodab: where was the dps overview you showed of gnomer?
[3:38:11] Kevnxd: huge
[3:38:25] Monduk77: and u dont need to tap either
[3:38:28] norfh: I thought you did omega order on gum? Did sales go nutty?
[3:38:30] Cereal_Killa: and the additional 30% while demonic grace is active
[3:38:42] ItsMeWinkks: 1 raiders from ItsMeWinkks have joined! 
[3:38:43] Cereal_Killa: so for a time u get to like 80%
[3:38:43] VeZzE666: 50
[3:38:44] Wutanggggg: 46
[3:38:45] Ryafl1: 50% is crazy
[3:38:54] Humansoup: But you can buy the last box 4 $1500 if you want some @Getblown
[3:38:57] EffinsTV: 46% + 4% = 50%
[3:38:58] xlidgames: 50% is a rogue's evasion
[3:39:11] WestiiaK: Like a real wizard, doding shit
[3:39:16] EffinsTV: nice to get overpowered, oop
[3:39:20] typer___iban: yes very warlock-esque
[3:39:22] Pulleft: is 20% crit enough to keep it up
[3:39:30] VeZzE666: And it makes sure you crit easier
[3:39:49] Cereal_Killa: 80% dodge chance right there
[3:39:50] swagrlicious: Are you able to keep it up permanentely? no internal cdf?
[3:39:55] typer___iban: HUH
[3:40:03] Cereal_Killa: its because demonic grace adds 30%
[3:40:06] gary_ontwitch: gnomer buff gives 4% crit too so that will help uptime
[3:40:07] patchesohoulihan1: it stacks
[3:40:09] Pulleft: wtf stacking?
[3:40:12] Cereal_Killa: and ur getting another 30% with the crit
[3:40:28] typer___iban: wtf
[3:40:32] Pulleft: try it on mobs ur level
[3:40:37] Cereal_Killa: plus in meta ur searing pain spamming constantly
[3:40:48] Cereal_Killa: the question is if u recrit
[3:40:53] zaebot3000: You just had 80% for 6 seconds
[3:40:54] XarcTV: but it all helps
[3:40:58] EffinsTV: @StaysafeTV check in your spellbook, that might just be the ECS addon not working properly.
[3:41:00] haodab: where was the dps overview you showed of gnomergan? i cant find it
[3:41:05] WestiiaK: try a chain pull of like 4 crits
[3:41:07] Cereal_Killa: do u lose the 30% or does it overlap
[3:41:11] Wutanggggg: means demonic pact is better
[3:41:25] Pulleft: still thats turbogay in pvp
[3:41:51] Wutanggggg: pretty good tank stuff right there
[3:41:53] Cereal_Killa: see u just overwrote ur own buff and went from 50% to 20 with another crit
[3:42:01] Cereal_Killa: so u have to not crit again for 15 seconds
[3:42:07] Pancakeryder: dude a guys got me enslaved
[3:42:09] WestiiaK: and 2,7k armor on that
[3:42:20] yews: That's insane for last boss in gnomer to avoid the big hits
[3:43:25] patchesohoulihan1: searing pain has 30% crit
[3:43:34] Pulleft: bruh with the new mage heal, if someone kicks it, you get locked out of all trees lmfao
[3:43:34] Cereal_Killa: it is cause u can see fire crit at the bottom is also 20.66
[3:43:34] whatever: yoyo
[3:43:37] patchesohoulihan1: demonic is 60,
[3:43:39] Pulleft: yoyo
[3:43:40] XarcTV: thats cap too right
[3:43:41] patchesohoulihan1: plus isn’t buff
[3:43:46] patchesohoulihan1: Int
[3:43:51] Humansoup: I'm 49 If I Crit.. I do it Eazy.. Never trust a fart past 40Yr old
[3:44:08] XarcTV: for melee crit cap was like 60% i think
[3:44:09] patchesohoulihan1: and 4% gnomer buff
[3:44:12] Mmmarcoman: payoCc payoCc payoCc
[3:44:20] whatever: have all the runes been found?
[3:44:29] wahedje: !server

[3:44:48] indocl0ud: meelee hunter?
[3:44:49] zaebot3000: Fire mages would make your fire dmg do more too I think @StaysafeTV
[3:44:49] patchesohoulihan1: boomkin gives crit right
[3:44:50] Nomiek: Melee hunter
[3:44:52] patchesohoulihan1: ?
[3:45:00] Nomiek: Its very strong atm
[3:45:03] Osmosi: looks like alot of cloth gear being wanted lol
[3:45:11] patchesohoulihan1: oh it’s not raid wide ?
[3:45:17] Cereal_Killa: thats 3% dodge tho
[3:45:34] yews: Rip that melee hunter not having a feral
[3:45:44] vapenation_gg: VisLaud Fun when
[3:45:45] typer___iban: so with Demonic Grace and Dance, you fluctuate between 50-80% dodge?
[3:45:57] Pulleft: sit on back flag as meta KEKW
[3:46:05] XarcTV: constant evasion in pvp is toxic KEKW
[3:46:25] vapenation_gg: PogU over confident thats good
[3:46:29] sweatlordkush: you will get one shot 100%
[3:46:34] patchesohoulihan1: well as meta

[3:46:49] XarcTV: casters can still clap u up a bit
[3:46:51] Ingame: thise are low level mobs...

[4:40:26] Moeshanks: ppl who rush to 40 and all the content then say theres nothing to do is how we got to retail
[4:40:27] zenity360: @eshonxv Ulduar had a higher peak than any point in time classic vanilla had, by quite a bit. It wasn't naxx.

[4:41:03] koffingz96: alts and pvp, thats enough
[4:41:07] EffinsTV: I quit classic Wrath at the end of P1 too. It was just unbearable PVE and PVP wise. Full of GDKPs and R1 multigazzilionglads. Rly bad in terms of player interaction.
[4:41:08] traskadept: pvp pvp pvp
[4:41:09] osopolar1977: once it’s dead it’s dead
[4:41:11] eshonxv: @zenity360 again padded by alt armies and gdkps, classic most ppl had 1-2 classes max
[4:41:16] gary_ontwitch: theres a lot more quests at 40
[4:41:17] IR_ish: is your imp ever going to attack something?
[4:41:18] PatchesMcPatch: well, im taking my time leveling instead of degen-ing dungeon spams like a spaz. so its gonna last longer for me
[4:41:18] reefo: nah not much to do
[4:41:19] nicoladen: epic mount is 1k...and for all the alts too :D
[4:41:20] benutzer300: the casual dont play 12h a day
[4:41:21] gary_ontwitch: casuals love quests

[4:41:45] Sinamun1: might be true but then you can play other games and come back in phase 3
[4:41:45] sickymalo: what about hardcore tho
[4:41:51] bikersrocha: leveling is part of content
[4:41:53] zenity360: @eshonxv Classic was filled with an army of alts in naxx gdkps? One of the biggest things about classic was latty getting what 200k for the gressel
[4:42:14] Link9286: gressils going for 800-1.2mil on era
[4:42:22] nicoladen: well I don't know but is SoD really aiming for the hardcore crowd?

[4:42:40] zoldren: GIGACHAD
[4:42:40] bikersrocha: hahaha
[4:42:40] bruceythekid: SoD is so dumb, they took bad ideas and made them reality, warlock tanks, rogue tanks, basically all the ideas nobody ever wanted or asked for, and said "this is classic+"
[4:42:41] p1ss_minion_suit: LOL
[4:42:43] sweatlordkush: BASED BUBBLE ANDY

[4:43:32] zenity360: casters are king right now outside of melee hunter in gnomergan
[4:43:44] Frayeen: Gdkp kept the raid scene alive in p1. Without it people will just quit after they get bis on 1-3 chars in one month
[4:43:50] IR_ish: is there a reason why your imp isn't doing anythihng?

[5:36:27] PrimalTV: Missed most of the convo in the ads but the reason I'd be a proponent for lowering the age is that it affects their future quite heavily, so I agree with a cap on the voting age too. I appreciate you have to draw the line somewhere, so for us 18 seems logical, otherwise it's a slippery slope, but speaking from a UK perspective in the wake of Brexit and having old people consistently fuck you over is rough, considering more ~16 year olds seem more clued up on current affairs than those older

[5:44:08] eshonxv: why does it always come back to drumpf with these ppl ICANT
[5:44:13] Rindu: memelords dont belong in oval office
[5:44:20] Dracksar: @dremm_tft and pls tell us about who you voted for
[5:44:21] Crawstorm: @StaysafeTV one question do you care if its left or right when you vote?
[5:44:22] steevwtf: the people on TV told him Trump is a bad man and he believes it
[5:44:29] gr0um: ad trumpinem
[5:44:36] dipchit1: @azhadii what if only land owners could vote like the founding fathers intended
[5:44:44] AmarokUnchained: something
[5:44:47] vapenation_gg: u wont find it in twitch chat ;p
[5:44:53] azhadii: @dipchit1 I like it.]
[5:44:53] Knaldstiv: if you say american are dumb, you are sub 90iq
[5:44:54] dremm_tft: didn't call them dumb though
[5:44:56] dytallix87: I just want an answer as to why god allowed 13 year olds to become pregnant
[5:45:00] Fredthegred: americans fat something something mcdonalds BASEDCIGAR
[5:45:06] maldemer_: none of trumps kids have a drug problem like smoking crack so i'd prefer his leadership

[5:45:17] Nek0r: KKona
[5:45:21] MajesticAFx: @maldemer_ youre not wrong. aware
[5:45:31] linkitcraig: sstvNPC orange man bad
[5:45:31] Venotorious: Wisdom in earned in a linear fashion through time and experience. Informed voting requires both knowledge and wisdom. The smartest 17 year old just hasn't seen enough. Hasnt had the time to think about enough.
[5:45:33] wraith1220: @dytallix87 because life expectancy back then was like 35
[5:45:34] Gostaw: January 6th was an attempt to overthrow the government
[5:45:34] WeeNeeber: Trump bad because I was told to say this
[5:45:35] pretty_cool_guy: that would require them to actually think
[5:45:37] davemkii: It's disingenuous especially when you consider it's a two horse race. Even if you don't 100% support Trump, he's the lesser of two evils
[5:45:45] Arawnik: Trump downtalking and shaking NATO on days like we have atm is super irresponsible and could cause a lot of bad things globally
[5:45:45] eshonxv: trump bad, upvotes to the left ty
[5:45:48] epicninja808: ah yes the horde bg experience
[5:45:48] Nek0r: "orange man is bad"... it's getting old
[5:45:57] dytallix87: @wraith1220 thats cute
[5:45:58] madabber_: @maldemer_ the fact i can google "hunter biden smoking crack" and a video of him doing comes up is crazy... trumps kids would NEVER
[5:46:03] steevwtf: sir, i would rather just agree with most people, thats how i know im right :)
[5:46:08] h2h_nillz: @staysafetv Yo what addon you using for your raid frames my man?
[5:46:11] itsEviax: Most people are easily manipulated by the media and that's the problem. They aren't dump jus falling for shit.
[5:46:14] Synmachus: Once again, most leftists simply CANNOT fathom people on the internet being conservative
[5:46:15] vap33: i think we all know.. lol
[5:46:16] ScarfaceCEO: Yeah , talking points parroting is boring.
[5:46:16] nillgren: You think there should be a age limit as a president? Seems to be a real problem with biden atm
[5:46:17] FranklyFranklin: Trump seems more crazy when he isnt in office than when he is
[5:46:18] Falkorez: Should participating in politics be mandatory and one must choose a preferred party?
[5:46:22] jagdtiger_00: can anyone name one document he signed that went well
[5:46:25] dipchit1: @madabber_ i like the one where he gets a blowjob while watching his dad give a speech on tv
[5:46:28] pretty_cool_guy: OMEGALUL OMEGALUL
[5:46:30] ca_Y_z: hes not allowed to earn a dime. the curriculum is funded by government. its how the real world works
[5:46:32] Knaldstiv: Pepega
[5:46:33] Genghish: Bro I love this stream sooo much, all other streams: ye no politics here (censure)
[5:46:37] Dracksar: cause he cant say anything
[5:46:38] iscamog: I'll say it. He's obese.
[5:46:38] Balverine117: biggest problem with Trump was his President self not being his Candidate self
[5:46:43] Dracksar: they never actually say why
[5:46:45] castle_milk: Give us the Putin 30 minute history lesson on why you think Trump is bad
[5:46:47] Kevnxd: Half of the population voted for him but we "ALL" know.. ok dude
[5:46:50] KKonaStevieG: @h2h_nillz just the blizzard raid frames adjusted
[5:46:51] vap33: i mean look at the state of the world

[5:46:57] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: Trump is unpredictable, thats the biggest issue
[5:46:59] AmarokUnchained: @Arawnik even Stoltenberg agreed with Trump that the memberstates dont pay their fair share
[5:47:01] MajesticAFx: tell us why hes bad without regurgitating main stream media talking points.
[5:47:04] madabber_: @dipchit1 nah my favorite is him arguing how much crack it is...mans aruging over .01 of crack
[5:47:07] Knaldstiv: @vap33 who is president right now?
[5:47:08] pgm128: @StaysafeTV When you buy your home.... can it have a closet? So we can have old school intellectual streams once a week???
[5:47:10] andyjamesgames: "Central Park 5" was pretty bad look for Trump
[5:47:14] WeeNeeber: Trump is a bad face for American imperialism
[5:47:15] Dracksar: he is googling why right now give him a few mins
[5:47:23] Venotorious: I think there's a space opening up in our American political landscape for legit 3rd party. Something libertarian adjacent with liberal global politics.
[5:47:25] Reach_1989: i feel like tictok is to blame why people think dumb shit
[5:47:25] nillgren: It's not a opinion, it's others opinons that he copys and he doesnt know why
[5:47:26] madabber_: @ClassicWorldOfWarcraft biden doesnt have a working brain
[5:47:26] largist_: as Finnish person Trumps takes on Putin,Russia/Nato are VERY conserning
[5:47:27] eshonxv: maybe that opinion was implanted by media etc
[5:47:29] steevwtf: its because news media says so and so do my friends! they cant be wrong!
[5:47:30] 13lade1: Trump has degraded politics and ethics.
[5:47:30] Aeycka__: @vap33 explain it like you would to a person that has been in a coma for the last 20 years
[5:47:33] dragevegard: 91 felony counts, countless rape accusations, threatening to pull out or let russia do what they want if nato countries dont pay up
[5:47:40] dytallix87: 18 is the legal age because dads want their children to finish highschool
[5:47:45] Crawstorm: honestly anyone who sees left or right in america isent really seeing the problem with the current political situation. when you have a ruling class that wanna keep the population dumbed down.
[5:47:45] ca_Y_z: the school program costs around 20k. anyone should be thankful
[5:47:48] AmarokUnchained: TTrump damn right
[5:47:49] Knaldstiv: ever prob
[5:47:53] Metaphix: way longer
[5:47:58] Metaphix: maybe since carter
[5:47:58] Nek0r: easily
[5:48:03] Fluffshock: trump wanted to stop the wars
[5:48:04] madabber_: @Crawstorm ding ding ding
[5:48:05] iscamog: he loves israel
[5:48:14] Feralroar: Trump is much better than any other candidate. He is still serving the goblins though.
[5:48:14] Grommox95: Biden is a nonce
[5:48:16] CrossNF: he loves China
[5:48:17] Tobssessxic: KKonaW  Trump no.1
[5:48:25] Link9286: "i hope we dont find life on other planets because the democrats would find a way to send them money"
[5:48:27] jagdtiger_00: @StaysafeTV can you name 1 document he signed that was beneficial to us
[5:48:37] andyjamesgames: @Link9286 LUL
[5:48:39] 13lade1: @StaysafeTV Trump has eroded morality and ethics, hes made things acceptable that shouldnt be, and there is so much venom in political discourse due to his populism
[5:48:40] yeahiknow_513: I can't help but think, did cops just stop killing people the last 3 years.
[5:48:40] Knaldstiv: not right now
[5:48:44] Metaphix: monkaLaugh
[5:48:49] Nek0r: 😏
[5:48:49] scalzy92: why are the us and Isrrael so tight ?
[5:48:51] bigb0omer: hell yeah
[5:48:56] iscamog: that's why you should elect PRESIDENT CENK
[5:48:57] ca_Y_z: pardon: 30k
[5:49:00] SupreemLeeder11: YEP reason enough for me
[5:49:02] gunner2132: its funny to me that people say trump is imperialist, but they also complain when he doesnt intervene to assist in other countries' issues
[5:49:03] dipchit1: @13lade1 i would say obama much more guilty of that
[5:49:04] vap33: because its already full lol
[5:49:06] dremm_tft: lol
[5:49:07] dragevegard: because of covid prob
[5:49:08] AmarokUnchained: now the US has a ALLTIME high
[5:49:10] sadopvp: maybe an upper agelimit for candidates would solve alot of problems in the US :)
[5:49:11] kuruixd: the thing i understand the least about american politics is how their debates work, its such a shitshow and it feels like all they do is smear their opponent rather than talk about their own politics KEKW
[5:49:14] FranklyFranklin: Trump seemingly wants to reduce nato support, which and EU like me worries about
[5:49:17] eshonxv: nice work trump
[5:49:20] Metaphix: @scalzy92 because they are our strongest ally monkaLaugh
[5:49:24] davemkii: I think an upper age limit for presidency is a good idea
[5:49:25] Arawnik: Timing for going full domestic and telling russia to do whatever is pretty bad at times like this isn't it @StaysafeTV ?
[5:49:27] vapenation_gg: PogU HUGE WALL
[5:49:42] dytallix87: western men are so brainwashed. we have no say in our government
[5:49:43] pgm128: @StaysafeTV This is a perfect example why some people shouldn't vote. People can't separate the personal side of trump from the effective politician side of Trump.
[5:50:00] AmarokUnchained: look at the young ones: AoC, Rashida Tliab,
[5:50:01] bigb0omer: we need a cap limit on driving privileges as well
[5:50:03] itsEviax: @FranklyFranklin That's because other NATO countries aren't serious about NATO themselves and do not contribute enough but rely on America and America only. He is right about that and certainly not Putin's man because of that.
[5:50:03] largist_: and from EU perspective Trumps focus on inside politics and  big disrespect for out politics is concerning, ofc own nation first but still
[5:50:05] AmarokUnchained: ICANT
[5:50:05] Knaldstiv: the people that run the government are there forever
[5:50:05] nillgren: What if you find the best president possible, itsn't it sad that you are forced to leave after two periods?
[5:50:08] ca_Y_z: its actually 40k. doesnt matter. the momentum stays at g
[5:50:16] cinotv2: How about using more resources on improving the american health care system, instead of dumping money into keeping people away
[5:50:19] Crawstorm: honestly anyone talking about any of the president elects as a solution wont ever see a solution :P first of all ppl gotta get educated problems are starting in school with indoctrination of wrong values and efforts stupidity is being awarded in society.
[5:50:22] send_it5010: trump and Biden are both way too old to effectively deal with the stress of being the president. both of them have shown signs of reduced mental capacity and we need to change the age paradigm in the govt
[5:50:25] dytallix87: WE HAVE NO SAY IN OUR GOVERNMENT HOW DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT BY NOW
[5:50:29] azhadii: You know who I'd vote for if they could pull that off? Someone rich enough to pay them all off.
[5:50:34] linkitcraig: are they voting on the insider trading thing?
[5:50:38] Shreddingly: I am not sure how lowering immigration benefit a country that is also having lower birth rates in the long run when current working force retires?
[5:50:40] Venotorious: I'd vote for Trump because he has the cajones to meet the North Korean leader in his land and shake his hand. It takes immense bravery to do that with the enemy.
[5:50:48] samoeeee: @scalzy92 Lets quote biden on that: "If there wasnt an Israel, we would have to invent one"  Basically Israel serves the US interests in the area
[5:51:03] Knaldstiv: thats just COPIUM
[5:51:07] beckdev: @StaysafeTV I was born in Sweden but lived in the us when I was younger. Now im back to Sweden and let me tell you, I WISH Trump was in charge here.
[5:51:10] eshonxv: why not both?
[5:51:15] dytallix87: we are disallusioned to think we have a say
[5:51:16] Rindu: after watching the interview with Putin i've realised neither Biden nor Trump could hold a logic conversation with this man for more than 10 minutes, they simply lack the mental capacity
[5:51:21] AmarokUnchained: BASED Clap
[5:51:25] PropagandaArtist: @StaysafeTV If i can only get a few things out about trump it would be the way he can lie, be caught about lying and brush it off like its not insanity. Now everyone lies, atleast politicians. But Trump is overly confident about it. Trump also changes what happend all the time in a retrospective way. Also, its such a wicked trait to turn on everyone who dosnt immedietly stand behind all his decisions to 100%. He also strongly get what he wants done and the reason he can do that is because he
[5:51:28] PropagandaArtist: He dosnt need to consider other peoples wellbeing. So for example, the reason he had low numbers of boarder crossing is because he put them in overcrowded prisons. Children too.  Seperating the children from their parents. They didnt really get any basic stuff like a toothbrush etc.
[5:51:29] TallTrips: @Shreddingly Illegal immigration, can incluse drugs and child trafficking
[5:51:32] MilesPro91: HOLY
[5:51:38] Nek0r: BASEDCIGAR
[5:51:40] Majinbrew: America first baby
[5:51:41] SupreemLeeder11: YEP let isreal and palestine nuke each other, problem solved
[5:51:43] SleepyB0x: @StaysafeTV What's your take on the insane prices of just living (rent etc.) in the US?
[5:51:45] Highkriger: nice copy pasta
[5:51:51] Pureblue: At least in Europe the border crisis has been amplified or even orchestrated by RUSSIA for years now. I can imagine them being behind some of it for the US as well.
[5:51:52] Gaura1337: @PropagandaArtist Do you have examples of these lies?
[5:51:52] Polerize: losing ground no matter how much you pump into the system when million come every year
[5:51:53] muesliqq: thats sadge tho, nato/europe is kinda fucked without a U.S. that stands beind them :<
[5:51:56] Knaldstiv: @PropagandaArtist obama did that too
[5:51:57] Gostaw: Does this only extent to current events, or in the past aswell.
[5:52:04] Genghish: Based
[5:52:05] Knaldstiv: BASED
[5:52:05] Shreddingly: @Shreddingly Sure but Trump lowered all king of immigration compared to anyone before him
[5:52:06] aerodynam1c: TRUE
[5:52:07] beckdev: @StaysafeTV I was born in Sweden but lived in the us when I was younger. Now im back to Sweden and let me tell you, I WISH Trump was in charge here.
[5:52:08] basic94: preach
[5:52:09] bigkuntey: same YEP
[5:52:10] Venotorious: American Nationalist = Patriot
[5:52:12] Shreddingly: kind*
[5:52:14] MonsterTilin: I'm swedish hello world :)
[5:52:14] rekzm4n: That only works if all countries do that
[5:52:15] pretty_cool_guy: BASED
[5:52:15] dytallix87: stop pretending we have a say, we are controlled by a world government/UN/UK
[5:52:22] Speers_: German Nationalist monkaS
[5:52:33] the_dorner: god bless
[5:52:38] Seryam: what is your stance on NATO?
[5:52:39] WeeNeeber: Anti globalist streamer
[5:52:41] Genghish: Own people first makes a ton of sense but people say racism(im colored nationalist)
[5:52:41] Khoryace: Out in space two alien life forms are speaking with each other. The first alien says, "The dominant life forms on the earth planet have developed satellite-based nuclear weapons." The second alien, who looks exactly like the first, asks, "Are they an emerging intelligence?" The first alien says, "I don't think so, they have them aimed at themselves."
[5:52:43] ClassicWorldOfWarcraft: if you think you have no business in other countries, you are short sighted. We are living in a globalized world, everything effects you
[5:52:47] GolferTV: me as a german, we should invade france again
[5:52:52] PropagandaArtist: @Gaura1337 Just look it up yourself, please. You can surley find a colleciton of all his lies in video on youtube. And no it wont be manipulated
[5:52:52] Qristoffer: Ok so US conquer half the world and then go domestic politics, makes sense
[5:52:57] prettypandaren: RACIST DEVIL WORSHIPPER
[5:52:57] send_it5010: we live in a globalized world, there is not true pure national agenda. we are tied to the rest of the world and the world is tied to us
[5:52:57] Kebabra_: True, the UK feels this everyday
[5:53:02] dytallix87: we never get what we want every single year but we keep hoping an hoping again for change but it never fucking happenbs
[5:53:04] azhadii: When does this man run for office?
[5:53:05] dytallix87: happens*
[5:53:14] PropagandaArtist: @Knaldstiv No. No he did not.
[5:53:18] rekzm4n: Its naive to think some countries wont take (negative) advantage of US pulling back
[5:53:22] Knaldstiv: yes he did...
[5:53:24] beckdev: @StaysafeTV I was born in Sweden but lived in the us when I was younger. Now im back to Sweden and let me tell you, I WISH Trump was in charge here. Leftist parties have completly ruined this country the past 20 years.
[5:53:25] dytallix87: yeah keep hoping people
[5:53:27] kuruixd: they should just remove all borders and everyone should become nationalists for the whole planet :)
[5:53:28] samoeeee: Just cant fathom how people think Trump isnt a globalist
[5:53:31] PropagandaArtist: @Knaldstiv What? lock people up?
[5:53:32] wraith1220: not gonna happen man. it’s a slow burn from here on out
[5:53:34] sickymalo: thats a good point yea
[5:53:35] Knaldstiv: yes
[5:53:37] b00zifer: I'm a globalist. I believe nationalism is a remnant of the dark ages and that we need to find ways to work together as a planet in order to progress.
[5:53:37] Shreddingly: From my limited understanding of the american political landscape, I seem to side more with Bernie Sanders political views, and I never understood why he isnt more popular among american citizens
[5:53:54] Maifraind: staysafe president
[5:53:57] Marveck: The latest stats confirm that 74.5% of trump voters have sexual intercourse with their relatives
[5:53:57] crozleyg: @Kebabra_ Yep
[5:53:58] Metaphix: "but china will fill the void" i say fuck it let them
[5:54:02] ShadeburnOfficial: ill be okay with taxes here in america, when i get a say in how they are spent. Giving other countries BILLIONS for research/war/etc is tough.
[5:54:09] Crawstorm: @StaysafeTV think in the last 2000 years the world have had a total of 360 years of peace
[5:54:12] TheFreedomLover: The fact that Trump and Biden are the best that USA can bolster i just crazy to me
[5:54:13] madabber_: @Marveck well thats just not true
[5:54:13] Aeycka__: @StaysafeTV in Finland the left is facing an interesting dilemma -> the "Refugees welcome" policies have been in place for ~20 years -> the young Finnish men are resigning out of army because they don't feel like defending foreigners -> now the left is trying to paint them as "not appreciative of their country" aka "non-nationalistic" :D Funny paradox
[5:54:14] dipchit1: @Shreddingly wdym he was popular, look into what happened in 2016 primaries
[5:54:16] PropagandaArtist: @Knaldstiv So if i look it up i will find those inhumane conditions happening then too?
[5:54:23] Knaldstiv: yes 󠀀
[5:54:25] sickymalo: or to get the free healthcare you have to be a citizien living in the country for like 10 years or something idk
[5:54:27] PropagandaArtist: Ok brb
[5:54:39] Metaphix: BASED
[5:54:42] samoeeee: @Aeycka__ 1000 people resigning doesnt mean shit
[5:54:44] Knaldstiv: same all over europe
[5:54:48] Knaldstiv: its the same
[5:54:54] dytallix87: the whole world is dealing with this
[5:54:55] ripperofbong420: honestly i think youre engaging to much substance. alot of people have no opinion if its not a surface issue. you are talking solutions when most people are barely aware of the problem
[5:54:59] PropagandaArtist: @Knaldstiv Kids in cages’: It’s true that Obama built the cages at the border. But Trump’s ‘zero tolerance’ immigration policy had no precedent.
[5:55:01] dytallix87: its not just your country
[5:55:01] basic94: same for me, i´d never serve in the military
[5:55:06] Arawnik: as a finn I havent seen anything like that LUL
[5:55:10] dytallix87: its every country
[5:55:11] SpecialAgent_FeelsDankMan: 100% true
[5:55:18] juicedawg: my country was given away by politicians.. those politicians and their monkey pets can defend "my country"
[5:55:19] Knaldstiv: so im right
[5:55:19] Aeycka__: @Arawnik open up a newspaper
[5:55:21] Metaphix: yep, massive recruiting issues. Except marine corps. Marine corps is fine
[5:55:24] PropagandaArtist: so obama made the cages and trump made the inhumane
[5:55:27] pgm128: gee, I wonder why
[5:55:27] Link9286: they recently lowered the stansards
[5:55:28] Aeycka__: @samoeeee +400% increase in the resigning does mean shit
[5:55:34] Shreddingly: @Shreddingly When he lost to Hillary Clinton?
[5:55:34] EffinsTV: cuz military is racist and woke
[5:55:37] madabber_: @PropagandaArtist never could i believe a word you say with a name like that
[5:55:40] Nek0r: @ripperofbong420 yes exactly, and that's exactly why were talking about education/voting age before and such
[5:55:41] Curlypasta: how would you increase military signups @StaysafeTV
[5:55:44] EffinsTV: racist towards white
[5:55:46] dipchit1: good we dont need them to die in pointless shit anyway
[5:55:46] dytallix87: U.N. is trying to create a world war so they can take control
[5:55:47] Pureblue: only a few hundred has left the army though... that message was blown way out of proportion
[5:55:47] Arawnik: @Aeycka__ I do constantly
[5:55:48] DeadTriggr69: Donald Trump is a very bad president
[5:55:48] PropagandaArtist: @Knaldstiv so that was the important thing. to be right. Nice man
[5:55:54] WeeNeeber: 20 years of bullshit wars has an effect on recruitment
[5:55:55] DeadTriggr69: He destablaized the world economy
[5:55:55] Knaldstiv: military state funded so its woke as shit
[5:56:01] DeadTriggr69: and he destablized the WHO
[5:56:04] Aeycka__: @Arawnik do you know how to read?
[5:56:12] itsEviax: What's your stance on Ukraine invasion?
[5:56:12] Arawnik: @Arawnik and other sources of course. trusting only newspapers would be insane

I escaped with my family to Ireland, Dublin, just to be safe.I witnessed death.There is a hope for me that western world(including USA) will help us to defeat russian aggression. USA is a member of NATO, there are some agreements where in case of war all countries defend each other.Moreover USA has advanced military technologies that can finish this war.You are paying your taxes for being top tech military country in the world

[6:14:05] DeadTriggr69: @Knaldstiv, @madabber_ Donald Trump shutting off all immigration, ending all world political agreements, pulling our army out of the middle east with a deadline, attached so soon we'd never recover all equipment, created a situtaion where a vacumme of power could threaten russia and Ukraine, and Isreal...
[6:14:21] Draxamius: I do genuinely think US and UK have a pretty toxic relationship and I wish the UK stopped being cucked by them
[6:14:30] wsim9: @deadtriggr69 none of that ever happened?
[6:14:34] einself111: @StaysafeTV i disagree, your logic has massive flaws, the US can't stop being the "world police" or the $ will become worthless and the economy will crumble  :) all i got to say
[6:14:36] Chronollo: Trump is going against Biden in 2024?
[6:14:38] Knaldstiv: @DeadTriggr69, thats never gonna happen

[6:15:37] johnsmith_cb: nobody is sending american troops to play world police, its in americas interest
[6:15:39] NocivoLive: The day $ is worthless is not only USA in trouble.
[6:15:44] einself111: @socialdiff you are so clueless it is impressive
[6:15:54] DeadTriggr69: @Knaldstiv @wsim9 what exactly did he do... to trade commerece and imigration during his presidency
[6:15:55] wsim9: @deadtriggr69 where did you hear that lol
[6:15:58] Humansoup: Based and Based
[6:16:01] dipchit1: @DeadTriggr69 Trump gave a year and a half timeline for the drawdown, and Biden extended that to 2 years. If you think thats not enough time youre delusional

[6:16:04] DeadTriggr69: @wsim9, I lived under trump stupid

[6:16:05] iscamog: bring the british empire back and strap houthi pirates to the ends of cannons
[6:16:06] Arawnik: @einself111 it's a fresh russki account that came to troll

[6:16:26] Bawls_hang_low: Warlocks are weak in pvp now ?
[6:16:31] DeadTriggr69: @dipchit1, so 2 years to clear 300billion dollars of equipment?
[6:16:31] warsickk: is it just me or do you also feel like warlock is currently very weak in pvp ?
[6:16:35] SleepyJerome: or 2014 CIA coup in Ukraine
[6:16:36] AxelFromAustralia: why did the CIA admit they can astral project and view anyone from anywhere?
[6:16:40] nobunaga0daa: NATO could stop this nonsense 2 years ago just by giving all necessary weapons with jets to Ukraine, russia would collapse as USSR did back in a day. China, russia, Iran and North Korea are looking at what happening nowadays and they understand that they can do whatever they want without being punished
[6:16:47] wsim9: @deadtriggr69 there was still immigration under trump. stop watching marxist propaganda
[6:16:53] DeadTriggr69: @dipchit1, can you plan a plan to clear 300 billion dollars of equipment in 2 years without causing destablization
[6:16:57] JustyoXD: isnt the world and the base of what is has been build make it too late to make a good world? its 2024 and country are still at war who learn from history
[6:16:58] dipchit1: @DeadTriggr69 do you have any idea what US military logistics are like?

[6:17:04] SinicalDev: man your chat is being astroturfed to fuck lol
[6:17:06] EffinsTV: @StaysafeTV Interventions in ME were done to benefit big American Corporations, not the US citizen.
[6:17:13] DeadTriggr69: @dipchit1, you could be that general huh in this twitch chat
[6:17:21] dytallix87: U.N. is the proxy of the U.S.

[6:17:34] wraith1220: Fairly conservative here, however I really got behind Joe Biden when he said, “We will no longer continue to fight for a country that refuses to fight for itself.”
[6:17:35] ripperofbong420: what?? lol
[6:17:37] DeadTriggr69: @wsim9, was there an open border under trump?

[6:17:48] Eisenzhan: that would literally mean ww3 lol
[6:17:49] Omahasteaks: Ukraine WAS going into Russian territory
[6:17:51] Knaldstiv: you idiots

[6:17:52] siremethyr: DEAD
[6:17:52] chasingshadowsz: I like NATOs hot pepper sauce
[6:17:53] yurchelioz: @StaysafeTV do you know anything about budapest memorandum?
[6:17:54] dytallix87: ukraine is the proxy of the U.S.
[6:17:58] iscamog: they are already with drones and it's great
[6:18:01] Humansoup: Yep and Yep WIII
[6:18:03] Mmmarcoman: Its reciprocal, why nukes then?

[6:18:33] Arawnik: 100%
[6:18:36] getmegone2: but they do it regulary
[6:18:38] dipchit1: @DeadTriggr69 the equipment that was left was left intentionally, the general in charge stated that himself, cheaper to leave it. It wasnt because they ran out of time, you made that up
[6:18:40] dytallix87: @socialdiff it is you fucking retard. do you research on the recent history of ukraine.
[6:18:45] Nek0r: Clueless
[6:18:45] DeadTriggr69: We lost 85 billion dollars of military equipment before Oct 7th
[6:18:48] Knaldstiv: also ukraine is corrupt as shit
[6:18:55] wsim9: @deadtriggr69 they tried to stop more illigals, but it was still open like it always is
[6:18:56] biiglong: Have you talked about starlink possibly beeing used by the russians?
[6:18:56] madabber_: @DeadTriggr69 2 year plan. dont die
[6:18:58] Venotorious: Yes but in doing so we've sapped their ability to launch counter-offensives in general.
[6:19:04] iscamog: not as corrupt as russia
[6:19:05] PowerKasten: haha yeah
[6:19:07] Knaldstiv: so much of the money is going into pockets of the leaders
[6:19:10] drencro: cant oil companies hire a PMC's  they have the money
[6:19:17] Venotorious: But giving them limited tool, your handicap the idea of combined arms
[6:19:18] Humansoup: Yep WHo
[6:19:25] appleboater: NATO is a defence coalition and Ukraine is not a part of NATO. It is not NATOs place to help Ukraine.  However, each individual country can decide to help Ukraine
[6:19:28] iscamog: @socialdiff I'm against the current thing BatChest
[6:19:28] dytallix87: its fully of actually nazi's
[6:19:39] FranklyFranklin: if you saw anything from Ukraine you just called it Russia before the war
[6:19:41] dytallix87: nazi's fled there
[6:19:47] DeadTriggr69: @dipchit1, so the Taliban closing in on a weakened military base, didn't encourage leaving "cheap" equipment from taxpayers, that equited almost 100billion dollars
[6:19:55] Omahasteaks: there are Nazi symbols IN the ukranian military
[6:19:56] itsEviax: People's impression that Russia is weak is most interesting to me.
[6:19:57] Jikzz: Surely somewhere in South Maerica or Africa there must be more corrupt countries
[6:20:00] Nille4mat: In germany? NO WAY

[6:20:19] einself111: there are a lot
[6:20:20] iscamog: @socialdiff having opinions is bad BatChest just copy paste whatever I read  on twatter or 4chan
[6:20:21] uzisd4: more like "is russia invading the us" lol
[6:20:21] Omahasteaks: the Dems spent 10 years calling Trump and the Republicans nazis, then gave actual, literal Nazis hundreds of billions
[6:20:25] its_jjk: There's a whole lot of Swastikas in Japan

[6:59:38] SL4SK3N: thats not good
[6:59:39] AmarokUnchained: lvl 25 was great
[6:59:41] cdubbdub: yeah looks dumb
[6:59:50] tussmack: a consequence of giving everyone too powerful runes
[6:59:50] Nomiek: Damage reduction
[6:59:54] Marksman91: more health
[6:59:54] Nomiek: Or the heals will suck
[6:59:57] perseay797: Yeah. They also removed 20% damage taken reduction in BGs, but increased hp by 20% which in my opinion is worse.
[7:00:00] fietsopa4: Frankly that sounds like a skill issue to me LULW
[7:00:03] Durlog: shadowpriests and boomkins are probably op with their level 40 forms
[7:00:03] dont_ban_this_name_twitch: its almost like resilience was a thing in pvp
[7:00:05] AmarokUnchained: i mean in WSG there was a hatpiece with +5% crit
[7:00:13] AmarokUnchained: *-5%
[7:00:18] fghtingspirit_2022: wait til 60 and the you will be one shot even harder
[7:00:18] TheL0m0o: 1 hp lol

[7:00:33] warboy80: druids are so much fun in sod… 🫠

[7:02:31] Infractus1: think someone bought it and handed it in, and didnt get any rep.. so was probably bugged
[7:02:35] doublemeat_: apparently it was bugged and wasnt giving rep so they removed it. But they are adding it back in? (cope)
[7:02:36] aerodynam1c: mount Pog

[7:02:55] haodab: the more people hit 40 now and the lagfest is insane on
[7:02:58] madabber_: @StaysafeTV stack coins until the lumber comes back?
[7:03:00] Kl1ppan: so people just wasted thier coins
[7:03:03] dipchit1: probably to make stv less of a shitshow
[7:03:10] largist_: werent u able trade coins for honor? but is it so low that BG is better
