[0:54:38] weebpulper: does he say it's exclusive to streaming?
[0:54:38] Icecolddonut: @the_do0d 50% of what he does is shit on anyone who doesnt agree with him in chat lol

[1:09:11] swaee: why doesnt hasan distribute his wealth to his viewers

[1:09:17] WillyBeamish: millionaire streamer defending millionaire streamer trying to defuse it hoping they dont then come for him
[1:09:19] jordano111: @RetrainYourBrain maybe cuz you're addicted to it and haven't read research that suggest it ruins your dopamine center and actually modifies your brain like some drugs do
[1:09:22] Aacro: Asmon isn't much brighter than Hasan
[1:09:22] Bronloch: HE WAS BORN RICH LUL

[1:13:34] WillyBeamish: why we acting like you can't live comfortably on a low income as long as you are responsible with your money
[1:13:36] zezella03: true and BASED
[1:13:37] fuguelah: The real reason why they stress themselves out streaming is because they believe the loss of some of their relevancy is not worth taking time off. I bet Hassan cares more about being prominent than he does his income.
[1:13:37] Utmost777: in SF 100k is poverty
[1:13:38] plaidshorts: yea 100k isnt much anymore

[1:16:11] KCYON: there is a lot less "job security". If you're done online, you're done (e.g. Rich Campbell)
[1:16:11] deepcalm: asmon's cope is that if he wasn't a streamer he would be a successful person in business either way
[1:16:13] caltex88: The skillset isn't totally untransferable.
[1:16:16] WillyBeamish: yes, if you go out of your way to get banned you will get banned, they will not ban you for no reason, we've seen that with other streamers

[1:17:48] jordano111: couldn't streamers unionize and get benefits or is that not possible, i have no idea
[1:17:52] SpaceGhost8: i think soda was one of the early ones to do that, idk how many houses he owns now LUL

[2:06:40] barakk14: leveling 25-40 is a lot and the gnomer gear vs how good bfd gear is the issue
[2:06:40] cAdams10: they've done a bad job of making there things to do outside of raid tbh.
[2:06:40] fuguelah: alts are back bby
[2:06:45] wavecadet: thats what they want you to do tbh
[2:06:53] itsae__: gnomer sucks and takes too long to run 5 alts through
[2:06:55] Slaanesh74: too little too late imo
[2:06:56] craboskai: they transformed season of discovery into season of reddit KEKL
[2:06:56] Garzag_: i got the epic fist weapon GIGACHAD
[2:06:56] mrwasdead: that's what happens with all versions of wow to be fair
[2:07:00] dirbagdan: i just finally grinded enough for a mount and now theyre reducing the price...
[2:07:01] keyboardwarrior32: need more dungeons with way lower drop rates to spam do something otherwise im just raid logging
[2:07:02] xrazzaks: i hit 2 40s to raid with and have found myself playing elden ring all of a sudden LUL
[2:07:02] hennessy147: wonder how many times sarthe will say ACTUALLY
[2:07:09] madgarlicjr: i have a job, i just no lifed era for a year, 1-25 was fun to no life, but im takikng wow very casually right now for p2
[2:07:10] Slaanesh74: Gnomeregan was a mistake
[2:07:11] Mauraderss: minimal time gated content totally deflated SOD
[2:07:13] craboskai: pepeLaugh oh no no no hes gonna see
[2:07:15] Snaketrap: wrath KEKL
[2:07:20] hiniku_hyena_martyr: the 20 man molten core got me demoralized, ngl

[2:07:29] wachupita: are those raiders or all?
[2:07:33] dirbagdan: OOF
[2:07:33] wavecadet: Alt raids
[2:07:37] Wingsofjanitor: SoD dead NODDERS
[2:07:38] snake_like: the gameplay is grinding supply boxes and gold capping for p3. I cba getting another 40, getting all the runes, doing gnomer, etc
[2:07:42] jordano111: the whole classic naming convention is so retarded, it only applies to the og game, anything after isn't classic
[2:07:46] iBanEvader: most people aren't raiding yet maybe
[2:07:47] Jay_rb: lvling from 25-40 is the problem with sod IMO
[2:07:51] andyjamesgames: cmon ironforge
[2:07:54] andyjamesgames: wtf
[2:07:54] icylemons1993: sstvPls
[2:08:13] MolokoMotive: its also 1 id every 7 days instead of 2.3 ids
[2:08:24] Bronloch: 40 takes a LOT longer for normies tho
[2:08:31] uzisd4: plot twist there is no data
[2:08:31] wavecadet: Yeah cant really compare it
[2:08:34] icylemons1993: Cheer100
[2:08:34] Slaanesh74: I agree, Snake_like. I'm not interested in leveling alts and getting those runes.
[2:08:36] jordano111: still higher population than D4 probably
[2:08:37] poggersshaman: dm the website owner on discord
[2:08:39] radassbadass69: Dont use that site for good pop data. I'm telling you there are way less alts now and 3/4 of my gnomer raids didnt have anyone logging. I play a to and am not counted in that population
[2:08:42] sweetleaf_: Yeah the mover is only level 32. Kappa
[2:08:48] OrsenXP: Watch the videos on 2x speed

[2:10:08] kalsizzle2: 40man raids are amazing......
[2:10:09] Slaanesh74: yeah, not into Gnomer
[2:10:12] TrumpWallWorker: 10 man raids are lame
[2:10:13] madgarlicjr: once you hit 30 there is tons of quests people do not have to spam sm dungeons that is fake news
[2:10:13] Randomguy_360: i dont think you can physically fit 20 people into gnomer
[2:10:14] eshonxv: 10 man is soy
[2:10:15] novvum: 10 man raids are dull af
[2:10:16] Jay_rb: Well the problem is questing takes you to STV which is on pvp watch half the time KEKW
[2:10:19] brainlagxd: 10 man raid with 3 day lockouts kinda soy
[2:10:19] feelsMorty: 10 man feels like  a dungeon
[2:10:26] cAdams10: i dont mess with 40 mans tbh too watered down. 20-25 is perfect imo
[2:10:27] ConorK1: makes it easier to find groups for usingthem to level
[2:10:34] Metaphix: do you think they did that because its easy to balance fights around?
[2:10:35] Bobiggums: 2 man raids would be cool
[2:10:35] Bronloch: 4 way 10 man gang bang raids
[2:10:46] earl_z_mode: WOW!

[2:12:23] cyonara74: is it just me or is horde on sod trash at wsg?
[2:12:33] madgarlicjr: i hate this thing he keeps saying about quests being inefficient, inefficient compared to what? lvling like a degen in a dungeon cleave spam group? im triggered
[2:12:40] Robbtuck: @cyonara74 yea big time
[2:12:43] Tonyromoisreal: @Metaphix sounds like it
[2:12:44] wavecadet: I farmed STV for my mount on my mage
[2:12:45] iBanEvader: me neither on my shaman lol
[2:12:47] iBanEvader: so lucky
[2:12:52] mrjollyvolly: Doing dungeons until 60 then doing 50-60 quests for gold was degenerate in classic
[2:12:53] Jay_rb: @Metaphix Yes, 25-40 is like 4x time than 1-25 for most people.
[2:12:56] Sourr09: yeah it’s just not worth it, didn’t buy it either
[2:12:56] wavecadet: didnt wanna spend 100
[2:12:59] snake_like: jfc chat. if they don't change anything "bliz isn't listening". if they change something "they're desperate". lol imagine being happy about something

[2:16:41] DuoX: i got characters in 3 guilds and thats the opinon of all of them.
[2:16:44] Jay_rb: Yes but the other raids are like half alts
[2:16:44] MolokoMotive: i made a guild with ~150 member so we just combine raids
[2:16:46] VenomVeinZ: my guild blows
[2:16:48] andyjamesgames: Filthy Casuals on Wild Growth. YEP
[2:16:48] Randomguy_360: nobody really wants to raid lead that though
[2:16:49] Robbtuck: yea it’s annoying af. feels like we are all in different guilds
[2:16:50] kalsizzle2: yeah its annoying and leaves ppl out fuck 10mans
[2:16:50] ferryojerryo: Yeah we have 5 or 6 raids groups
[2:16:52] Slaanesh74: a lot of guilds are just full of alts
[2:16:53] plaidshorts: yea 3 raid teams going on 4
[2:16:55] CygnusC: but they're raiding at different times, not at the same time
[2:16:57] madgarlicjr: Recruit you dogs
[2:16:57] Alildrunk: yeah we have 4 and are a smaller guild
[2:16:59] eshonxv: someone always steps up
[2:17:06] Jay_rb: The only way you could raid
[2:17:07] QuestFor420: 40man is the best
[2:17:07] snake_like: if they make a 40 man with gnomer level mechanics every dad will quit the game bro
[2:17:09] eshonxv: you take 40 ppl and 1 of them will be a leader ready to step up
[2:17:09] itsae__: I hated it :)
[2:17:10] DuoX: that wasn't season of dads
[2:17:10] xSupaSteve: dude stockades with that buff is gonna be insane

[2:17:19] YlaDaKilla: IMGONNACUM
[2:17:31] dirbagdan: That sounds like antisocial losers that dont weant to put the effort into a guild and wanna keep the solo style pug meta going
[2:17:31] fakenewsnoshoes: because of covid tho
[2:17:32] musu_magicalbridgestudios: Our guild is small and has 1 raid team so 20 man is achievable, 40 man means the guild will either fold or have to merge.
[2:17:46] wavecadet: @musu_magicalbridgestudios or recruit over the next 8 months?
[2:17:49] dirbagdan: Normalize pugs wiping for hours on raids again
[2:18:03] Atomized: just leave them a lone and make new raids.
[2:18:09] DuoX: at least half my guild is quitting when we get to 40s, loot just isn't fun with that many ppl

[2:18:33] craboskai: its just a number formula
[2:18:33] QuestFor420: MAKE SOMETHING NEWWW
[2:18:37] Randomguy_360: they can just leave the numbers unchanged and have it be a 20 man and it will be the same
[2:18:37] Freon_R134: the loot drama after having 10 man raids for a year will be epic
[2:18:39] andyjamesgames: oh that would be cool
[2:18:44] radassbadass69: FORCE RAG PHASE 2 OR WE RIOT

[2:19:17] Chernobyl26: @YlaDaKilla a lot of stuff
[2:19:20] fakenewsnoshoes: @Robbtuck the whole point of SOD is new shit tho i doubt people will care
[2:19:22] dirbagdan: @eshonxv This! The antisocial people should not be making decisions in a social game
[2:19:22] YlaDaKilla: @linkitcraig ah k that's cool
[2:19:22] novvum: Give us a new raid as well as crypts
[2:19:22] DuoX: give better gear than molten core 40 in a 5 man raid
[2:19:26] CygnusC: yes, new stuff pls

[2:42:08] cinx787: I want two pieces to drop from a boss with 89 other people in the raid.
[2:42:11] musu_magicalbridgestudios: Try looking at it from the perspective of someone who can't spend the majority of their day playing WoW and without the community to instantly have 39 other people ready to raid with them.
[2:42:14] Atomized: @StaysafeTV new world pvp FeelsGoodMan

[2:43:54] madgarlicjr: great poll mods are on their game
[2:43:55] radassbadass69: MC 20 man is okay, it's kind of boring whatever raid. BWL/AQ/NAX need to stay 40 man though

[2:44:28] andyjamesgames: i think there should be a 40 man option, where it gives more loot and more powerful loot. like they do in retail.
[2:44:29] shockmo: "don't  care" rise up!

[2:45:14] madgarlicjr: im a retard
[2:45:17] radassbadass69: I *prefer* 40 man MC but I understand why that one raid might get converted to 20 man. I am strongly against any other old raids being downsized
[2:45:18] JayPain: the memeing is hard right now craaazy xD
[2:45:18] Winky: Winky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! hello fellow gamer
[2:45:18] AceOfFlame: I think 40 mans being good are trash opinions :)
[2:45:20] andyjamesgames: we should get both options. 20 and 40 mans
[2:45:22] TesservcT: im also a retard
[2:45:27] cyonara74: my entire guild would quit sod
[2:45:27] joedestiny: I’m kind of new to the scene so 40 man seems hard to build a good squad if you aren’t in a guild

[2:45:41] joedestiny: found some good players for 10
[2:45:45] Atomized: @joedestiny the thing is, with vanilal 40 man raiding, you don't NEED a good squad, the content is easy.
[2:45:48] joedestiny: so 20 seems like easy
[2:45:59] joedestiny: oh got it
[2:46:00] Shredmuffn: 40man 3 loot drops going to officers cringe
[2:46:03] numblezzz: Aggrend is an arrogant fuckboy but atleast he shows passion and conviction. feels like a real wow dev even when he is wrong
[2:46:10] cinx787: Could do 20 and 40 man in the style of 10 and 25 where 25 man drops more loot.
[2:46:11] d3labeled: while theyre at it lets just throw in LFR cuz group form too hard for us :'(
[2:46:12] cutaway1: If they make MC a 20-man raid there is ZERO chance of BWL, AQ or Naxx being 40-man
[2:46:16] joedestiny: yea how does loot work for 40 in vanilla
[2:46:32] radassbadass69: @numblezzz agree, he's not perfect but for once the devs actually seem like "one of us"

[2:47:02] petjii: @Jay_rb indeed
[2:47:09] andyjamesgames: "temize well for as many different builds and playstyles as we are able to in the time we have." - THEN GIVE US DUAL SPEC. holy fuck.
[2:47:18] gamewatcher024: When does that phase come out anyways is there any talk of date
[2:47:22] madgarlicjr: don't even get started on pre classic pre raid gear
[2:47:24] jallaballan: they need to make shields like ice barrier scale and add better food and water lo

[2:53:14] Wrettchh: well wow had a good run
[2:53:16] photek_tn: @StaysafeTV Hi.
[2:53:18] Jay_rb: Any soda and pretzels gamers for a prime?
[2:53:20] DuoX: kalmidor is fine, its just eastern kingdoms , but it will stay down until twitch primes
[2:53:28] Atomized: I'll have my ready to go tomorrow Salute
[2:53:29] helmetnach0s: RIP WOW

[2:53:43] QuestFor420: yeah thats lame af
[2:53:43] boopbopbamski: 40m are the best
[2:53:44] SepeIio: leave them behind
[2:53:47] QuestFor420: For real
[2:53:52] numblezzz: why
[2:53:53] Jay_rb: and more loot
[2:53:56] Varels1: TOEP should not be available in 20man
[2:53:57] dirbagdan: YEP
[2:53:58] ChillyHTX: same items just higher ilvl
[2:54:00] DuoX: 20m best
[2:54:00] eshonxv: splitting the game up into 10 man, 20 man, 40 main is some cringe retail shit
[2:54:00] boopbopbamski: the idea "everyone should be able to do everything"
[2:54:09] mattbarz989: and win the roll
[2:54:10] numblezzz: so dealing with a bunch of retards means you should get better loot?
[2:54:11] Pwinzor: the retail team is developing SoD confirmed
[2:54:13] Salemanders: It does match the spirit of classic in terms of prep>mechanics
[2:54:20] gambleragain: well, good thing this is not vanilla
[2:54:22] DuoX: season of dads is gonna be dads
[2:54:26] derpthehjerp: This is why ERA is so crowded lately
[2:54:28] hxzcc: dinkDonk
[2:54:43] Varels1: 20 man raiding should have a gimped loot table & lesser stats to not dilute 40man raiding
[2:54:46] dankks31: imagine 17 warriors rolling need on cromies
[2:54:58] Jay_rb: Attempt
[2:55:18] numblezzz: i personally think better loot should be associated with difficulty, not carrying more spergs
[2:55:28] andyjamesgames: just give us dial spec
[2:55:33] andyjamesgames: dual
[2:55:34] ripwarlock2: Everyone just lived in AV
[2:55:34] JohnTannen: game servers fucked
[2:55:35] Salemanders: Expensive GFPPs
[2:55:38] madgarlicjr: som was carried by the HC adon
[2:55:44] dirbagdan: Season of Consumables
[2:55:46] iBanEvader: because it was not popula
[2:55:47] linkitcraig: soul of iron stole the spotlight
[2:55:49] iBanEvader: r
[2:55:52] fakenewsnoshoes: SoM was dead by BWL
[2:55:58] s33drop: phase two runes
[2:55:58] LeStone21: tbf no one was playing it
[2:56:06] Frank4LuLz: THEY WERE FIRING DEVS RIGHT
[2:56:09] DuoX: sod is only made to last until this summer though
[2:56:15] slanza613: SOM came out in the height of TBC which didnt help
[2:56:19] radassbadass69: I just gotta say I only didn't play SoM because I and many other had just got done playing vanilla for 2 years straight.
[2:56:21] linkitcraig: tmugsy was doing world first raids
[2:56:26] Varels1: the concept of "seasonal" wow realms feels plastic AF
[2:56:27] numblezzz: SoM was very unpopular, not a good example
[2:56:28] Slaanesh74: SoM was too soon
[2:56:29] dirbagdan: because som raiding required you to buy gold for consumes lol
[2:56:30] Salemanders: The baseline difficulty was higher for those raids though- less changing needed
[2:56:37] Scaleless1776: head bent over raised up posterior
[2:56:41] handpickedbytim: Clap good take
[2:56:45] iBanEvader: @Varels1 there's not enough new content
[2:56:46] Wrettchh: i watch a lot of WoW and i didnt watch any SoM after the hardcore peak
[2:56:56] realgypso: in the comments!
[2:57:15] jordano111: does obama play sod?
[2:57:26] dirbagdan: true
[2:57:30] scinvictus: is hardcore dead?
[2:57:31] Metaphix: ofc
[2:57:36] Axeman316: I hope SoD does die
[2:57:38] Slaanesh74: not to be a Debbie Downer, but SoD is not going to make it to 60
[2:57:40] madgarlicjr: this is to much doomer im not listening lalalalalala
[2:57:41] HiImLionel: when it hits lvl 60 and the games actually fully released there will be a good sized bump
[2:57:43] DuoX: people want more loot , they should literally double the loot on every boss in gnomer. Less ppl would quit.
[2:57:54] fakenewsnoshoes: @Axeman316 D:
[2:57:58] dirbagdan: @madgarlicjr good classic vibes only lol
[2:58:01] numblezzz: you made the same claims about player retention before p1 released
[2:58:10] johnnyhopkinwead1: damn i missed the start
[2:58:11] FormuoliPlays: thats me
[2:58:12] madgarlicjr: @dirbagdan LOLW
[2:58:22] johnnyhopkinwead1: isnt it some shit for all the people that spent all their gold on mount
[2:58:22] FormuoliPlays: literally is me right there
[2:58:29] jordano111: what do you think is more important, dungeons, new areas to level in, or kpop?
[2:58:31] themasher123: me
[2:58:34] TonyTwoTokes: Huh, seems odd to me to not want to experience new content as a classic andy
[2:58:35] Cashmere_kat: I'm only ever going to try SOD if they increase the nameplate distance
[2:58:37] Scaleless1776: level 60 Andy’s are cringe
[2:58:38] ccpom: are sod numbers bad?
[2:58:40] johnnyhopkinwead1: this news was to try and bring the game back to life now
[2:58:43] cravecrate: I am betting that most of the casual dad gamers will quit once 40 man raids come out
[2:58:55] fakenewsnoshoes: @ccpom more people than wotlk atleast
[2:59:04] numblezzz: i think thats a bit of extrapolation
[2:59:05] lshenanigansl: where else would people go wrath and retail are way worse
[2:59:07] squiiggleVision: bring back gdkp
[2:59:08] FormuoliPlays: @TonyTwoTokes hard for me to justify playing classic wrath, prepping for cata on a Private server, and classic wow, while also balancing life
[2:59:09] andyjamesgames: SoD end game needs to be good enough to get me to want to level all 8 classes to 60
[2:59:10] fleesyo: i level 6 toons to 25 in p1, i haven't even logged into p2
[2:59:14] jordano111: POG 2x xp wow
[2:59:17] musu_magicalbridgestudios: Open question, who is SOD aimed at?
[2:59:21] madgarlicjr: p1 had a lot of things going for it, ezier lvling, the holidays,
[2:59:23] Shredmuffn: ditch sod focus on cata :)
[2:59:28] DuoX: we are 4 runs in in my guild and no ones gotten a bis weapon. people want their weapon.
[2:59:31] Masterless: @fleesyo same idk why tho
[2:59:44] HeIlraiser_: ill be in contact :)
[2:59:45] dingusmalingussy: @fleesyo Same, and the people who have been away for a month all have 6 toons at 25.
[2:59:55] JohnTannen: clean it up jannies
[2:59:59] dirbagdan: "Sanitation Engineers"
[3:00:03] HiImLionel: all of the "essence" of vanilla is gone just nix it and wait for cata
[3:00:20] johnnyhopkinwead1: @musu_magicalbridgestudios they dont know. theyre throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks
[3:00:22] iBanEvader: why does it feel like Blizzard does no long term planning
[3:00:28] johnnyhopkinwead1: because they dont lol
[3:00:32] dirbagdan: lol
[3:00:41] johnnyhopkinwead1: wouldnt be surprised if its like 10 devs for all of SoD
[3:00:43] iBanEvader: @johnnyhopkinwead1 that's crazy if sop
[3:00:48] Pwinzor: that 10 week long phase 1 killed the hype/vibe for SoD
[3:00:50] numblezzz: this post gave a good sign of dev passion, the SoD devs have done well with raid design and gear itemization. doomers will doom
[3:00:51] fleesyo: @Masterless i think i just don't feel like grinding dungeons/gold
[3:00:52] t0rstin: Sounds like you need to make a wishlist and post it on X
[3:00:55] cAdams10: It’s gonna be longer for sure lol
[3:00:59] cAdams10: Almost confirmed I think
[3:01:05] madgarlicjr: @iBanEvader right?
[3:01:06] ferryojerryo: Bro im struggling to get to 40 lol
[3:01:08] okayyomi: The problem with catering to everyone is that the game can end up appealing to no one
[3:01:11] jameserush1: if what they said by mid point is true, phase 3 launches on april 4th
[3:01:13] akelatales: the propblem with sod is that it is a season and sooner or later the progress you did is lost in the classic normal server
[3:01:15] HeIlraiser_: the farm world is bigger than the raid world pepeLaugh
[3:01:26] musu_magicalbridgestudios: Well the post did say that next reset was around the midpoint, so that's like 3.5 weeks from launch. So a 7-8 week phase 2?
[3:01:26] lshenanigansl: it should go at least 2 more months
[3:01:27] JohnTannen: are the servers fucked
[3:01:29] Snaketrap: YEP out of ideas
[3:01:35] voreal22: Gnomer is not exciting, and the PvP zone is in the middle of the best leveling zone...... not good
[3:01:38] johnnyhopkinwead1: phase 1 lasted too long > takes too long for them to make changes >> takes too long to level alts in p2 >>> dead game
[3:01:38] Wingsofjanitor: HUH
[3:01:39] iBanEvader: yea it's all reactionary @AceKush8807
[3:01:41] dirbagdan: We are at the "mid-point" of P2. They literally said this in this blue post where they talk about XP buff
[3:01:43] jordano111: they give esfand a rotisserie chicken and he gives them answers
[3:01:58] johnnyhopkinwead1: common denominator for blizz = too little too late
[3:01:59] iBanEvader: yea it's all reactionary @StaysafeTV  they don't seem to plan long term which is weird imo

[3:03:04] the_do0d: -resist is the same as hit
[3:03:10] numblezzz: ^
[3:03:12] linkitcraig: what other trinket is there
[3:03:14] wavecadet: @the_do0d really?
[3:03:16] jameserush1: they dont get a trinket from pvp event
[3:03:20] akelatales: dont reveal the meta
[3:03:25] HiImLionel: chance to hit and chance to resist are completely different
[3:03:25] usebriefly: yeah it is
[3:03:26] linkitcraig: 5 spirit?
[3:03:28] madgarlicjr: its historically a pvp stat
[3:03:29] Atomized: It's not but it's still +damage
[3:03:33] gambleragain: its like spell pen
[3:03:34] endraga1: no it snot
[3:03:35] iBanEvader: it's not
[3:03:39] mattygisme: spell pen
[3:03:39] usebriefly: so why do they use it
[3:03:41] Kokesmella: the stamina because irradiated
[3:03:47] dirbagdan: hes thinking of weapon skill. weapon skill translates to hit
[3:03:53] wavecadet: @Kokesmella this is probably the reason
[3:03:53] lshenanigansl: theres no better option other then the thermaplugg one and ppl justt dont have it yet
[3:03:56] dirbagdan: thats why warriors use edgies
[3:04:01] madgarlicjr: Nerdge

[4:09:52] johnnyhopkinwead1: i get theyre experimenting but bruh this is a live product that customers are consuming.. STV is not acceptable in that form
[4:09:56] SuperLost89: they can do a zone pvp event and have ppl queue for it

[4:10:11] ripwarlock2: last 40 man was isle of conquest..

[4:20:36] dirbagdan: it's not that people were bad, it's that the game was still being figured out. It hadn't been min maxed like it was in classic. That happened mostly in the private server era. In classic 2006 it took three months to get to 4 horsemen.
