[1:01:25] Dipsie: First run Sindra monkaS
[1:01:26] HydnTV: alright, thats good! whats the official record time to beat?
[1:01:32] shanu91: I didn't tell it now that yesterday was not world record
[1:01:39] shanu91: i just asked for a message about yesterday's speedrun result
[1:01:46] aronfolmer: @HydnTV 49:34
[1:02:05] Dipsie: Nah very calm, prefer it over 4 healing in gdkps at this point
[1:02:17] Nightbot: Weekly highlights on my youtube-channel :D Make sure to subscribe :) http://www.youtube.com/prefoxfox?sub_confirmation=1
[1:03:12] milosam90: its kinda calming, you got 1 thing to care about and if raid dies not your problem you spam tank and move from some stuff and thats it
[1:03:34] Dipsie: Almost wanna see if 2 healing is possible at this point. Cause some bosses just die before mechanics at this point
[1:04:05] Dipsie: like festergut could in theory die before explosion in our run if we 2 healed instead of 3 healed
[1:04:17] Dipsie: and I think its doable if u swap around raid cd's
[1:05:13] shanu91: @Dipsie i noticed glob healing on sindra and was wondering who TF is 2nd tank if glob is healing
[1:05:20] aronfolmer: on Warmane we 0 heal putri and skip even the first transition ok
[1:05:24] shanu91: I didn't account for the possibility boss just dies before tank has to reset stacks KEKL
[1:05:52] Dipsie: @shanu91 Yeah people 1 tanked it on 0% even
[1:06:35] Dipsie: Being able to fully ignore spores is just a big dps gain so next week is very fun

[4:01:09] Snowsuki: thats a point actually, why not use the buff if the goal is to clear as many raids as possible?
[4:01:16] Snowsuki: it'd speed it up a lot
[4:01:52] merchant232: Ya, there is no negative to the buff so why would you not take it?

[7:17:07] Creoxx: dude prot war is googa
[7:17:11] Creoxx: even questing is super fast
[7:17:22] Creoxx: you can literally pull 5-10 mobs and zug
[7:17:26] Creoxx: and tanks have almost 0 queue
[7:17:31] smorc_the_weed: o fr Im not a huge fan of questing but love prot tanking
[7:17:35] smorc_the_weed: dope I’ll give it a go
[7:17:38] smorc_the_weed: Ty bb
[7:17:44] Creoxx: and its super fun too
[7:17:52] Creoxx: go revenge spec and your damage is bizarre
[7:18:12] smorc_the_weed: I tank spammed on my pally 1-80 but have no clue how long it took and now we got xp buff still ?
[7:18:15] smorc_the_weed: or is that gone
[7:18:20] Creoxx: yeah 170% exp now
[7:18:23] Creoxx: with buff and heirlooms
[7:18:30] pdfourtwenty: xddanse
[7:18:38] smorc_the_weed: Jesus okay yeah it’ll probably take a few days of going hard as hell
[7:19:18] Creoxx: yeah its really fast
[7:19:20] Creoxx: which is good imo
[7:19:42] smorc_the_weed: idk why but prot tanking seems fun to just have one do giga aoe damage with the ms spec
[7:19:44] smorc_the_weed: or whatever it is
[7:20:15] Creoxx: like 90% of your damage breakdown will be revenge if you go imp revenge spec and glyph
[7:20:19] Creoxx: but it slaps
[7:20:41] smorc_the_weed: ooo so I can go that or the ms build ? sorry for all the questions
[7:20:53] smorc_the_weed: I might just go imp revenge spec
[7:20:59] Creoxx: I honestly enjoyed full prot with the imp revenge more
[7:21:37] smorc_the_weed: dope one more questions is shockwave a fun cd to use ?
[7:22:31] Creoxx: eh its somewhat underwhelming compared to revenge and thunderclap but it hits semi hard and the stun is nice
