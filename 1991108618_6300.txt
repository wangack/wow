[4:29:09] Cubes4: You sort of have to know what you're doing to speed level as solo hunter
[4:29:13] ReyusX: i guess the safe part makes it much more appealing for HC
[4:29:17] sea_fishu: WCYD no frens

[4:29:28] karmaisrealpog: so solo is possible too on HC?
[4:29:29] ibentolunchbox: no Frenn sajj
[4:29:30] ceolinrob: world record 1 to 60 is like 20 hours on a mage, thats absurd

[4:29:48] FruityPunchZ: pocket chicken KEK

[4:30:01] naps250: no way that's solo
[4:30:01] sicparvismagna06: or ssf ?
[4:30:02] Cubes4: That mage record was getting a lot of help from friends
[4:30:02] nvpal: nah
[4:30:04] Alleleirauh: FeelsGoodMan soon AI will be good enough to play MMORPGs with POGGERS
[4:30:04] m3wk: No it's with dungeon boosting I believe
[4:30:07] Darth_Pantsu: COCKING
[4:30:08] Nightbot: Banned users will not be able to view stream anymore. Which means backseating = ban = no sing. Don't backseat
[4:30:09] hatsu58: SF
[4:30:17] ニューハーフ: it should be above 50 hours on release or so
[4:30:21] ニューハーフ: solo
[4:30:23] silver0scale: chat lying Susge
[4:30:28] nvpal: ban him KEKW
[4:30:28] Zycte_: @Alleleirauh but thats not a human Sadeg
[4:30:29] SnowballEOD: That guy ended up getting cancelled for some Ninja Looting in Classic KEK
[4:30:30] ceolinrob: @ニューハーフ it was with old dungeon mechanics, where exp was mostly from trash rather than bosses
[4:30:30] andima88: just WoWTime
[4:30:32] ReyusX: that sounds incorrect to me
[4:30:34] druid1000: I think those strats are a bit too risky for hc though KEK
[4:30:35] knarry: lmao, no way you can get to 60 with 20 hours solo
[4:30:35] karmaisrealpog: just spamming for 20 hours
[4:30:38] m3wk: I think solo runs WR are around 3-4 days
[4:30:43] Aluru1: 20 solo, the only help is warlocks summons if iirc
[4:30:46] Damathacus: Exp you get from kills gets split between party members. So with two man party you would need to double your leveling speed to get more exp/hour.
[4:30:46] xyphlok: Shirley chat is always correct
[4:30:46] elusiveleopard: 24 hours 8 minutes record
[4:30:46] noteworthynerd: Jokerd fastest solo time is like 3 days played lol, chat you so silly
[4:30:47] ニューハーフ: ceolinrob i mean if it was boosting after release, who cares
[4:30:51] DogeDrill: WoWTime ez
[4:30:55] andima88: 22h speedrun LosingMyMind
[4:30:56] Hnari: most likely maximizing rested XP?
[4:30:57] aslangajiev: What was Jokerd time?
[4:30:57] elimud: all of the other classes are grinding like plebs, meanwhile mages are farming 50 hyperspawns
[4:30:57] sicparvismagna06: why thats sounds wrong ? SF 20hours to 60 ?
[4:30:59] knarry: @noteworthynerd this lmao
[4:30:59] nvpal: one dc and its over KEKW
[4:31:08] Zhyren: probably not a hardcore thing when people do it but yet would mess up the time
[4:31:09] knarry: 20 hours is a ridiculous claim, unless some exploit or something
[4:31:10] elusiveleopard: SOLO world record is 74 hours @singsing
[4:31:10] Cubes4: For HC you would go safer aoe farm strats obviously, still very fast though
[4:31:16] Alleleirauh: @Zycte_ i fail to see the problem
[4:31:19] Matukaa: what is your /playtime mastah?
[4:31:27] ニューハーフ: noteworthynerd yeah and people beat joker time by like 10 hours or so
[4:31:30] SnowballEOD: That was on Classic where Frost Mage AOE was so strong, before the mob cap nerf and everything
[4:31:34] ニューハーフ: on hardcore release
[4:31:35] andima88: LosingMyMind
[4:31:37] MaaaaaaaN: 7 days 6 hrs I think Matukaa
[4:31:44] Hnari: solo aoe farming with pocket healer not in party?
[4:31:47] Alleleirauh: 20 hours SSF to 60? Yeah right Sure
[4:31:48] aslangajiev: @matukaa he was about 7 days+ morning
[4:31:52] naps250: only 40 more mobs Pog
[4:31:54] SnowballEOD: You could do 100 mobs in Blizzard and they all took same damage per tick instead of damage getting split between them.
[4:32:01] knarry: @Hnari yes, while also being ahead of the leveling curve on a fresh server

Like woodchucks, w0mbii are heavily built and virtually tailless burrowers with small eyes and short ears. w0mbii, however, are larger, measuring 80 to 120 cm (31 to 47 inches) long. Chiefly nocturnal and strictly herbivorous, they eat grasses and, in the case of the common w0mbii (Vombatus ursinus), the inner bark of tree and shrub roots.

[6:45:30] Alleleirauh: Corbenic (Carbone[c]k, Corbin) is the name of the Grail castle, the edifice housing the Holy Grail in Arthurian legend. It is a magical domain of the Grail keeper, often known as the Fisher King. The castle's descriptions vary greatly in different sources, and it first appears by that name in the Lancelot-Grail cycle where it is also the birthplace of Galahad.

[7:41:27] Sandap: DrSpookenstein I'm not touching that shit until reviews roll in. Owlcat makes good games but they're usually half broken on launch PepeLaf

[10:26:03] Reticent_88: @ertot1 On hardcore? No
[10:26:06] Qualdrion: From what I've seen on your AH gear is much more expensive while consumables seem less expensive, probably because usually everyone only needs 1 item each and they're done, but here people die after getting their items so you need more items
[10:26:07] deranked: @ertot1 its HC no pvp

[12:33:01] Shiva1080: Diablo 3 OMEGALOOOOL
[12:33:04] Khazmodan6: I just hope that it wont overwhelms you
[12:33:05] xyphlok: @Shiva1080 i mean basing new games you play on hype from others alone sometimes doesnt end well. So just go for what you want. If you wanna try out PoE because of the hype thats fine too
[12:33:25] Shiva1080: @xyphlok NOTED
[12:33:26] 与其成冠军不如成冠希: @Khazmodan6 i hope not haha happens to have a lot of free time until jan
[12:33:56] 与其成冠军不如成冠希: @Shiva1080 i am old FeelsOldMan
[12:34:14] Khazmodan6: Yeah, cus i think the most "intimidating" part is their skill tree... but its  actually not as complicated as it seems...
[12:34:28] 与其成冠军不如成冠希: @Khazmodan6 looking at it now lol
[12:34:53] Shiva1080: @Shiva1080 I was insane Diablo 2 player myself. I'm FeelsOldMan too. I just didn't like D3 at all.

[12:35:13] sdafkjwkop: yeah I went with own my build, but after checking 'high IQ meta builds' I realised I fucked up
[12:35:27] Khazmodan6: @apexgriefer its good to have a tunnel vision on your first run i think... so you can just pick a spell that you think is cool and just take things that supports it
[12:35:40] SupahBlah: KEK
[12:35:41] fausteliza: sameeeee
[12:35:45] tomsta123: same KEK
[12:35:46] KillerKid745: making a lab runner to sell gems yeeeeboi

[12:36:15] xyphlok: @Shiva1080  sad that the diablo "spin offs" are more "diablo" than current diablo will ever be now
[12:36:38] Shiva1080: @xyphlok True. D2 was my entire teenage.
[12:36:41] 与其成冠军不如成冠希: @Khazmodan6 thanks!  probably my first char to explore the game first
[12:37:08] killahmouse: there are also not many devs for poe 1
[12:37:08] xyphlok: passion for the game maybe
[12:37:09] Rockettdota: I think their working times are really terrible
[12:37:11] KillerKid745: sounds like a pretty full on dev team
[12:37:12] mittuot: Communal whipping session prob
[12:37:13] Rockettdota: Super long crunches
[12:37:15] Xozne: poe 2 closed beta is july
[12:37:18] MysticfulX: trap in the basement
[12:37:19] killahmouse: like 8 dudes or something made sanctum
[12:37:19] Protaine: probably one of the most efficient game companies
[12:37:20] Vakarcs_: Added like 50 new spell this league WTF
[12:37:21] reformedshackbeater: nah
[12:37:21] laki93: Afaik they are working on 2 separate leagues at the same time
[12:37:24] xyphlok: Workge
[12:37:25] St3v3nson: yeah
[12:37:25] chopachops1: They have several teams working separately on leagues
[12:37:27] Khazmodan6: @apexgriefer really hope that it suits you, cus it really is a fantastic game if you have time... good luck have fun!
[12:37:35] KillerKid745: the wheel of pleasure you mean
[12:37:37] 与其成冠军不如成冠希: @Khazmodan6 <3
[12:37:38] chopachops1: They also use a lot of assets made ahead
[12:37:41] laki93: so it's basically 6-8 month timespan
[12:37:45] zooyrk2: run their team like mappa
[12:37:50] rfr0zen: The way they designed the game allows them to do it tho... really good game code ... makes probably creating new stuff a lot easier
[12:37:51] limbomon: They are still a small company Unlike the big gaming giants.
[12:37:52] mr_madkeks: rip standart kek
[12:38:02] Protaine: and GGG's internal infrastructure is developed by themselves, so hyper efficient
