[1:44:48] Moobot: https://www.twitch.tv/whaazz/clip/JazzyUnusualJalapenoEagleEye-idkWIYFZo54OaUnC
[1:44:59] Phae__: @5tarchild If you get a conquest piece from vault and then convert it to tier, yes, it'll scale to 489 in PvP, but that's also true for the conquest pieces you just buy. In short, however you get conquest gear and convert it to tier, it'll still scale to 489. If you also just get tier in the PvP slots of the vault, then yes, it'll also scale to 489. It'll say on the piece itself if it scales or not.

[2:03:25] Meffesto: is this sp or i have hallucinations ?
[2:03:32] jdot117: isnt it always better to use cds and not die even if you overlap? the other team will probably overlap too in shuffle right?
[2:04:13] runnesvoid: @jdot117 sure but if you overlap everytime you will loose anyway
[2:04:13] Moobot: My first vlog ever! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E690kmX6HJc
[2:04:59] Nalaa_3: i never thought we would see whaazzabi again
[2:05:00] jdot117: @runnesvoid yeah i get that but most likely you will not overlap every single time, especially if you react early and quick
[2:05:04] Nalaa_3: what a blessing
[2:05:26] M4dmanGG: what's your fear macro?
[2:05:43] Naaay: ok ty @Whaazz and congrats on the win. well deserved
[2:05:45] Pexxal: why no whaazzdragon?
[2:05:46] runnesvoid: @jdot117 i  think its truer the more you approach lower rating, so the higher rating the overlap is worse
[2:06:27] magnusz: dazed rly good at warrior too tbh
[2:06:30] jdot117: yes for sure cocoon into disperse is bad, but its shuffle you just do what you can and hope for the best i guess

[2:33:24] phantomhunterxz: you need to honest on Jaime even if he is your guy
[2:33:27] Matzefyr: tbf, is it really cheating to use bots in arena? I use bots because I find it more fun and comfortable for me to play this way. Blizzard hasn't banned me, so is it really against the rules?

[2:42:55] jaime: naga buttons are by far the best
[2:42:56] jaime: no contest
[2:42:57] ladidaada: What are your mouse damage binds on the mouse then? You use a MMO mouse?
[2:43:01] Asake2K: What mouse buttons do you use for dmg? 4/5? Or wheel
[2:43:05] crucybletv: i use F for kick on every class
[2:43:06] jaime: or mouse in general
[2:43:11] alegpetrovich: @jaime on what u have?
[2:43:11] sind233: i just got dispeled 40-50 times in shuffle and couldnt win against dh
[2:43:13] sind233: IM so tilted
[2:43:17] jaime: naga
[2:43:21] Raikubest: Trust jaime @Whaazz he knows the best what keybind is the best Kappa

[2:43:28] SexiestChatter: @sind233 l2p
[2:43:28] Explicitiz: Z is rly good with wasd movement

[2:43:39] DCBen: @jaime what is your kickbind?
[2:43:41] emergence_fi: do u think mousewheel is bad for kick though?
[2:43:43] bigclub666: my naga still working since 10 years
[2:43:45] jaime: @raiku dh needs to rebind..
[2:43:49] sind233: @SexiestChatter idd
[2:43:56] Raikubest: i got 77% jaime chan is only 2% ahead
[2:43:57] sind233: @SexiestChatter think thats the issue too
[2:43:59] Raikubest: whaz is 61%...
[2:43:59] nonestopqsx: shift scrolls for counterffectives / purges or mousebutton up/down, is good hand for such too yy
[2:44:04] zaigodmodex: some ppl kick without having it on their bars
[2:44:14] selles21: best bin is mousewheel to turn bot on and off kappa
[2:44:14] Moobot: Anyone who gifts 5 Subscribers can choose a Spec of my "Geared Classes" to play in Shuffle until the next person gifts 5 Subs.

[2:44:23] Matzefyr: 61% but isnt whazz rank 1? if i was rank 1 i would have kick rate of 100% or upwards
[2:44:28] trixbunneh565: imagine playing with arrow keys/numpad kek
[2:44:31] phantomhunterxz: kick on 5 with 3 mod (shift/ctrl/alt) for arena 1/2/3 works well for me
[2:44:40] jaime: Kappa
[2:44:43] Raikubest: jaime would get instant banned then... jaime 307 kicks used 305 landed...
[2:44:47] Deathmarkedx: how tf do u press alt 5
[2:45:01] Chrizirl: samiyam has like 80% in boomie, curious how that works with beam

[2:45:38] DariusHDM: @Deathmarkedx how tf does he press c+Y/U
[2:45:39] OptiTV_: raiku came from gym and chose violence
[2:45:42] phantomhunterxz: @Deathmarkedx use 2 hands ofc
[2:45:51] Zlr_tv: Doesn't chan miss kick intentionally alot too when he chooses to blanket?
[2:45:59] Deathmarkedx: ctrl Y sounds 10 times more reasonable than alt 5
[2:46:06] bigclub666: y is right by ctrl...
[2:46:08] Captainpikaboo: :D
[2:46:08] bdobbi: i buy it
[2:46:13] Chrizirl: ah yes the treants kick, game changer LUL
[2:46:16] Deathmarkedx: i cant ever imagine pressing anything on alt 5 let alone kick that has to be as fast as possible
[2:46:17] Loadedmvp: i dont believe you kicked a Tren LUL
[2:46:32] AsdOfc: @zlr_tv there is no blanket on retail
[2:46:34] zaigodmodex: i kick treans irl
[2:46:40] Raikubest: Sure bro the chaosbolt lands on us
[2:46:46] Raikubest: "i kicked the treant"

[2:47:42] alegpetrovich: @Whaazz raiku had a oneshotter  ele in shuffle he was kicking aloot of lava bursts:p
[2:47:53] Raikubest: u shoulda watched my lobby on stream yesterday, i played vs 1 shot ele, i obv saw he casted with skyfury up and i stopped everycast and then he said" its good to know u have a brain mage" then on my team he 1 shot them KEKW
[2:48:01] LyusinatoR: actually boomkins are one of the casters with more casting time
[2:48:12] phantomhunterxz: @Deathmarkedx a have like 12 binds on alt so i get used to
[2:48:15] spiderlegs101: you used a 2min cd to make your lavaburst instant
[2:48:15] Deathmarkedx: cata ele was the lightning bolt with the glyph to cast while moving no?
[2:48:16] Guelag: MOP Ele was 100% dot and lavaburst proc
[2:48:51] DCBen: Just make a weakaura
[2:49:10] ilillilllillllill: recombobulation
[2:49:17] OptiTV_: because it's awful design to keep same icon and everything but just change duration

[2:57:32] de_dude: blame raiku
[2:57:35] Schwenkyytv: its an wa for HPS on that target
[2:58:32] xtpwow: Nice that liquid got karma with that 2v3 haha
[2:58:51] Phae__: The fact that 2 people can die, and it doesn't give both sides a win or draw is weird.

[3:11:57] CalyOG: its the best
[3:12:05] Feroxita1337: i hate the set bonus

[3:24:58] bigclub666: oh wait, new season=new conq gear yeah?
[3:25:03] bigclub666: i should hoard points
[3:25:24] Phae__: @nehis_97 Historically, yes, but they have not been during DF for w/e reason
[3:25:27] Kradzer: @bigclub666 conquest is deleted between seasons :D
[3:25:52] laki_svk: so how this steal haste works ?
[3:25:52] Phae__: Conquest is deleted though, yes, and cap resets at beginning of new season
[3:26:03] bigclub666: honor=not deleted, conq=deleted? oh
[3:26:08] Phae__: Yes
[3:26:16] Phae__: Though honor has been deleted in previous xpacs as well
[3:26:17] bigclub666: gotcha
[3:26:26] lordofserenity: these games harder than awc cross region tournament
[3:26:34] Myralk: Yo Wazz, you should make a targetoftarget macro for Leap of Faith so you dont have to manually go and target the person you want to grip

[3:26:57] nehis_97: @phae__ yea that's I was confused bcs I remember it being deleted but didn't feel like previous season. So weren't sure. Thx
[3:27:22] Phae__: Yep, no problem. Feels nice not to have it deleted right now, but definitely odd compared to before.
[3:28:15] nehis_97: I love it not being deleted. Bcs I can get honor ready for all my ALTs  now when it's easy
[3:28:27] nehis_97: And increased

[3:36:13] Esotraz: i agree matze
[3:36:14] uninspire: ur joking matz
[3:36:30] fanny_peak: DH Mega shit, just look at this melee class called Assassination rogue

[3:38:20] sxxicute: @matzefyr maybe not on 1800, but clearly DH is the strongest melee by far when it comes to raw damage and pressure. U can just tell through awc/mid-season clash. It’s overrepresented by far comparred to other classes
[3:38:22] AMNZ7: kinda crazy u know me as stream sniper oscar
