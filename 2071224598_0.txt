[0:29:36] Xail_EU: @sn4qz KEKW
[0:29:41] hackiii: then its not the ntg2 ?
[0:29:44] Tephaine: would never happen
[0:30:07] Sebleh: can’t you just check where you bought it which mic it is?
[0:30:16] Sebleh: like Amazon order history or your email etc
[0:31:35] applefactory: that a Focusrite interface?
[0:31:43] Tephaine: just buy 2 of every cable on offer. 1 for now 1 for spare
[0:31:52] Kuroz: yes, it's focusrite
[0:31:59] Sebleh: she shit talked Italian bread to her friends while drinking
[0:31:59] hackiii: it says in the faq it has autosensing, which means it can detect if you have an TRS or TRRS input connection
[0:32:22] hackiii: so the shown amazon trs 2 xlr adapter cable should work
[0:32:23] Jens_JBMedia: small Klinke means the small 3.5mm plug ^^
[0:32:28] Jens_JBMedia: and Hi ^^
[0:32:29] faulen: did you not want to use USB? Because you could use a USB to XLR cable.
[0:32:46] faulen: gotcha
[0:33:09] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[0:33:10] applefactory: you really want to be using TRRS if you have a headphone mic
[0:33:11] Sebleh: shit. birthday dinner on Saturday then.
[0:33:18] Sebleh: set it up. call up the friends.
[0:33:20] SeanZeroLoL: do you just keep a banana there for scale?

[0:33:28] Sebleh: happy birthday
[0:33:31] applefactory: extra ring
[0:33:31] hackiii: more rings
[0:33:36] ON_RADAR: life has been great
[0:33:38] applefactory: so mic and audio
[0:33:41] Tephaine: birthday banana time
[0:33:45] ole955: Your headset looks like giant airpods :D
[0:33:46] applefactory: TRS =audio only
[0:33:51] applefactory: TRRS = mic and audio
[0:33:53] Jens_JBMedia: TRRS means: 3 rings on the plug simply mean that 2 are for stereo output and one for mic
[0:33:56] laserlats: GET IT DOWN!!! pretend that banana is a boss fight
[0:33:56] faulen: Are you sure that the TRS output on your mic is not just for Monitoring?
[0:33:58] applefactory: from the same cable
[0:34:21] applefactory: if you have an external mic it doesn't matetr
[0:34:31] Coldfare: trs = left, right, ground. trrs = left, right, ground, mic
[0:35:08] Sebleh: fuck I modified the birthday copypasta and lost it
[0:35:13] Sebleh: seblehDepresso
[0:35:13] TotallyNotRaien: im just pretending to understand all this tech talk and nodding along
[0:35:18] applefactory: if you have a headset with a mic built in, then you need TRRS, if you have an external mic it doesn't matter
[0:35:20] Tephaine: so italian banana good italian bread rubbish?
[0:35:33] hackiii: guys, its about a single shotgun mic
[0:35:34] hackiii: no headset
[0:35:49] faulen: Are you sure that the TRS output on your mic is not just for Monitoring?
[0:35:50] applefactory: then TRS is fine
[0:35:54] laserlats: That banana never stood a chance
[0:36:06] Aegatron: looked scary yesterday! youre such a adventurer now Caro
[0:36:06] hackiii: @Naguura TRS has 2 signal lines, TRRS has 3 signal lines - in my opinion it doesnt matter you can use the TRS 2 XLR adapters
[0:36:17] applefactory: you can monitor separately through the mixer
[0:36:21] Kuroz: pleasedontbanmemen having fun on youtube hmmMeeting
[0:36:30] applefactory: there's a monitor input for headphones
[0:36:56] applefactory: Focusrite boxes have a headphone ajack input with thtier own minotiring level
[0:37:03] applefactory: wow, typos...
[0:37:15] Sebleh: naguura as an audio’d engineer (an engineer with audio not an audio engineer) my expert experience from an anecdote my friend told me about his mom’s friend’s cousin’s daughter it’s your apartment that’s interfering with the microphone signal to your headset through the kitchen lights. you need to just move to fix it.

[1:25:35] TotallyNotRaien: f for me
[1:26:08] TiliaTV: hello
[1:26:22] Sebleh: Poggies I'm excited to see Rook cast
[1:26:29] kaverrr: Bolstering is such a good affix. I love watching Ret Pala Divine Storm all the Dreadpetals in Everbloom and bolster all the prio targets. Wish we could have bolstering every week!
[1:26:38] TiliaTV: I want to try a caster spec. normally I 'm rogue main so can you suggest me , I'm between fire/arcane mage , Destro warlock
[1:27:01] TotallyNotRaien: why is bolstering always on fortified weeks
[1:27:04] Sebleh: At least friday is a shorter day
[1:27:04] Kuroz: today ends earlier
[1:27:20] Blightrose: gonna be rough for Boomer naguura, used to bedtime by 9

[1:27:42] kaverrr: Old people schedule
[1:27:43] plirbo: I  am probably in the minority, but I actually like the occasional hard or tricky affix and I think the dumbing down of affixes has made wow less interesting.
[1:27:53] Sebleh: lmao naguura sleeping before midnight on a day off
[1:28:01] Sebleh: That never happens.
[1:28:44] Tephaine: naguura just wanna sneak over to the blue House for partying.
[1:30:52] HOTALOT25: aloo friends whats up
[1:30:58] Eltved3: just noticed, naguura going for that beige look
[1:31:32] TotallyNotRaien: she looks like a billionaire in lounge wear
[1:32:27] Xastin3: ready for more no healer Despairge. I really hope blizzard fixes healing in WW
[1:32:54] ZephyrinDark: bleh

[1:33:16] Xastin3: im not that excel savy
[1:33:22] Sebleh: You copy the entire cell and paste only the cell format
[1:33:36] Sebleh: Oh IDK then
[1:33:45] Tephaine: thats not Excel so i dunno
[1:33:48] myguyhood: the button next to 100% maybe?
[1:33:50] plirbo: Btw, what is the story with Dratnos' tooth? Who of the casters did he fight?
[1:33:56] Sebleh: Does the color selection tool have an option to pick a color with the sampler thing?
[1:34:06] ZephyrinDark: I don't think healers should be necessary on low keys like in the MDI, however, they can make it so that there are affixes like rot damage or something that makes you have to play with a healer
[1:34:14] yenny__: where is the one with the script for who wins?
[1:34:15] kaverrr: Why are there no healers on the caster team for MDI? Are they just too annoying?
[1:34:20] TotallyNotRaien: @plirbo i believe he said it fell off and that he has always had bad teeth
[1:34:23] Xastin3: i mean its not excel but it pretty has same rules as excel doesn it?
[1:34:29] Sebleh: @plirbo Officially, tooth was dead for years and he bit a piece of bread that snapped it. Unofficially, he got in a street fight with a gang of moonkins and taunted them telling them to bear form so he took a wing to the face.
[1:34:38] Tephaine: healers are not real. they all died last week
[1:34:53] plirbo: The moonkin story makes a bit of sense.
[1:35:07] Xastin3: people did keys last week? i didnt even fill my vault on healer
[1:35:17] Xastin3: i think i did 4 keys and said f it
[1:35:17] Tephaine: @xastin3  no idea. i assume so.
[1:35:49] Tephaine: also its in german so im doomed
[1:36:07] Xendera5: hey @naguura hey Chat
[1:36:11] Xastin3: im kinda at point this season where waiting for next season. i dont really want to push anymore.
[1:36:21] Sebleh: @Xastin3 last week had decent affixes
[1:36:44] Xendera5: du kannst bei benuzerdeciniert den Pinsel nutzen für die gleiche Farbe
[1:36:56] rawrr009: when is next season?
[1:37:07] Blightrose: who is top seed for group b ?
[1:37:18] Xastin3: next season just regearing and hopefully some balance
[1:37:34] Xastin3: fingers crossed on balance

[1:39:18] Pejsik_CZ: Do u speak german or english better ?
[1:39:29] real_dodo_: Mandatory vs perplexed this weekend woohoo
[1:40:43] Luk777ls: so last hope is the last hope again KEKW
[1:40:46] Blightrose: so there are hardly any NA teams at all this MDI ?
[1:40:50] Xastin3: isnt there only 1 us team in entire mdi?
[1:40:52] Sebleh: YEP NA’s last hope is literally Last Hope
[1:40:57] Xastin3: i thought was just dorki's team
[1:41:04] Xendera5: is NA not so good in M+?
[1:41:19] wpprrz: EU > NA
[1:41:27] Klara: yessss mandatory ftw
[1:41:28] Blightrose: @Xendera5 I guess with team ambition not existing anymore I guess so
[1:41:29] Sebleh: perplexed has a similar Drjay curse
[1:41:30] Klara: klaraStonks
[1:41:36] Tephaine: Think na casters is last hope.
[1:41:44] Stovepov: that’s it
[1:41:55] Luk777ls: mandatory perpelxed bald bandits sloth
[1:41:56] Sebleh: eclipse seems strong
[1:41:58] majestictaco0: bolstering throne monkaS
[1:41:59] crudolol: @Xendera5 NA generally not so good in competetive games. no idea why, but its like that in most of games lul
[1:42:01] muonz: @Klara klaraVibe
[1:42:08] kaverrr: Was it because of a Blizzard rule that NAs Last Hope had to change name?

[1:44:07] valisha007: How good you see Kush's Team ?
[1:44:07] beautymustdie1: how good is fragnance team
[1:44:17] Sebleh: Perplexed has more mdi experience though no? they have a better chance even if eclipsed is stacked
[1:44:19] jwillhue: complex is relative cause they don’t kick in +5
[1:44:26] Tephaine: no the cable to recharge your headset
[1:44:34] Andersonmps: Oh, right. Hows the camera going? Did you tested it?
[1:44:50] Sebleh: she’s always had the headset cable @tephaine

[1:47:54] Aratos: hello all :)
[1:47:54] chaarp: top 4 teams have some really strong players this weekend
[1:48:13] markhound: naguura
[1:48:15] Aratos: so excited to see Perplexed perform today
[1:48:18] markhound: TTours
[1:48:33] MrDiscen: Are Echo playing today guys?
[1:48:48] wpprrz: @MrDiscen no
[1:48:50] Tephaine: nope
[1:48:56] Aratos: they were just 14 sec. behind Echo in the Time Trials
[1:49:09] wpprrz: Its Group B today/this weekend
[1:49:36] markhound: SingsMic
[1:50:17] Sebleh: that makes no sense. same affixes but different levels?
[1:50:20] Zir_aus: are we assuming the guys didnt hold back tech
[1:51:17] markhound: xd
[1:51:20] Naadd_: Heyo !
[1:51:23] SenorTostada: Dawgs was really good last week. Rooting for them as the... under... dawgs
[1:52:20] marsagoxd: bolstering needs to go
[1:52:22] Xastin3: or they play chicken banning it
[1:52:25] Xastin3: and it makes it through
[1:53:09] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[1:53:10] Xastin3: ad fort will be faster for sure
[1:53:23] SenorTostada: 100%
[1:54:11] Xastin3: LUL
[1:54:15] Nnoggie: MDI in SL when every map was 25min
[1:54:16] nevernude1: good morning/afternoon everyone!
[1:54:17] Sebleh: fort ad would make the juggernauts REALLY deadly
[1:54:17] Xastin3: Rise is awful dungeon
[1:54:19] Nnoggie: peepoSleep
[1:54:29] real_dodo_: Portal skip was genius
[1:54:36] Xastin3: if rise somehow got deleted from the game files... no one would shed a tear
[1:54:38] Sebleh: @nnoggie wdym DoS was such a fun dungeon to watch parkeCringe
[1:54:40] SenorTostada: Was about to say: the novelty of the portal technique is gone now, so let's just skip it
[1:54:46] markhound: OSFrog
[1:56:02] mejiro151: I long for an MDI where you can use the same spec more than once per best of 3
[1:56:06] yenny__: forced RP dungeons are just so fcking slow Bedge
[1:56:11] Sebleh: honestly even without mdi long dungeons are just boring
[1:56:16] markhound: xd
[1:56:20] markhound: FrankerZ
[1:56:27] Tephaine: which is why i prefer tgp over mdi
[1:57:18] Xastin3: be funny if team could ban classes from dungeon
[1:57:27] Xastin3: so they had to play off meta stuff
[1:57:31] Kuroz: not really that important

[1:57:39] TotallyNotRaien: that would be shitty for the teams tho
[1:57:46] SenorTostada: If it's not comparable it's hardly worth it yea
[1:57:48] TotallyNotRaien: all the time needed to prepare would double or triple
[1:58:40] Nnoggie: like hotswapping relics mid dungeon @Naguura diry exploiter
[1:58:45] Xastin3: mdi just isnt realistic and it stops tuning in live game.
[1:58:46] markhound: SingsNote PartyTime PartyTime
[1:58:47] TotallyNotRaien: should it be a free for all instead of brackets?
[1:59:27] plirbo: I looked at the times last week, and some teams improved 1-2 minutes the second and third time they did a dungeon.
[1:59:32] Blightrose: on the other hand, TGP is boring for the first 2 hours of each day because the keys are psis easy for the teams
[1:59:38] Xastin3: like mdi was cool for a week or two but not were going on week three or four and there been no more balance which makes playing live kinda lame.
[1:59:49] Nnoggie: last stand was awful imo
[1:59:57] Nnoggie: glad it's gone
[1:59:59] looya: what was Last stand?
[2:00:01] Sebleh: that’s why I think 10 dungeons would be a bit better. yeah it would suck to have two more dungeons to practice, but it’s a bit more variety.
[2:00:02] SenorTostada: Strategies are very similar, times are too, it's hard to hype it 10 times in a row. That's what made Legendary a breath of fresh air for doing weird stuff too, same with the Portal tech (once).
[2:00:08] Sebleh: last stand was kinda ass
[2:00:20] Nnoggie: i wanted to costream
[2:00:21] Tephaine: day 1 of tgp Can be meh but day 2 and 3 is great
[2:00:23] Nnoggie: turned off after 30m
[2:00:50] plirbo: What would the team think about pushing more randomness on them? Would they refuse?
[2:00:56] Sebleh: last stand is basically live time trials for mdi
[2:01:06] looya: ah right yeah i remember
[2:01:08] markhound: FrankerZ TTours
[2:01:15] markhound: CorgiDerp
[2:01:37] Xastin3: the end of last stand was kinda cool.
[2:01:40] Nnoggie: do you have more spreadsheets for me to steal TTours
[2:01:45] Xastin3: but most of it was lame
[2:01:53] OlvedenN: @Naguura What do you think of Classic WOW speedrunning compared to the MDI format?
[2:02:01] galdrelvolkfire: Are you commentating today?
[2:02:09] StreamElements: Join Naguura on her journey to become the most casual of transmog farmers!

[2:02:12] Sebleh: in the last stand if you’re 2 seconds behind you just restart because finishing doesn’t matter at that point
[2:02:14] Kuroz: @galdrelvolkfire she is
[2:02:22] kwekie: hi hi hi
[2:02:24] OlvedenN: We speedrun raids yeah
[2:02:27] galdrelvolkfire: good:)
[2:02:58] plirbo: I just want access to it so I can fix the document title.
[2:03:04] Nnoggie: it was mostly raids, was actually a lot of competition in wrath, they even mapped the raid for MDT @Naguura because WCL made "count" requirements
[2:03:05] Kaelangg: why does this remix give lana a lisp?
[2:03:09] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:03:27] Tephaine: yes doc title is mildy triggering
[2:03:28] dnfbowser: who is your favorite in group B Naguura
[2:03:45] Sebleh: can you send it to me too? plskthx
[2:03:48] Kuroz: !pieces
[2:03:48] StreamElements: Around 10,000 B.C. humans invented the slinger, to allow them to throw objects even harder. Around 400 B.C. humans invented the catapult, which allowed them to throw objects even harder. In 1958 they invented the ICBM, which allowed people to blast objects about anywhere on the planet. Since then the evolution of throwing things has mostly been halted, until 2021 when a guild called Pieces invented a way to throw RaidMasters harder than was previously imagined possible.
[2:03:54] Sebleh: Kappa for legal reasons
[2:04:05] markhound: xd
[2:04:25] razen_95: we had a raid race once. echo vs. limit in bfa last race. was for charity
[2:04:57] razen_95: *last raid
[2:05:13] MC_Sotarkadin: I remember one of the blizzcons they did one, for Firelands where they got rid of all trash and it was just about clearing the bosses
[2:05:15] markhound: RalpherZ
[2:05:20] markhound: OSFrog
[2:05:27] markhound: ChefFrank
[2:05:33] OlvedenN: Outside of Ulduar & Black Temple, all raid speedruns have been below 40min by the end. But no idea how Retail raids are :/
[2:06:03] Tephaine: fix doc title?
[2:06:30] dnfbowser: throne most likely
[2:06:31] Kuroz: does the title matter? it's not a public doc
[2:06:37] Kuroz: hmmMeeting
[2:06:40] Mrh4wkn: Hi Caro Hi Chat naguuraLove
[2:06:42] dnfbowser: brh
[2:06:43] markhound: PartyHat
[2:06:44] dnfbowser: maybe
[2:07:00] dnfbowser: faging forti in brh is rlly hard
[2:07:04] SenorTostada: WCM might be ass too. as always
[2:07:28] Nnoggie: hm just had a thought, what if the affixes were like this on live servers
[2:07:37] Nnoggie: no same for all keys but different per dungeon

[2:07:41] dnfbowser: rise can be anoying first platform
[2:07:56] Xastin3: I think rise is permban
[2:08:12] kaynwow: @Nnoggie imagine being able to play 2/8 dungeons per week
[2:09:02] Xastin3: there be so many dead keys each week
[2:09:07] Xastin3: people refuse play certain affixes
[2:09:21] Nnoggie: well whats better dead dungeons or dead weeks
[2:09:34] Nnoggie: nah still switching ofc
[2:09:44] Nnoggie: but it kinda messes with the key system
[2:09:52] nevernude1: @naguura have you reacted to Valkyrae and Fuslies new song?
[2:09:54] Nnoggie: idk, just an idea
[2:10:39] TotallyNotRaien: i would also be pretty bad for new players getting into M+ affixes not being stable
[2:10:52] kaynwow: best change would be to make affixes and affix combos playable so you wouldnt have dead weeks
[2:11:08] Nnoggie: think they gonna remove one affix for sure next expansion, one of the interviews hinted at it
[2:11:15] kaynwow: bolstering being still a thing is just criminal
[2:11:16] cptdrage: like a +18 is harder than a +21 normally
[2:11:26] Xastin3: +18 definitely harder then 21
[2:11:47] Xastin3: dps dont kick or stop anything
[2:11:48] chaarp: it's funny with bolstering. it's infinitely better than it used to be, but still so shit
[2:11:53] muonz: @kaynwow lifevsBinocs
[2:12:02] kaynwow: @muonz kaynwoBinocs
[2:12:19] Nnoggie: its definitely weird that the loot is completely meaningless for higher end
[2:12:31] Nnoggie: but the main thing people care about in lower keys
[2:12:39] Xastin3: They should bring back challange modes let it be rating mode. Then scale M+ to +25 for loot.
[2:12:48] markhound: xd
[2:13:09] StreamElements: For Highlights, fun content and guides, remember to subscribe to my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/naguura
[2:13:12] markhound: TTours
[2:13:37] galdrelvolkfire: naguuraHypers
[2:13:39] Xastin3: they also need redesign m+ to be less about affixes but make it more about hard dungeons with more designed encounters. Bring back attrition type healing. Less about 1 shots.
[2:14:06] nevernude1: Don’t forget to tell them we said hello and hope they have a good day
[2:15:02] Sebleh: I think they should make a separate M+ version of dungeons that has less obscenely long paths, no weird puzzle shit that depends on ms, and little to no RP. or at least the M0 version should be that and normal/heroic can be as annoying as they want it to be.
[2:15:18] Sebleh: Yes tell them chat says hi Waiting
[2:15:24] galdrelvolkfire: @Sebleh They did, Follower Dungeons lmao
[2:15:26] Sebleh: Franzi Pog
[2:15:32] Sebleh: the floor?
[2:15:35] galdrelvolkfire: Nice flooring
[2:15:40] plirbo: Samples
[2:15:41] Sebleh: it’s called a sample not an example
[2:15:46] SenorTostada: Floorologist xD
[2:15:50] Xastin3: flower lady called?
[2:15:56] sim967: looks nice
[2:15:56] Kuroz: floor
[2:15:57] Sebleh: Yeah it’s fine
[2:15:58] SenorTostada: Looks nice
[2:15:58] Tephaine: floor inspector?
[2:15:58] cptdrage: that is amazing
[2:16:00] galdrelvolkfire: I think it looks great actually 9
[2:16:03] RigelOrionis: looks good
[2:16:06] Yedblue: Visgraat! 10/10!
[2:16:08] SenorTostada: 13/10 would buy again
[2:16:09] shexchoklad: Looks like, floor
[2:16:11] nevernude1: 7.5
[2:16:12] Healarity: 10
[2:16:12] sim967: 8
[2:16:13] razen_95: 9,5
[2:16:13] chaarp: it's a nice floor, but i prefer the ones you don't have to carry around
[2:16:14] Tephaine: seems abit Dark?
[2:16:17] mika01: 8
[2:16:21] Sebleh: you know at this angle I can’t tell if you’re holding up the floor sample or hugging it to pose like your moonkin in game
[2:16:21] razen_95: Oak
[2:16:23] Luk777ls: oak
[2:16:24] SenorTostada: Oak
[2:16:25] deherculesgod: nice wood
[2:16:26] wpprrz: its okay
[2:16:26] plirbo: Looks very good. Could be too dark if the room is dark.
[2:16:26] galdrelvolkfire: Oak
[2:16:34] galdrelvolkfire: Oak is strong
[2:16:39] wpprrz: 7
[2:16:41] SenorTostada: Country OAK TAKE ME HOOOME
[2:16:43] Wulf92: @Naguura Hello there
[2:17:00] turboer: does it have matting on the back
[2:17:12] Sebleh: this is why your shit doesn’t work you just roll over cables
[2:17:15] Sebleh: naguuraWeirdChamp
[2:17:25] Tephaine: looks good but depends on the walls. if they are Dark and the floor tiles are Dark it might get to be a Dark room
[2:17:26] Xastin3: she just sits on all cables
