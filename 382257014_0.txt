Na verdade ele nunca conheceu nenhum de seus pais, e nunca teve nenhum amigo em nossa aldeia. Mesmo assim eu nunca vi ele chorar, ficar zangado ou se dar por vencido, ele está sempre disposto a melhorar, ele quer ser respeitado, é o sonho dele e o Naruto daria a vida por isso sem hesitar. Meu palpite é que ele se cansou de chorar e decidiu fazer alguma coisa a respeito!

[5:50:17] Moobot: That's a tad too many emotes, @Hunterzuurah (warning)

That being said, I still think buffing baseline damage and nerfing cd damage (while reverting mana changes) would make the game far more enjoyable for everyone on the ladder, as well as more entertaining to watch in tourney play.

[6:08:58] Jeuffrey: zephah that is true, that means that blizzard doesnt know what they are doing when they nerfed mana regen of healers. mana burn is bad for the game tho. overall bursts are too high and out-of-burst damage is hitting like wet noodles.
[6:08:58] degustadordegrelo: Triple restro druid
[6:09:02] NeroPuro: yeah Virus2508 that's too bad though, a pro should be able to play multiple classes including melee
[6:09:02] veniceboat: no way counter dk+dh with spell dmg again will be fail they just abuse dmg mage and won

[6:09:04] trashcanolian: "WITH GREEN GEAR"
[6:09:05] its_mike: @jeuffrey it does when the comp is meant to go into high dampening to win. Melee cleaves that do mana burn are trying to win as quickly as possible and they also have a win condition: Mana. With this win condition either they win immediately or middle game when the healer is oom.
