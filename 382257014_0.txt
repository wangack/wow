Purple shirt guys jacket isnt fitted right, sleeves are to long. Far left is the best fitted, but the suit looks like it belongs in the 70s especially with that stache and haircut.

Mesmo assim eu nunca vi ele chorar, ficar zangado ou se dar por vencido, ele est√° sempre disposto a melhorar, ele quer ser respeitado, √© o sonho dele e o Naruto daria a vida por isso sem hesitar.

[6:01:57] JerryBuckx: @nowaysilas thats because the game is based entirely around cooldowns. Most lower rated players poorly manage their defensive cooldowns, which leads to shorter games. That being said, I still think buffing baseline damage and nerfing cd damage (while reverting mana changes) would make the game far more enjoyable for everyone on the ladder, as well as more entertaining to watch in tourney play.

[6:08:58] Jeuffrey: zephah that is true, that means that blizzard doesnt know what they are doing when they nerfed mana regen of healers. mana burn is bad for the game tho. overall bursts are too high and out-of-burst damage is hitting like wet noodles.
[6:08:58] degustadordegrelo: Triple restro druid
[6:09:02] NeroPuro: yeah Virus2508 that's too bad though, a pro should be able to play multiple classes including melee

[6:09:04] trashcanolian: "WITH GREEN GEAR"
[6:09:05] its_mike: @jeuffrey it does when the comp is meant to go into high dampening to win. Melee cleaves that do mana burn are trying to win as quickly as possible and they also have a win condition: Mana. With this win condition either they win immediately or middle game when the healer is oom.
