[0:56:32] BruinsFan: I don't know if I want to take that 100k hit tho, so hard to pay that much for something only relevant for less than a year
[0:56:36] 6all: @Aguilar_313 targetting, keybinds, rotation speed. if you wanna like open world quest and level you can make it work

[1:33:41] jerkchickenpapi: What a question lol

[1:34:50] Shugaze: because of shortage
[1:34:58] Heero_Effect: towWipe
[1:35:11] MyNameIsVortex: @Lintgamer Just because they don't speak about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. From a fellow Belg (Gent)
[1:35:17] CeruleanStar: it's technically for diabetes
[1:35:17] dimofodi: I was doing real good with the weight loss, Dr said basically my body isn't triggering that I'm full so I just keep eating. The medicine is supposed to help  my body regulate that. I lost 15 lbs so far since my last Weight Loss appt but without the medicine I'm slipping again.
[1:35:27] jerkchickenpapi: So it’s like the opposite of Aleta in
[1:35:31] jerkchickenpapi: Apetamin
[1:35:41] love_eggplant: you can gain that feeling without medication
[1:35:42] itjustfeelsright: there are people sueing ozempic now because it causes stomach paralysis
[1:35:45] Shugaze: thats why I take that injection on sundays LUL
[1:35:55] Alepouditsa: are the goin to give us more exp for the aniversity
[1:35:57] CeruleanStar: but you still have to inject it? :(
[1:36:01] love_eggplant: but when they quit with ozempic they gain it all back
[1:36:02] simonbgg: Interesting! :) Sounds abit "unhealthy" with the whole punishing you for wanting to eat haha. Instead of just eating food thats makes me more full.
[1:36:04] love_eggplant: so its kinda bad lol
[1:36:08] simonbgg: Mindset-wise
[1:36:22] drunkieduckie: Pet battle master!
[1:36:24] ParfumAmerican: for me worked - 1 meal a day in a 2h window - that's all
[1:36:33] dimofodi: They're weekly.
[1:36:34] mavericks312: Isn’t there a global shortage of those meds now since ppl are using it just for weight loss?
[1:36:40] littlegooaatt: odds the servers are actually up tmrw at 11 ?
[1:36:40] HaxzorJimDuggan: https://x.com/Xbox/status/1724064633202626957?s=20 the chocolate controllers are from a sweepstakes, this is the follow/retweet link
[1:36:43] CeruleanStar: i thinkt he big ones are daily but the rando's are weekly ?
[1:36:47] NobodybetterPat: i feel like ive only seen like 2 of them.
[1:36:54] Noshpan: Oh, that reminds me that I need to take my skyrizi injections
[1:36:55] ElmSpace: think they are biweekly
[1:37:02] love_eggplant: theres a shortage here for over a year
[1:37:05] love_eggplant: lol
[1:37:14] dimofodi: I see 1 or 2 a day maybe. Some of them are definitely bugged. I killed one and it didn't give me credit and I waited for hours, it never spawned again.
[1:37:14] simonbgg: Feels more like a quickfix tho more than a longterm healthy thing?
[1:37:15] ididntdoitfr: They were like "we're missing out on money, we need to fix this"
[1:37:40] TeenyPriest: It's still in shortage.  I've been waiting for mine for 3 weeks.
[1:38:02] mavericks312: @simonbgg yes and no to rely on it is bad but most ppl use it to train themselves to eat more healthy and have better habits
[1:38:15] CeruleanStar: @Towelliee did you get exercise going too ?
[1:38:15] mavericks312: Less*
[1:38:39] ezpzKolbyJCheesy: Sometimes all it takes is a push to get the momentum going, then you can become self sufficient
[1:39:19] mavericks312: Yea if once your off of it you go back to eating pizza and cheesesteaks everyday it was all for not
[1:39:24] CeruleanStar: most people just need a kick to get started :D
[1:39:32] Shugaze: fat shaming people working out or taking meds is wild to me

[1:58:15] Foxdoabarrelrofl: it was great though
[1:58:16] mavros_kyrios: Which server are you on?
[1:58:17] drunkieduckie: @towelliee I’m new to watching twotch but have been enjoying yours a lot this month, happy to subscribe =)
[1:58:18] Nerendis: Last season was absurdly fast
[1:58:20] Foxdoabarrelrofl: could play other games
[1:58:23] Foxdoabarrelrofl: come back and raid
[1:58:27] AnimalCrackers_19: D4 was coming out tho fast gear was great
[1:58:30] DovahChicken: got my cap on the upgrade mats and flightstones so doing be a good season
[1:58:46] ambiotic: My aug is 12 days old and I was doing 25s this week lol
[1:58:51] ReliRevi: @Towelliee am i too late for the big rep grinds in dragonflight as a returning player? saw a vid that the big weekly events are baron now
[1:58:58] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee they slowed it down like 40% thats not a little bit haha
[1:59:06] chavychav444: 420 NICE
[1:59:13] Foxdoabarrelrofl: 8 upgrades would have been fine 6 slows it down a lot
[1:59:14] akia03: isnt the raid dropping allot less gear aswel
[1:59:17] DovahChicken: @ReliRevi  nope they have catch up rep bonus now
[1:59:21] Molvonos: I think they kinda broke the 'seasonal limit' on crests.  I keep getting Whelpling crests and the season limit is currently 90.
[1:59:21] warrenny: Faster gearing was cool but i think i went too hard on keys early on burnt myself out super quick
[1:59:40] DovahChicken: @ReliRevi  also the rep is not important anyways
[1:59:42] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @akia03 yea they changed the amount of tier droping to 1:3 instead of 1:!
[1:59:47] falldrgn: you want to be compensated for your time investment
[1:59:52] atsq1: I’ll probably run mythics to get ready to suffer and pug heroic raid
[1:59:53] MortalLesuj: @Molvonos youll get a loot alert. but you dont actually loot anymore
[2:00:17] Molvonos: @MortalLesuj I have 168/90 crests atm tho.
[2:00:33] Tac2cul: @Molvonos mine stopped dropping at 105
[2:00:35] MortalLesuj: yeah you should. a lot of campaign quests go over cap
[2:00:48] Sttarrkz: i like the fact that gearing goes slower, and the raid will be abit harder. so I wont be done after 3 weeks into the new season xD
[2:00:51] warrenny: @falldrgn Yes but theres a point where its too fast
[2:00:56] MortalLesuj: or dont count towards cap is more accurate
[2:00:59] cabalish: 454 normal
[2:01:09] atsq1: I pugged s1 and s2 raids and it was hard, in and out of a lot of groups
[2:01:09] cabalish: 467 heroic
[2:01:16] devoted_bee: tasnHAI oh hai Towelliee
[2:01:20] cabalish: 441 lfr
[2:01:22] its__fate: 447
[2:01:28] sideorderofeggrolls: what server are you on?
[2:01:30] Nerendis: You basically have to start normal tomorrow. It's kinda weird
[2:01:32] mavericks312: So you need to be like what 420 to que for lfr
[2:01:47] Sollice: Molv, I am getting on my hunter soon. I expect you to hand hold me and tell me everything I need to do to gear up
[2:01:52] DovahChicken: 11 give 457 end of run so thats crazy
[2:01:57] Foxdoabarrelrofl: spamming 11 waycrest until i die or get balefire
[2:02:10] Heero_Effect: I think I may just be a normal/LFR. Normally I go for aotc, but don’t really care
[2:02:11] Molvonos: @Sollice Step 1: Play the character for more than three days.
[2:02:16] HaloS23: wait... next one higher or lower?
[2:02:22] Sollice: Ouch.......hard first requirement
[2:02:25] the_inhumanatee: @Foxdoabarrelrofl its shadowgem and spoils all over again hahaha
[2:02:25] mattmasters96: that was a big change
[2:02:26] Molvonos: lolol
[2:02:38] Sollice: Who do you think I am
[2:02:40] senedrak: !server
[2:02:48] atsq1: I really liked s2 because I was able to complete what I wanted too and then could play other games
[2:02:51] Ckraigfriend: and you can buy bigger crest with small ones
[2:03:01] rbayduden: @Towelliee i just got back into wow, after being away since s1. How do i get charges for the catalyst in season 2 ?
[2:03:02] Molvonos: Someone with almost as severe ALTitis as Bert does.
[2:03:16] warrenny: Crests is a good system but has been massively improved
[2:03:19] HaloS23: @Ckraigfriend does that include aspect ones?
[2:03:21] Gezber: LUL
[2:03:26] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @the_inhumanatee yea lol or ragefeather...took me 73 runs of nokhud to get that...shadowgem i gto really fast. i play mage so i want to get balefire or mirror early so i can farm the other haha
[2:03:29] Fizzknight: Hey Towel
[2:03:31] priestru: While I understand you like slower paced gearing, you have to take into consideration that you play 10 hours a day. A casual 2 hour a day gamer like me will take forever to gear. Is that where catchups mechanics should take place?
[2:03:32] ZeusDNA: @rbayduden No charges right now for s2 gear.
[2:03:56] ZeusDNA: You can turn s2 gear into tier without needing a charge
[2:03:56] NobodybetterPat: season 2 charges should be free now
[2:04:00] Mecabeast: S3 is 1 charge every other week
[2:04:04] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @ZeusDNA thats not true...you get charges to get 450 tier
[2:04:07] Fizzknight: Fizzknight subscribed with Prime. 
[2:04:07] Elff11: You can
[2:04:13] atsq1: Have you crafted anything yet?
[2:04:28] ZeusDNA: @Foxdoabarrelrofl You don't use any charge anymore to turn items through catalyst. I just lets you transform without limit

[2:05:02] ZeusDNA: @Foxdoabarrelrofl strictly for s2 gear
[2:05:28] Molvonos: I crafted mine a few days ago.  463 pants. I have to remake all my shit.
[2:05:30] Dashamidon: They just need to do away with crest like upgrade systems, and go to a rep upgrade system. And then do with the current profession system needs to go
[2:05:32] Gezber: Lil piggy wants to ninja the ores
[2:05:45] Molvonos: @Dashamidon There's classic for that hot take.
[2:05:55] mongsns: do we know how we get the legendary weapon?
[2:05:57] the_inhumanatee: imagine an Emerald Dream patch without a Druid legendary FeelsBadMan
[2:06:10] 6all: other tank prot war?
[2:06:11] occtriple: its a 2h weapon isnt it?
[2:06:17] 6all: or blood
[2:06:18] ZeusDNA: @Molvonos I think they just need to do away with every system in the game and it's just sit around killing boars towSip
[2:06:25] justagamingfiend: i already got a spark and made a 463 shield
[2:06:28] Molvonos: @occtriple Yep, 2h STR weapon
[2:06:40] Sollice: @Molvonos That man chose violence. He wanst gear and weapons attached to a rep grind?
[2:06:54] Molvonos: @Sollice he just wants free loot shipped to his mailbox.
[2:06:56] justagamingfiend: 463
[2:06:57] dead_lee_: 486
[2:06:57] 6all: they reverted the nerf
[2:06:58] Dashamidon: Needs to be in retail again too so screwed up the game when they did this new crest and new crafting system stink
[2:06:59] Elff11: 489 I thought
[2:07:09] Gezber: That's fine, as long as the rep is gained in a raid
[2:07:11] drunkieduckie: I haven’t done Raids or LFR since legion, but I will start again for the legendary on my warrior
[2:07:11] Sollice: @Dashamidon You stink
[2:07:16] pixi5962: !drop
[2:07:16] Molvonos: @Dashamidon The new systems dont stink.  That's just your opinion, and one that isnt shared.
[2:07:21] PhoazXD: 486
[2:07:22] dimofodi: It has to be higher than 463....that's no where near Mythic level so would be utterly useless outside of RWF.
[2:07:27] Mikayyy: for rsure
[2:07:27] 6all: its 3 ilvls below max just like last patch
[2:07:48] Felldoh_: Definitely the best iteration of upgrading they have designed so far
[2:07:49] Nerendis: Crafting is 486
[2:08:18] atsq1: I didn’t really do any crafting last season - I need to figure out how the enchanting works
[2:08:38] Felldoh_: Exactly! Dude I was trying to explain to a friend why I like this system so much, you just summed it up perfectly
[2:08:59] pikwi406: it hyper spawns there
[2:09:05] flyingmachin3: they just hyperspawn sometimes with nets
[2:09:06] pikwi406: when there are alot of ppl
[2:09:07] Verdell263: Famous last words
[2:09:08] raldrik: they hyperspawn
[2:09:19] koronay: !Drop

[2:10:36] maxxstackzzx: When does rwf start ?
[2:10:43] Dashamidon: Do they have a list of where the casters are?
[2:10:49] smashwow: she did and then left
[2:11:04] fillefaren: I mean Liquid casting is nothing compared to Echos
[2:11:07] dimofodi: She may still be in Liquid but if they don't hire her to cast, they likely let her be free to cast someone else.
[2:11:11] Heero_Effect: Preach seems loyal to echo
[2:11:13] TLew02: probably easier for her travel wise
[2:11:27] itjustfeelsright: ah, well it makes sense a bit since she is in europe
[2:11:42] Mikayyy: yeah echo makes more sense for her
[2:11:44] Vohodian: Show me the money!
[2:11:49] Felldoh_: Inventory full... the real vanilla experience
[2:11:58] Heero_Effect: Echo’s casting honestly is top tier. They found  good way to make it fun and entertaining especially during hours of splits lol

[2:27:43] WeE_wOo_WhEn: they just playing mind games with Liquid
[2:27:49] MKBragg: I don't see how that would work for Echo, NA fanboys would choose Liquid over Echo when it came to heling with splits
[2:27:49] Foxdoabarrelrofl: def a power move to spook liquid
[2:27:51] WeE_wOo_WhEn: imagine hearing you didn't have a 12hr buffer

[2:30:34] Mikayyy: method?
[2:30:37] aspiration89: @Sollice LUL I do that all the time. Have the MX keys keyboard and sometimes I forget to switch the device back
[2:30:48] CeruleanStar: what if method comes in and wins it all on EU ? lol :D
[2:30:50] Mikayyy: imagine method wins the race LUL
[2:30:52] Alepouditsa: and then you learn the moved to NA
[2:30:58] Ckraigfriend: they have a funny video on twitter about the transfer
[2:30:59] ididntdoitfr: Is the leggo just a drop from Fyrrak?
[2:31:00] eazylilbro: wow becomes NA only.
[2:31:01] Ledeanna: maybe they are doing this to prove to Blizzard about how unfair the Race is between regions instead of the protest quit @towelliee was saying
[2:31:05] Ballcuzzii: so it
[2:31:05] byrdeen45: Does the legianary only drop in mythic ?
[2:31:12] Dashamidon: I think it will be a very long tier again, and i seeit as going into the 3 week mark
[2:31:14] Eviltuna13: Method did good last race
[2:31:19] DunzoCD: would be funny if method won the race after echo went NA lol
[2:31:21] Wulfgrym: they would do it to WIN
[2:31:32] Wulfgrym: this is competition, do everything you need to win
[2:31:37] CeruleanStar: @byrdeen45 1st legendary hast o drop on mythic, that unlocks it dropping in all difficulties
[2:31:42] Nebulizer87: i think this is bait gingi acting sus
[2:31:43] raldrik: this will also juice viewership. Giving it a little extra hype
[2:31:45] Niksen_99: This is fair yes
[2:31:46] Heero_Effect: L danCult
[2:31:50] Sollice: Well I am going from a 75% to a 65%
[2:32:03] ZeusDNA: I don't know how much I believe of this. Gingi can't keep a straight face when he's talking about it lol
[2:32:05] CeruleanStar: @byrdeen45 but it is also region locked,, so US andNA have to beat mythic raid before it starts to drop
[2:32:06] Sollice: and trying to type fast. I meant I make these mistakes all the time so its probably not the keyboard regardless :P

[2:32:45] Mikayyy: someone would have known
[2:32:45] Sollice: You did. And you control the memes so I don't have something to remind you...or myself...or chat
[2:32:53] HaxzorJimDuggan: maybe they are on the Dentarg server
[2:32:53] ididntdoitfr: @SamuraiWillZ916 what i was just thinking LUL
[2:32:56] Molvonos: LUL
[2:32:58] Felldoh_: Couldn't they just guild transfer today?
[2:33:01] Freddye: I think blizzard have helped them transfer
[2:33:02] CeruleanStar: maybe blizzard just xferred them all for them ?
[2:33:04] mavericks312: Wait echo has an NA guild?
[2:33:08] theviperleet: @Towelliee They bought the accounts? :D
[2:33:09] ZeusDNA: It'd be cool if they did. But I don't belive it
[2:33:11] haiil: @Towelliee  secret global release on a dev server or something?
[2:33:11] roxt4: they also give up a bunch of EU user fan benefits of splits and such
[2:33:12] gho5tfinger: lol a new player server
[2:33:22] Heero_Effect: I don’t think you can’t do Eu to NA guild transfer
[2:33:25] Wulfgrym: They might be on the KAPPA server LUL
[2:33:25] MizixTV: It does make sense tho that their behind the scenes stream was daylight during NA day light
[2:33:29] raldrik: they also wont release the server they are on or anything like that
[2:33:29] Felldoh_: You don't think Blizz would make an exception?
[2:33:31] becoolbehpppy: new player server would be funny
[2:33:33] realiteegaming: what if bliz made the tech?
[2:33:37] Thoreya: apparently theyre just trolling
[2:33:39] Niksen_99: Damn this will be so sick if its true
[2:33:41] Thoreya: idk what the point of that is but lol
[2:33:46] xrandomdoodx: I wonder why they would even keep it a secret this long though. Wouldn't it be better to build the hype for a longer time? lol
[2:33:49] CeruleanStar: well @gingitv is on now
[2:34:06] akia03: you think bliz will ever merge regions?
[2:34:15] Heero_Effect: “Marketing” now everyone is talking about echo lol
[2:34:18] Ckraigfriend: gingi claims they are not but they have been troling with renown videos and other stuff all week
[2:34:21] Wulfgrym: IF they did that, Echo has to be the ultimate sweaty nerds in wow.
[2:34:33] haiil: maybe it is just get prove a point or something like that? that it would be neat if it was global release? like a little finger in the side on bliz?
[2:34:48] mavericks312: That would take a week long maintenance
[2:34:49] gho5tfinger: gingi swearing its not bait right now
[2:35:01] mavericks312: If not longer
[2:35:09] aspiration89: It's bait for sure
[2:35:11] Dashamidon: its not to mention thatyou would know because how would echo get all that money or gearing
[2:35:12] HaxzorJimDuggan: its an out of season april fools joke
[2:35:13] dimofodi: It isn't just a tech thing though I thought it came from an issue with how the money has to work etc etc.
[2:35:19] 6all: they can do it with a restructing of their server architecture by mirroring but would be super expensive
[2:35:19] MizixTV: It does make sense tho that their behind the scenes stream was daylight during NA day light
[2:35:22] gho5tfinger: lol said he impressed no one found out

[2:39:21] roxt4: They are diving into NA Mythic just to get some of the world first kills for the memes then doing EU mythics for real.  Since most world first guilds will be splitting
[2:39:38] akia03: he also said they are in the states and not in sweden

[2:47:43] raldrik: its such a big troll
[2:47:46] Redpandalol: @Towelliee to my understanding is they are having 1 geared main character on us servers to clear the raid on heroic and data collect on fyraak
[2:48:06] Sttarrkz: they didnt stream the first 2 days on release, they were on NA by then and lateron they streamed EU so no one noticed, and we thought they had a seed glitch but it was actual NA farming @Towelliee
[2:48:17] Birraga: they prob just trolling and going for wf normal or heroic on na

[2:50:12] DecayedmiNt: All I know is if they're actually doing all this and still lose to Liquid. Echo might just quit
[2:50:15] PhillyDilly18: I admire their dedication, but boy does it all seem like a lot

[2:56:49] Caddirly: 10-4
[2:56:52] ijuki: Deadmines too? POGGERS
[2:56:54] Sybsidian: ROGUE TANKS!!!! YES!!!!
[2:57:02] GroovyBryan: I'm definitely trying shaman tank
[2:57:19] bdutton90: i would not be able to sell my friends on leveling to 60 in classic. 25? way more doable
[2:57:23] limburgse: Karazhan crypts 🫶🏻
[2:57:25] Zettabyte: Deadmines towPog
[2:57:30] kamuriz: guess 19 twinks will be a thing again ^^
[2:57:33] Freddye: I was just at the toilet take a shit and I thought of something. I think Towelliee knows that they are in the US.
[2:57:37] SleepyRhino: i am hoping cause of the low level alot more casual people will be able to experience "end game" content
[2:57:37] ijuki: Warlock tank for me
[2:57:42] Xetherot: warlock tank
[2:57:42] Nevindaz: wlock EZ
[2:57:46] Xetherot: meta tank lol
[2:57:49] Vohodian: SOD kind of lets them have 3-4 seasons on one server. 25 season, 40 season, 60 season (maybe there are more?).
[2:57:50] wEiRdO_dUdE: I remember back in Wrath, there was a rogue in my guild who would tank if the regular tank died, to finish off bosses
[2:57:53] limburgse: Will Edwin vanCleef be a raidboss? 👀
[2:57:53] Niksen_99: Fury warrior
[2:58:01] Slank360: there is no seal twisting @Towelliee
[2:58:04] mrmanno14: Hunter pet gottem beat
[2:58:07] Gizimoo86: most dps classes wont tank, but some might
[2:58:21] REALPolarbeezy: Plot twist, they realize shaman are viable tanks and we see it in retail soon.
[2:58:21] Thewunk: It would be so awesome if SFK became a raid
[2:58:24] limburgse: Saaadge, such s missed chance to make that dude a raidboss!😪
[2:58:29] JesikaPlays: the red zones in stormwind !!

[2:58:39] kabukifaux: twitch needs an audio only mode when i wanna minimize and play my game at the same time and just listen without using so much bandwith
[2:58:54] Wulfgrym: rogue tank, mage healer, priest mage
[2:58:57] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think it's cool to repurpose dungeons as real 10 man raids
[2:59:00] azzystreams1: don't forget karazhan crypts
[2:59:04] toobaked1987: Dont forget Kara Crypts!!!!

[2:59:15] Periphereal: yeah i think more like gnomer 35, sm 45, kara 60, if anything
[2:59:17] Molvonos: We've come full circle, from when Scholomance and UBRS were raids.
[2:59:23] toobaked1987: Classic Plus bby! I am SO EXCITED
[2:59:23] Ledeanna: they said they are adding new bosses too
[2:59:23] limburgse: I cant wait
[2:59:28] HaxzorJimDuggan: kinda hoping they scale down the 40 man raids
[2:59:28] notmes: 480 raiders from notmes have joined! 
[2:59:28] Moobot: @NOTMES coming in with the 480 viewer raid! PogChamp
[2:59:28] wEiRdO_dUdE: New gear changes a lot of dynamics
[2:59:32] Periphereal: but they can adjust level power anyways so it doesnt really have to make sense
[2:59:34] marcusp619: boy stop capping
[2:59:36] TolgaDraws: Just make former 40 man raids 80 man raids this time around
[2:59:39] Keyastaron_: new loot

[2:59:56] Mikayyy: so retail?

[3:00:03] Pritamin: hope they nail it
[3:00:07] HaxzorJimDuggan: and its going to be free
[3:00:08] Lorilath: hit rating and being crit by things means doing level 40 dungs as a 25 is gonna be a bit much I think
[3:00:09] DarkCymru: classic andies qqing makes me lol
[3:00:12] Keyastaron_: @Towelliee  lets say WoW classic season of discovery expansions?
[3:00:14] limburgse: They should add another AQ-opening like questline, i would love to attempt to do that!😁
[3:00:16] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah some of those people expected a Hogger expansion
[3:00:18] drunkieduckie: I think classic+ is dragonflight

[3:00:39] toobaked1987: So many people will come back to Classic and be like, Oh this is an MMORPG

[3:00:56] Wulfgrym: i feel way out of sync trying to get back into retail wow. but im super stoked for SOD which i think will become my main wow

[3:13:11] wEiRdO_dUdE: Echo was making so much that they donated all their money from subs to charity, if I remember right
[3:13:21] HooDGorE: all the liquid sponsor money goes to the fund the whole org
[3:13:30] im_capy: Does Echo do commercials and stuff too similar to Liquid
[3:13:31] HooDGorE: echo rakes in the cash for sure
[3:13:35] Taylormade2711: What’s going on with Echo?

[3:17:22] KineasRM: Echo NA?
[3:17:32] 無職提督: lol
[3:17:34] barrowzz: Somebody explain “ECHO NA”
[3:17:46] Squirrel_nutty: hes typhoid mary
[3:17:49] HaxzorJimDuggan: the amount of booze sloot consumed would kill an elephant
[3:17:51] Tooyoo: He could have had it the month before
[3:17:52] GroovyBryan: Last time I had it, I was the same. Felt good, but was positive forever it seemed.
[3:17:54] cschimp: If he's had it in the past couple months he wouldn't get it
[3:17:59] Fyeah: bait

[3:18:20] teeq_010: would make the race more fair
[3:18:21] clapfosho: They gonna do a normal clear
[3:18:23] barrowzz: oh that’s wild yeah adge revenue
[3:18:25] Nashness: !drops
[3:18:35] nevercluckyy: i think they are just trying to psyche out liquid oldschool tactics throwing them off their game
[3:18:37] danimoto10: ya, I am sure its gonna be a low view race
[3:18:38] Brodih_: its a very smart move before the big day tomorrow
[3:18:45] danimoto10: so they trying to bait
[3:18:46] clapfosho: Normal clear world first
[3:18:49] UthredTV: It's helpers that make me think they couldn't race on NA
[3:18:52] trivotix: Yeah, you can't switch from NA to EU yet.
[3:18:52] Steadmoh190: a camel mount nice
[3:18:57] its__fate: i think they have 1 chaqracter and they going to do heroic for last boss datamine
[3:18:58] jubee240: It happens, everyone at my job got hit with covid except me and one other dude. 🤷🏾‍♂️
[3:19:00] Alienfromger: 4 months without any leak? no way
[3:19:03] ArcaneSyntax: They're gonna do lfr tomorrow
[3:19:03] Nevindaz: imagine if Liquid secretly going to EU and Echo vice versa KEKW
[3:19:10] HooDGorE: no way they could build a NA roster that fast
[3:19:15] teeq_010: tbh i dont like watching race to splits first :P
[3:19:16] findobin: i think it might be high view since a lot of viewers are in wow section now too, theyll check it out
[3:19:21] danimoto10: ya, but here you have even more to watch lol
[3:19:31] Keyastaron_: remember raz was cheesed? the circle got to them very slowly LUL then it was hotfixed bc of the holidayus?
[3:19:33] WhatYeti: As someone who has never played any classic this HC hype made me finally give in and try it. so I could totally see this race having lower numbers
[3:19:33] barrowzz: I think it’ll be higher view count they just announced at blizcon you have tons of hype around wow I think views will be up overall for rtwf
[3:19:50] HaxzorJimDuggan: might just be a world first normal clear
[3:19:50] Jalham: this hardcore ?
[3:19:53] teeq_010: i start watching when they actually go for mythic
[3:19:56] trivotix: I know they could play with a slightly higher ping. They are the best of the best but I don't think Echo playing with NA ping would be ideal.
[3:19:59] Seerated: SoD will be even bigger/stronger than HC I'd guess. HC is kinda hard and unforgiving, SoD just sounds like alot of fun. I'm hyped for it
[3:20:25] gregl__: blizzard isnt invested into it
[3:20:28] Foxdoabarrelrofl: @Towelliee servers came up like 12pm-1pm last time so youre talking 6pm over there so yea the sleep thing is a big deal if they are actually doing it
[3:20:28] Dein95: the voiceover addon for classic is so good, makes things way more immersive
[3:20:31] mavericks312: i doubt that will ever happen cause its not blizz ran
[3:20:37] barrowzz: A wow cinematic showcasing the race would be big pog
[3:20:54] Seerated: I saw Gingi's tweet...sounds like they're in NA..who knows at this moment

[3:21:14] TweektheProphet: I am surprise that they haven't done something like lula's eggs over Azeroth  @Towelliee
[3:21:15] Alaquane: each race is a new colored rooster
[3:21:19] cytax2750: or do ti with spectral tiger xD
[3:21:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: They had an RWF toy drop before, true
[3:21:23] cytax2750: it*
[3:21:26] Molvonos: After watching that stream admission of 'wait for tomorrow', I really think it's hype-trolling.
[3:21:31] WhatYeti: Dude do that with spectral tiger (Not swift) and wow would surpass 1 million viewers lol
[3:21:37] Sollice: Will be pointless. Echo raids in US and loses..EU people "THEY LOST DUE TO LAG"
[3:21:45] barrowzz: Re color rooster drop be YUGE
[3:21:53] Steadmoh190: or spectral tiger
[3:21:54] GroovyBryan: Spectral tiger. Lol
[3:21:56] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah the camel is nice
[3:22:10] kmckowan1: Ret is getting a buff did they need it? I just started playing a pally and i love ret
[3:22:27] idkEric_: Echo just testing fyrakk on NA, everyone on some cope xdd
[3:22:45] Onomy: free gold drop. lol
[3:23:07] kmckowan1: Hey Towelliee
[3:23:10] mavericks312: i can see smaller streamers getting upset about it
[3:23:14] Steadmoh190: i had a bunch of mount presents when i went into retail didnt even know i got them but i always had a wow stream in background
[3:23:33] Niksen_99: Naowh was just told not to speak his mind about Echo announcement monkaS
[3:23:47] OnePlayerPete: OnePlayerPete subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:23:53] tempistrane: But Asmondgold said i'm not allowed to play both, if i'm a real WoW fan. I'm confused!
[3:24:14] Steadmoh190: i mean both classic and retail share one sub
[3:24:17] Noraii: How come Old School Runescape is Split from Runescape then?
[3:24:17] Steadmoh190: so why would they
[3:24:42] Seerated: It's kinda all on the same sub-fee, just keep it under the same roof
[3:24:58] Belveen: ECHO NA :)
[3:25:05] wEiRdO_dUdE: Soon it's going to be 5 versions of the game in one channel
[3:25:06] GroovyBryan: It's easy when you have 5 versions of wow. Lol
[3:25:27] drisan87: You playing SoD and what class?

[3:26:49] Steadmoh190: will sod be on hardcore aswell?
[3:26:51] Zettabyte: Hijacked*
[3:26:55] tempistrane: I bet BLizzcon was still running under some of Bobby K's policies. Got to milk people of their money.
[3:26:56] tomcruise210: shaman tank gonna be dope
[3:26:56] drisan87: true

[3:27:16] Steadmoh190: would be fun tho
[3:27:21] mavericks312: i wonder if the LFD will be in SoD
[3:27:22] Zalsaria: SoD has me worried that they are going to go a little too experimental
[3:27:27] drisan87: Which new tank do you think has the most potential?
[3:27:27] Ariidam: Do you think sod should go hardcore?
[3:27:30] wEiRdO_dUdE: Warriors are getting victory rush
[3:27:33] oussamahouri: lets go warrior healer lmao
[3:27:34] Ariidam: At some point anyway
[3:27:38] Kifimbo: Echo playing on NA is going to mess up my guild gamba's on RWF time
[3:27:43] FrankTizzle: warrior healing Kappa
[3:27:44] mavericks312: give me mage tanks
[3:27:48] ijuki: Mage can heal already in SoD
[3:27:48] Snabido: Maybe next endgame phase will have some warriors shout healing
[3:27:51] MoodyVanessa: i want a hunter healer
[3:27:51] Tooyoo: maybe they introduce support classes
[3:27:52] Zettabyte: #NOCHANGES REEEE! Kappa
[3:27:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: give warriors polymorph and frostbolt so we can troll mages
[3:27:57] iMaccaPro: survival hunter tanks finally :P
[3:28:02] tr4ncetv: DW Mages! Like that Scarlet mob
[3:28:02] Alaquane: warlock can use their pet heal to heal other players?
[3:28:04] ddsoad: Bandage Spec
[3:28:05] Gaikang_: ranged paladin dps you cowards
[3:28:09] Thicc_Fil_A: I’d love a pally or warrior dps spec that uses a sword and shield. Sadge
[3:28:09] LancerVI: Warrior ranged axe throw/spear throw  spec could happen though
[3:28:14] treeshark: Even the next lvl cap might switch things up more than we know atm
[3:28:16] Ledeanna: they already said Mage Healer in this SoD
[3:28:16] Seerated: Technically, mages already tanked in Gruul's Lair :D

[3:29:20] mavericks312: the just chatting streamers wont be playing hardcore forever lol
[3:29:37] Seerated: It is yep. There's still a BIG thing to hit 60 on HC, both for streamers and us other noobs
[3:29:39] HaxzorJimDuggan: i'd like to see TBC hardcore people getting crushed by fel reavers would never get old
[3:29:40] FrankTizzle: @Towelliee It also helps that since its hardcore, there is an inherent gear and gold sink; no one can really just be accumulating nonstop (with no risk)
[3:29:46] DecayedmiNt: Just like for a lot of Onlyfang people its their first time really playing WoW. The addiction is just starting
[3:29:55] Steadmoh190: not really, people still play classic era servers that are pvp and they are always high pop servers

[3:32:43] tomcruise210: it was HC
[3:32:54] hand__0__doom: Games that don't die don't rely on streamers to get their world populated. U can't be hugely popular and organically so

[3:33:14] Steadmoh190: if*
[3:33:23] im_capy: I dont think a lot of people realize how many people dont watch twitch and play warcraft.
[3:33:35] hand__0__doom: Nobody watches guildwars and that game doesn't really die
[3:33:36] jaedfe: Savix tried the retail "only grey item" HC challenge and couldnt finish. Said it was really hard.

[4:15:49] Panoramics: best coffee I've ever had was in Dom Republic, fresh sun roasted, served in a tiny cup with some fresh cane sugar. OMG.
[4:15:57] fakevaltteri: It's made from Real Cubans. That's how you know it's good.
[4:15:59] SpoofAvatar: Cuban coffee is about twice as strong as regular American coffee. When properly prepared, it comes out as a thick, unabashedly strong, slightly syrupy brew with a captivating aroma. This richness mainly comes from a unique blend of Robusta and Arabica beans and a special roasting formula.
[4:15:59] fillefaren: What do you say to ur friends from ur good old days? That u play video games for a living? KEKW

[4:16:10] mavericks312: @Cower311 again your not wrong i realized myself in time to kinda change my goal plan
[4:16:14] iamelcapitan: To give a little answer... cuban coffee is espresso based

[4:25:25] FranciscoTheMage: the real ozempic prices are insane
[4:25:37] Cower311: 18 hrs for 100% all accolades is literally nothing and the entire game shouldve just been a dlc

[4:38:16] drunkieduckie: I’d probably die in northshire if I did HC
[4:38:17] Heero_Effect: @cower311 well I think it’s just the sentiment we already did this content. Hence why fated raids feel cheap
[4:38:31] segarth: I miss the tiers where mythic end bosses had cool secret phases. As a viewer.
[4:38:39] FranciscoTheMage: is there truth to the fact they get rid of ptr and data mining entirely?
[4:38:43] mavericks312: DF was a damn near perfect xpac all around if were bring honest
[4:38:54] jusslikedis1: yo tbh its kinda crazy how things take a circle. watched you pull SM and big ass pulls in icecrown. and as small as it is helping my boy out with bellygrub :D thanks for a totally memorable experience
[4:39:08] Cower311: @Heero_Effect idk ive always been in the minority with enjoying end of xpac lulls. give me time to do all the shit and farm some stuff ive wanted or been avoiding
[4:39:12] SamuraiWillZ916: did they let frost dks 2h again?

[4:39:55] mavericks312: i think BFA turned 99% of the players against the grind
[4:40:02] vulkankragon: dying at the hands of warchief rend blackhand is an honor. he is the cousin of the real og blackhand.

[4:40:23] LspN: Is Echo NA now?
[4:40:26] Molvonos: "Story's meh - but I hang onto Asmon's every word." is typically what I see.

[4:41:56] mavericks312: DF's story is very straight forwards
[4:41:59] Jarlan23: if it has a good step by step story, even if the story is basic af, it'll still be an upgrade over what they had
[4:42:04] vulkankragon: @Shalamyne are you sure? pretty sure the og blackhand had a cousin.
[4:42:13] futomara01: well they stopped putting the story in the books, thank god
[4:42:17] Cower311: a patch every 6 months is stressful and ya dont rly have time to do to much else. i rly enjoy luls in between

[4:42:42] Molvonos: @Heero_Effect True, but my statement stands from what i've seen/heard.  Most of the time, when someone complains of the story, they don't have a reason and point to what they heard on Asmons channel.
[4:42:43] HaloS23: @Towelliee For story, I am HERE for Anduin becoming the next Arthas!! Gonna be DEEP CUTS though!

[4:45:02] Jarlan23: level 60 priest rip
[4:45:05] mavericks312: that why its gettin ripped, cause they called it game of the generation
[4:45:05] segarth: Vyranoth turning on her brother could be seen a year ago. It’s boring story telling imo.
[4:45:11] vulkankragon: imagine a space game without any aliens
[4:45:44] segarth: Liked the last cinematic tho, and anduins return was good
[4:45:47] mavericks312: @segarth you didnt see it until 10.1? why is obvious story telling bad to you
[4:45:53] nazvar: double backstabber
[4:45:55] Shalamyne: @Towelliee Do you think Jailer's warning at the end of Sepulcher will happen or do you think they are moving away from it?
[4:46:11] Heero_Effect: They want like early season of “game of thrones” story telling in WoW lol
[4:46:24] sinlesssinner: you doing a marathon for the start of season 3? @Towelliee
[4:46:27] Jarlan23: there needs to be more build up to it
[4:46:30] mavericks312: vyranoths story isnt done till we deal with irikikron yet
[4:46:34] Featherbow: foreshadowing isn't a bad thing
[4:46:36] darkrowse21: i think story makes sense she has her own reason face off titans and not mad power like fryak
[4:46:37] HaxzorJimDuggan: triple agent
[4:46:39] Wcvechten: Once again the new book adds in alot of context for the primalists, which sucks
[4:46:42] Eruul: for silvanas
[4:46:44] segarth: I was expecting it. She was always the cautions, doubting every decision made by fyrak and iridikron (sorry for spelling of their names haha)
[4:47:04] crimsonbennie: YES
[4:47:06] gho5tfinger: ppl love to hate
[4:47:15] Jarlan23: i did. but it wasnt a ton of quests to develop those characters imo.
[4:47:18] mavericks312: these ppl want arthas/lichking build up for every villain lol
[4:47:27] MulvadDK: So many people are not paying attention to the story, and then complain LUL
[4:47:29] segarth: Ppl love to love
[4:47:32] Antdavs24: Yea it’s been pretty obvious that’s how they were headed
[4:47:33] Jarlan23: but it was better than any story in wow so far. not saying its bad

[4:48:44] MulvadDK: @Jinxterz me too man :D
[4:48:46] FranciscoTheMage: if the titans return in that third expac announced then we must be getting Illidan back then cause he's up there with them isn't he? @Towelliee
[4:48:51] drunkieduckie: Is it worth reading the shadowlands plot? Jailer was just so boring to me.  Like the expansion.
[4:48:55] HaxzorJimDuggan: the chewbacca defense
[4:48:58] Skizzurp: imagine buying a small glove to murder someone
[4:49:01] AJVALDEZ: hows it going bro?

[4:49:13] AJVALDEZ: oh he 100% did it

[4:50:53] Molvonos: I don't understand what people mean by 'underwhelming'.  Like, you want another Jailer?  Kel'Thuzad?  What?
[4:50:55] gho5tfinger: @jshukster no one knows
[4:50:56] mavericks312: @TheLionheart19 in the overall story and how there building it he makes sense as the last boss
[4:50:58] Antdavs24: Burning another tree would be banter
[4:51:13] Molvonos: Kel'thuzad wasn't even the second in command in his own story.
[4:51:14] Zubberikan: @Towelliee can you not complete all 7 chapters of the emerald dream questline just yet?

[4:52:12] kazgaurd: Really hope we dont have to deal with Tyranda and malf anymore
[4:52:12] ambiotic: for new expansions, obv lich king and garrosh are the real best
[4:52:25] Molvonos: @FranciscoTheMage He's the final raid boss for this expac.
[4:52:30] Coriollis: I think they will bring sylvanas back for her to expand on the whole " this world is a prison" at some point

[4:53:08] jshukster: but i get it hes too OP
[4:53:11] dannyis1337: is malfurion the worst used character?
