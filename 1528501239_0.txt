[2:08:51] KutzTV: @MrGharr I got into QA at my job real damn fast exactly because I had no idea how to use the application to begin with. Great way to find flaws is to just not know what the right thing is. But different from game dev no doubt.
[2:09:03] Hidden_Hybrid: we arent talking QA testers or customer service reps though
[2:09:11] Rudric_Ice: @Spiriteaser  ahha will do bud it feels good to come back to azeroth after a long break towHi
[2:09:24] dguz73: @TheCynicalKitty shadowlands was the worst story theyve ever made theyre just gonna pretend it never happened basically
[2:09:27] anOceaninadrop: @rudric_ice sure does ^^
[2:09:30] Trasheye: Did they keep the pvp marks in the early game or have they removed them ?
[2:09:36] MrGharr: @Hidden__Hybrid they got an entire studio, that includes QA too
[2:09:54] jaalexba: smelling them
[2:10:06] Pallananana: sounds like a god damn nightmare
[2:10:16] KutzTV: @Hidden__Hybrid I think they hired all levels of employees so, that could include QA too.

[2:10:50] MrGharr: I'd bet max 50% of the studio was actual code wrinting developers.
[2:10:51] KutzTV: BUT YEAH, wonder what will draw biggest hype, Webb pics of DFAlpha :p

[2:11:52] Hidden_Hybrid: i wouldnt expect anything out of them till the next expac though
[2:11:57] arrk___: do you think they have been working on dragon flight for a long time? im a bi worried about release date
[2:12:25] MrGharr: I hope they got some good brain designers too for classes
[2:12:31] belfastcl: @Lelix15 they have been working on the talents at least since 2020
[2:12:31] jRizzler: @Lelix15 They've been working on it since May from what I recall hearing.
[2:12:45] jRizzler: By them, I mean Spellbreak.
[2:12:47] badrajj: if they're women then more will leave...
[2:12:49] Hidden_Hybrid: @Lelix15 ofcourse they have. they probably started working on it before shadowlands was released
[2:13:00] badrajj: if rumours are true
[2:13:09] Rudric_Ice: i hope we get more pvp updates at the end of the day spellbreak was a pvp game
[2:13:44] mmo_kenna_: Hopefully inject some passion back into the game, when I played LostArk you could feel the passion and creativity that went into that game.

[3:04:28] Rudric_Ice: oh i didn't knew that
[3:04:28] Wadjaah: It was just content

[3:04:55] Gingerprimer: @dwolters_the_zombieman delayed
[3:05:00] Rudric_Ice: honestly 2k is like 20 bucks for asmon
[3:05:03] AerialAce94: probably made the money back in the 1st hour
[3:05:04] Funderik: either way, we're all going to play DF, it's going for a great first few months, i can't wait, the start is the best.
[3:05:20] Vexiusx: Most assets are even stolen from D3 it's not like they put in a lot of work
[3:05:22] NieIas: 200 mil for a wow expac? :O
[3:05:29] KutzTV: NotLikeThis

[3:08:49] Gingerprimer: @Funderik how it was at the start of SL after all the fun parts were done . Doing torghast weekly
[3:08:54] Vexiusx: quin went all out
[3:09:03] rosina_scarlett: someone he grouped with was 93

[3:11:05] Crowargus: lol
[3:11:05] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[3:11:06] PadidinJones: Its a good toilet game
[3:11:14] AerialAce94: im sure the server will crash atleast 50 times which means plenty of in between time
[3:11:25] thymos_: @Algfader tell me your idea of a show Kappa
[3:11:38] MaX_DutchyW: iam rewatching peaky blinders KEKW
[3:11:40] Wadjaah: damn multitasker
[3:12:04] Crowargus: think an old movie id like watch again is heat with deniro n pacino been thinking bout the movie a bit so good
[3:12:16] Funderik: i'm a little worried blizzard have gone too far the other way in DF and stripped it down to be classic amounts of content and we end up raid logging.
[3:12:28] nephttv_: @Towelliee how many more runs you got?
[3:12:36] Rudric_Ice: do u believe in aliens towelliee ?
[3:13:10] thymos_: I now believe in aliens after watching rick and morty @Neph__98

[3:14:59] keeindordel: imagine world pvp while dragonriding
[3:14:59] AerialAce94: {insert random DF assertion here}
[3:15:10] Akermay: You think flying will be improved through rep or actual time/experience flying?
[3:15:12] Wadjaah: I'm worried about what will be the purpose of dragon riding content wise. What will you do that is interesting enough while dragon riding?
[3:15:13] Polvs: not played since 9.1 trying to catch up but this sucks :/
[3:15:29] Rudric_Ice: if thd wants AP back then i want titanforging back
[3:15:31] Ashwintz: looking forward to the profession grind
[3:15:31] keeindordel: DF is another MoP
[3:15:43] Sleepylol93: Blizzard and giving hah
[3:15:45] Thdlock: @Rudric_Ice, i mean i want that back too LUL
[3:15:45] DreadgrimDK: True i play alot and i want there to be big gap between me and a Raidloging andy
[3:15:56] Funderik: having grinds isn't always a bad thing, being FORCED to grind is the bad thing.
[3:16:15] Nevindaz: dailies .. towOof
[3:16:16] keeindordel: TRIGGERED
[3:16:18] Frostfox_ZA: I was questing in old content area's (chromie time) and couldn't help but realise how many fixes they could make to better objectify their quest chains.
[3:16:29] Rudric_Ice: @Thdlock my man
[3:16:31] Ninetailedfox1989: @Towelliee  i dont see the point of the whole dragon flying thing.. i mean you farm for months to get all the parts of the dragon.. that cool and all but what about the expantion after that? will they improve on it or just throw it away like all the other things they do.
[3:16:45] Thdlock: power :)
[3:16:55] havenbirch: artifact weapons were great
[3:17:13] memnon94: I mean they did cut a HUGE amount of content from draenor, for example a whole continent, world boss etc., could have been an amazing expansion
[3:17:34] teal7silence: Just have it where all these ways to get power, are isolated from each other. Where no matter which path you chose, the power between them will be the same
[3:17:37] keeindordel: LEGION WAS LAST GOOD EXPANSION
[3:17:38] AerialAce94: people just need to stop caring about min/maxing when they are only doing +15s and heroic raiding
[3:17:53] Pallananana: magetower was peak
[3:17:53] Funderik: @Frostfox_ZA i noticed that too, when i was doing lore master achieve, even had a gm come manually get on my char and fix a quest cause it was broken in cata. but it's a waste of for them to go back and fix old content if it's rarely played.
[3:17:54] foofighters182: test
[3:17:56] Nevindaz: ye but they're so powerless now :(
[3:18:13] Blackminuz: relic weapon like ff14?

[3:18:47] denzau: i think its always the case that when the class design/combat is good, the expansion is good. even when the xpac has shitty systems people dont care much if its fun to press buttons.
[3:18:49] brand0nhxc: im just now coming back after quite a while but didnt they bring back the mage tower quests? like i really wanna grind out my feral mogs oouf
[3:18:51] Frostfox_ZA: @Frostfox_ZA I absolutely agree. I just think its something 1 - 3 people could go around doing. Cleaning up quests that haven't worked in ages.
[3:18:57] Crowargus: i dont mind a grind as long as theres a finish point might take alot to get to it
[3:19:01] nephttv_: I can't wait to do the dragon tower in DF
[3:19:19] officialviz: I want to grind the dragon tower for 6 floors, then 9 later, then 12
[3:19:28] Dudutoolbox: cant wait for the 20 years anniversary in 2 years, wonder what they will do
[3:19:43] Frostfox_ZA: @Frostfox_ZA Following this, they don't have "many" - considering the total amount of quests they have in the game ^_^
[3:19:49] NieIas: apexis dailies LUL
[3:20:00] ashwing_: WoD leveling was top tier
[3:20:03] xRaZoNx: good morning towHAMUP
[3:20:13] Ninetailedfox1989: im more worried if they will scrap the dragon flying after the expaion.. then all that farming for the dragon parts would be a waste of time.
[3:20:13] Blackminuz: WoD pvp was god tier :D
[3:20:16] Nevindaz: imagine what if the last patch 7.3 antorus of legion would've been an entire expansion.. with more story about Draenei and content
[3:20:27] Funderik: farming the fangs for the red boar mount, peak wod gameplay.
[3:20:37] havenbirch: i hope the new world content team will giv3
[3:20:47] onous_: Nobody cares about Draenei.
[3:20:55] Wotsefak: loved the challenge modes in WoD
[3:21:00] memnon94: @Towelliee "20 Things That Didn't Make it to Warlords of Draenor WoW" watch this video on youtube and you will see, that draenor could have been a fucking amazing  expansion
[3:21:01] Dudutoolbox: right we want more elves
[3:21:05] Funderik: 5k fangs i think the red one is, been awhile
[3:21:09] j3pp3tt0: Morning
[3:21:18] Pallananana: the god damn awful amount of boar mounts ... i'm starting to remember KEKW
[3:21:24] onous_: nah, more zug zug less elves.
[3:21:27] j3pp3tt0: What name plate addon do you use?
[3:21:35] Densetsu_: @Ninetailedfox1989 Im sure they will. Usually not much follows in to a new expansion
[3:21:48] Squirrel_nutty: !ui

[3:22:24] j3pp3tt0: Okay I need to mess around with mine then
[3:22:43] SAMBBA1: Hey, what addon is that circle around your mouse?
[3:22:50] Krelborn: Im most likely the outlier here, but i don't like any of the stuff they've showed of the new class and race
[3:22:56] Ninetailedfox1989: @Densetsu_  then i dont see a point in  playing the expaion if its only used in one area only to be forgotten.. just shows wow makes good ideas but never hold them after expations.. its why im still waiting for at least 3 good expaions  for me to return.
[3:23:12] Meanseason: honestly my only current gripe/issue is not yet sold on only having  such few dungeons etc... unless i read it wrong ; isnt it launching out the gate with just 4  and using older dungeons from recent expansions for mythic season 1 etc? not sure how i feel about such few new dungeons at expansion launch
[3:23:33] NieIas: i wonder if SL had less subs than WoD at its lowest i guess so
[3:23:39] officialviz: how many subs do you think current wow has

[3:24:46] Meanseason: yeah not sure if im sold on that yet honestly @Kisswani
[3:24:50] onous_: You can still make a great deal of gold off mission tables.
[3:25:13] Densetsu_: @Ninetailedfox1989 Well, you get new raids and dungeons hehe. Thats why I play in the beginning of every expansion, to get bored some months in. Hopefully this keeps me in longer, doubt it though.

[3:26:27] Squirrel_nutty: percentage likely to drop
[3:26:33] Ninetailedfox1989: @Densetsu_  yeah.. though for me  at this point wow should do a ff14 and destroy their game and bring in  wow 2 with better grapgics/story and so on and so forth that far better then what fomula they been clinging too.
[3:27:04] Bo96ma: ur dk mog is actually sick

[3:27:23] Gingerprimer: @Ninetailedfox1989 at that point wow is prob just not for you anymore
[3:27:25] Lonedh: I don’t think that’s correct squirrel or he’d have it by now
[3:27:28] Sleepylol93: They should just make > farm 100-200 times per mount and the really rare ones maybe 10 of em like 500-600  and thats it

[5:03:47] Thdlock: that will do
[5:03:55] TheBeardedChief: need 25 more boxes
[5:03:58] Zivs: that's the free waist isn't it
[5:04:34] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee How do you know, maybe we get a mage tower Torghast thing and we get to use them again LOL
[5:04:34] TheBeardedChief: had my match off
[5:04:43] grimmy17: Noooo you get soul ash from the 262 also
[5:04:59] procyon_mfc: o/
[5:05:03] nvnto: 5150*2 >>  10300 / 250 >> 41.2= 42 boxes for 2 leggos
[5:05:13] grimmy17: You get all the ash/cinders you need from the 262
[5:05:17] DoubleNova: they need to streamline this ish
[5:05:19] TheBeardedChief: an take the port thats there wont have to take the flypath
[5:05:47] Torjix: 22 should do
[5:05:48] Specsifier: I can't understand why they keep throwing a "tax" on this. It should just be a 1:1 transfer. Its rediculus
[5:06:01] zysmos: currencies should be account wide
[5:06:06] grimmy17: Chat the baiting is unreal
[5:06:25] AerialAce94: it would be a shame if the game encouraged alts
[5:06:33] illusion1990: why are you not using the portal to orb right in Korthia?
[5:06:45] grimmy17: If you scrap that 262 leggo, that's all the ash/cinders you need for 1 leggo. So you only needed 20 boxes of ash, and 7 of cinders for the 2nd one
[5:06:46] Cosmolus: KEKW

[5:07:23] zysmos: still dogshit imo
[5:07:46] Thdlock: BRING BACK AP AND TFORGING !!!
[5:07:57] Fumhi: @Thdlock word.
[5:08:01] Specsifier: torghast would have been more fun if it didn't have leggos stapled onto it
[5:08:03] grimmy17: @Thdlock Tforging was zzzzz
[5:08:04] Birder_L: maybe like the cloud rings in mop

[5:09:32] Nevindaz: done for life.. IonJam
[5:09:33] Specsifier: that'd be an unsub from me lol. I'm tired of literally only being able to play WoW and nothing else
[5:09:47] Nevindaz: with the new profession system will be nutts
[5:10:07] Chrizzor13: just give back the bfa neck and the legion weapon, and grind it up at the same time.
[5:10:09] stratiss: I think everyone would be fine with AP if it’s account wide
[5:10:30] Korupcija_: for anyone that doesn't mythic raid this is really fun
[5:10:36] Nevindaz: I hope they will keep boots away from it
[5:10:40] AerialAce94: crafting is the new grind
[5:10:56] AerialAce94: THD about to be running the AH
[5:10:57] Thdlock: im 99% sure crafting will make the raid loggers mad
[5:10:59] Thdlock: LUL
[5:11:02] Cosmolus: the thing is you need crafting to make gold so you can buy end game shit
[5:11:04] Alepouditsa: @Specsifier but there is nothing to do as a person that don't raid or mythic my sub is a wayst
[5:11:16] jmalmin: Crafted gear will give you perfect stats. Was interesting to hear Max thinking about hiring a crafting guild to help his guild get gear.
[5:11:20] Nevindaz: imagine being a master crafter in a rwf guild KEKW
[5:11:39] dergNwolf: saying something like "do m+ once a week" makes raid loggers mad KEKW
[5:11:47] Specsifier: @Specsifier I'd rather have two days a week of content for my sub than be on a grind I need to put 14 hours a day into 7 days a week otherwise I'm behind on every type of content
[5:12:04] nvnto: missives

[5:13:58] Fumhi: yeah, that would be nice

[5:14:29] Thdlock: first aid is under tailoring but ye it got removed

[5:14:32] AerialAce94: oh no wait its tailoring now
[5:14:32] Zucchey: First aid is in tailoring now
[5:14:34] Zucchey: sort of
[5:14:34] MistaHat: under tailoring i think
[5:14:35] osatox: first aid went away at end of legion, it's just a tailor/crafting item
[5:14:35] grimmy17: Tailors can make bandages
[5:14:37] doomester: we do have First aid
[5:14:40] doomester: but its Tailoring
[5:14:43] dragin1320: i feel like you should be able to have all the gathering skills and prof lik ein NW

[5:19:29] falldrgn: Taxes? What is this New World?
[5:19:42] Chrizzor13: i think its because u need the flux for s4, they dont like to funnel into one char
[5:19:45] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee You think Azshara will come back in DF, i mean we still dont know what is with her?
[5:19:46] jmalmin: All that is missing is to make the relics account wide also.
[5:19:51] flebbooo: Surely Sandworn Relics will be account-wide anytime now... COPIUM
[5:19:53] wEiRdO_dUdE: I think they probably care, it's just that they have other priorities
[5:19:57] Cosmolus: i think they want to forget about zerith mortis
[5:20:05] Rottencoarse: isnt remote mailbox account bound @Towelliee
[5:20:06] lirly__: idk why ppl malding over the "tax" its been that way since the start with cinders and ash and they never complained then
[5:20:08] Nevindaz: and Ysera 2
[5:20:16] GPTurismo: well, remember 11.0 is the 20th year anniversary, I could see azshara coming back big time then
[5:20:17] Anneris1: daddy D

[5:20:59] jasonbriggs: she might release the soul of someone she not meant too lol
[5:21:03] AerialAce94: still better then Korthia
[5:21:04] Milanesa_De_Pollo: They are hitting us with the Wrath nostalgia by making zone reminecent of Northrend, I could see us in an underground expansion and have Azjol-Nerub as a zone.
[5:21:05] caanan_: I liked zm
[5:21:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it could have really kicked ass
[5:21:08] NieIas: ZM is the blueprint for DF zones tho
[5:21:10] mavericks312: player feedback killed ZM
[5:21:11] ZakuzaGB: if i dont look at the world map for zereth mortis i get lost cos it all looks the same to me
[5:21:12] ManlyPnut: @Towelliee  but it was water we had never seen before lol
[5:21:17] Eregbueye: I think its great
[5:21:24] flebbooo: yeep, a very pretty zone with cool ideas but just very meh in the grand scheme
[5:21:26] hrdstylem: zm > korthia
[5:21:28] ArcaneSyntax: yeah I love ZM
[5:21:31] AerialAce94: but you could walk on water
[5:21:38] joe_g_433: I didn’t hate ZM. Much better than Korthia.
[5:21:43] kowaikokoro: walk on water LUL
[5:21:55] lirly__: @yepclocc everything comes at a cost, sadly
[5:21:55] Nasilvera: really dislike ZM lots of minior annoyances' and quests
[5:22:00] boompie1996: nazjatar was fun imo
[5:22:00] jmalmin: Must admit ZM is a good zone.  people there all the time.
[5:22:02] AerialAce94: i just like we could fly there, still don't know why we walking in the maw
[5:22:05] ZakuzaGB: I hate to say this and im in no way saying it was good either but i enjoyed korthia more but that may have been due to me enjoying wow more in general then
[5:22:20] wEiRdO_dUdE: People only wanting to spend 15 minutes per day there > <
[5:22:23] kjdocs: nazjatar was deep with things to do
[5:22:25] Kronvig78: I like this music. Reminds me of blackfathom depths
[5:22:28] yepclocc: @yepclocc it doesnt have to be that way. blizzard still doesnt understand theyre basically punishing players for playing the fucking game
[5:22:32] kjdocs: so many pets and mounts to grind if you wanted
[5:22:38] Engram08: Nazjatar was a fun zone imo
[5:22:41] kjdocs: and wierd crap to discover
[5:22:45] Anneris1: i had to grind rares in zm for paragon chests ;/
[5:22:50] kjdocs: yeah Nazjatar w/flying was great
[5:22:51] NieIas: the whole learn a new language was such bullshit too LUL
[5:22:56] Nevindaz: I think that also we will se the real shape of Azeroth her/himself.. bcuse I have a felling that titans and the pantheon will come again ..
[5:23:04] ZakuzaGB: I think nazjatar/mechagon was my favourite patch ever
[5:23:08] ZakuzaGB: so much stuff to do
[5:23:11] Sollice: Morning. Why is Towelliee gearing his alliance paladin? :)
[5:23:11] gl0rfindeel: are you kyrian on the pally?
[5:23:14] Thdlock: grinds FeelsGoodMan
[5:23:18] yepclocc: @yepclocc i already put in the time to grind, why am i being punished for it with some shitty arbitrary tax, unless the intent is to waste my time and keep farming more
[5:23:21] kjdocs: Agree @ZakuzaGB
[5:23:24] ArcaneSyntax: ZM is better than Nazjatar, but not as wacky fun as Mechagon
[5:23:26] PvtHudson093: get some gems
[5:23:32] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee You buy 226 gear from ZM :D
[5:23:40] kjdocs: ZM does not have more to do then Nazjatar

[5:24:24] germanos1x: @Towelliee  should we expect a blue post before alpha?
[5:24:27] Nevindaz: I think that also we will se the real shape of Azeroth her/himself.. becuse I have a felling that titans and the pantheon will come again to organise some strategic maneuvers against the void lords..
[5:24:33] gl0rfindeel: do you have to unlock the ability to use two legendaries?
[5:24:34] Thdlock: think bout how many mythic guilds actually clear trash KEKW
[5:24:38] Thdlock: thats why its so high
[5:24:41] Tebbietv: do you not raid in death jesters anymore?

[5:27:26] AerialAce94: i've soloed it on my mage atleast in Mythic
[5:27:26] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda

[5:27:54] JohnnyDrifter: I don't even have BFA flying. I need to grind the 2 added zones and tortollan rep to revered.

[5:28:52] Akermay: Why ever would you not stream on tuesday and wednesday? towCopium
[5:28:54] JohnnyDrifter: I can't stream at all anymore. Our economy is so horrible that I'm having to work 60 hours per week atm to be able to live.
[5:28:55] ArcaneMaki: HE KNOWS
[5:28:55] Nightshaft25: Alpha week hype!

[5:29:27] GPTurismo: first F&F alpha I won't have access to since first time in 20+ years I don't have a friend at blizz lol sadge
[5:29:28] Akermay: At least you'll be back on Thursday to laugh when Alpha doesn't come out LUL
[5:29:34] Sarocus: Mornin'
[5:29:37] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah it is a good idea not to expect the full expansion
[5:29:39] Nevindaz: I think that we will also see the real shape of Azeroth her/himself.. becuse I have a felling that titans and the pantheon will come again to organise some strategic maneuvers against the void lords..
[5:29:41] mackieftw: LUL
[5:29:45] not_pr0: what happened with u and draenor
[5:29:46] Rygothx: he needs two days break before alpha
[5:29:48] Nolimitzor: If i had to choose which wow streamer get Alpha invite i would choose you. Love your chill streams
[5:29:48] PvtHudson093: its too damn hot today
[5:29:52] Kisswani: New raid available Thursday for testing towCopium
[5:29:53] EppatTV: do you think we'll have all classes on alpha or only the ones with published talent trees?
[5:29:56] xendros78: towCopium
[5:30:01] PrimalRain: I just want to see some of the talent trees in action
[5:30:03] JohnnyDrifter: I won't do alpha or beta even if the inv comes in. Messes up my traditional launch day fun.
[5:30:04] JohnnyDrifter: :D
[5:30:04] vagamingpanda: Towellie will have Alpha tomorrow, but can't stream it until Thursday.....
[5:30:17] Shrenko: stop guys towCopium
[5:30:20] 1Manni1: !ALPHA
[5:30:20] Moobot: @1Manni1 PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:30:20] SirVoro: Isn't blizzards plan to lower leaks and try to keep stuff secret imagine. "Alright guys alphas out test everything now please :) Please no leakarino in the wowheadarino"
[5:30:24] EppatTV: KEKW
[5:30:31] nezz231: we dont even have all talents tree out yet
[5:30:38] FeineeWildfireSirena: !alpha
[5:30:38] Akermay: Skip to Thursday > 100 Demon Hunters doing professions
[5:30:45] Nevindaz: Dractyr demon hunter !! dracJAM
[5:30:59] wEiRdO_dUdE: Seeing some good Tuskarr action is going to be fun
[5:30:59] JohnnyDrifter: Doing the alpha/beta's I always felt messed up my expansion launches. It felt like a job when launch day happens if I've already did the content in testing.
[5:31:02] mulkon: Really? But that would mean there is no way everything is tested and available before 2023 no?
[5:31:03] Nevindaz: 2 pair of wings KEKW
[5:31:13] PadidinJones: A whole new world.... of warcraft. Yep Im a dad
[5:31:22] PvtHudson093: strap in and strap on
[5:31:23] Nightshaft25: Tuskarr hype!
[5:31:25] StreamElements: Use code POGTOWEL120 for $120 off at https://strms.net/TowellieeFactorMarBot #ad
[5:31:33] Akermay: How long do alphas normally last?
[5:31:43] Warcraftthor: how long are you expecting Alpha to be?
[5:31:55] flebbooo: Man i'mma have to sign up for that HOPIUM + Subscrition for this week
[5:31:59] PvtHudson093: He knows
[5:32:04] profy0000: Do you still think the game will release this year?
[5:32:13] drazial113: I will enjoy seeing the Alpha for sure.. every expansion offers some hope for a better expansion then the previous.. so looking forward to seeing what is coming next for sure
[5:32:20] Angxlic: wait what
[5:32:31] Nolimitzor: @Towelliee U think Blizzard might say because of covid they might delay Dragonflight  release to 2023 Q1?
[5:32:41] AerialAce94: i will reserve judgement till we actually see something as to a release date
[5:32:56] Kisswani: the zones , the mobs , all new stuff
[5:32:57] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[5:32:58] NieIas: old world revamp confirmed Pog
[5:33:07] JohnnyDrifter: I think it will launch before Christmas. They spent more time and resources in DF than they did the last 3 expansions.
[5:33:14] Kale_Nd: just give evoker and their starting zone and we are good
[5:33:25] Sollice: No blizzard won’t delay things and say Covid
[5:33:25] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah they would need lots of vendors
[5:33:32] Sollice: Covid excuses are long gone
[5:33:38] AerialAce94: oh yea forgot about the new UI
[5:33:38] McReubenn: !ALPHA
[5:33:39] Moobot: @Aero380 PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:33:42] mulkon: Yeah, people will be hyped, but the problem is that it'll also be obvious if they can hit or not the dec/22 launch date, so that can cause some backlash on the other side.
[5:33:46] Chrizzor13: the workorder ah rhing. is a huge thing for servers
[5:33:49] Nevindaz: ow yea and I wonder what addons we could be use and not..
[5:33:53] Fumhi: i hope priest is available on alpha release
[5:33:58] SirVoro: I forgot about the new UI! I am actually so hype for it.
[5:33:58] Nolimitzor: I hate when Bellular doing videos how Dragonflight will be bad ... but we didn't see nothing from expanion yet. Its kinda annoying
[5:34:03] Thdlock: KEKW
[5:34:05] Kisswani: towCopium
[5:34:15] TheAverageGoob: We DON'T know that lool
[5:34:18] Meanseason: KEKW
[5:34:19] Nevindaz: KEKW
[5:34:20] Thdlock: that would include legion and that would be fucking surprising KEKW
[5:34:20] profy0000: he is them xD
[5:34:22] grimmy17: MY FATHER WORKS FOR BLIZZARD
[5:34:24] R2RHIN0: We've got a Blizzard higher up in the chat fellas
[5:34:24] AerialAce94: clearly that is Mike in disguise
[5:34:28] Broomba: Bellular
[5:34:30] Zivs: @Nolimitzor what are you talking about lol
[5:34:33] Milanesa_De_Pollo: he's a Chinese spy
[5:34:38] Baldarsar: towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towCopium towLove towLove towLove towLove
[5:34:38] wEiRdO_dUdE: Legion got a lot more time than the typical development cycle
[5:34:42] PvtHudson093: guys take bellulars vids with a big pinch of salt
[5:34:45] DeanoTV: Ion in chat POGGERS Kappa
[5:34:46] TheAverageGoob: I am liking the direction of the game though - I left for like 6 months and feel the game has a lot of small improvements
[5:34:59] Keyastaron_: @grimmy17 that's against tos if he's not lmao
[5:35:03] SirVoro: Watching Mike do M+ yesterday while chat was trashing on him for being a vulpera was amazing LULW
[5:35:16] Thdlock: ye they have always said that
[5:35:17] Chrizzor13: they need to say it, $$$
[5:35:22] Thdlock: its not like they can say
[5:35:23] cabalish: they always on the next 2 things
[5:35:24] Nevindaz: IonJam frankly true
[5:35:26] Thdlock: ye its not going great
[5:35:33] Sielu11628: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:35:33] PvtHudson093: because Ion said there was no ripcord.....
[5:35:35] Nolimitzor: @IonHazzikostas  Hey
[5:35:38] stabzmcgeee: maybe becuase they skipped an entire patch of SL
[5:35:40] Kisswani: Ion : " we haven't started yet " Kappa
[5:35:42] grrodesu: false hope thats why
[5:35:46] R2RHIN0: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:35:48] magicclicker: LUL
[5:35:55] Sielu11628: I’m addicted to towCopium towCopium towCopium Im still not sober
[5:35:55] wEiRdO_dUdE: There is more pressure on the devs this time, with loss of so many MAUs/subs/players
[5:35:57] Nehcrom: kekw ashes.
[5:36:00] stratiss: It’s because the game is set to come out in less than 6 months lol
[5:36:22] grrodesu: their main selling point right now is flying system when theres already flying in the game
[5:36:29] Chrizzor13: they said they have a ripcord. and they didnt have one
[5:36:32] ArcaneMaki: The only difference resource-wise is the Microsoft acquisition and if it changed anything staff-wise for Blizz.
[5:36:42] Khailaan: NANI?! Two years in advance? Who knew!
[5:36:52] Skars111: your gonna get this mount one day towellie, i can see it.
[5:36:56] Broomba: Wtf?
[5:36:58] Kisswani: I saw a picture of Terran Gregory Immitation Sargeras stabbing Azeroth and that was almost 3 years before the Antorus cinematic
[5:36:58] Aquadriel: you really think the main selling point is flying? damn
[5:37:04] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mike Ybarra said that they plan to win players back, and that takes a better than average product
[5:37:05] procyon_mfc: What do u think the expansion after DF will be
[5:37:10] Nolimitzor: Ion even once said they working on 2 expansion ahead. So dunno what ppl think Dragonflight is not ready yet? Sure need alot of testing
[5:37:11] profy0000: what re your expectations for this thursday?
[5:37:11] Zolshy89: "looks cool" vs how it will play tho
[5:37:12] ArcaneSyntax: @chrizzor13 but they did? ripcord has been pulled since 9.1.5
[5:37:16] Kisswani: KEKW
[5:37:17] ArcaneMaki: good point
[5:37:20] Kisswani: TNN POGGERS
[5:37:22] Aquadriel: why do people keep thinking microsoft is already moving the strings KEKW @Towelliee
[5:37:22] Nevindaz: KEKW
[5:37:23] TheCakeBadger: if regulators allow it
[5:37:27] AerialAce94: and thats assume they don't get declined by governement bodies before that
[5:37:34] grumpnamedjosh: There is also not a bunch of man hours making and tuning borrowed power systems, so you could say there is more resources being put into the core of the game which could be helping development time.
[5:37:34] stratiss: I just really really want the updated world content to be good
[5:37:38] Khailaan: Anchorman Towel
[5:37:39] Broomba: People in chat are pulling crap out of their asses
[5:37:42] GPTurismo: mice have better memories than wow players
[5:37:42] USELES5: You expecting people to read? KEKW
[5:37:50] Sielu11628: The world has lost too many brain cells since COVID
[5:37:53] Thdlock: i mean
[5:37:57] Exodeo_: @USELES5 Reading? what's that?
[5:37:59] Thdlock: is he gonna say i plan to not bring the players back
[5:38:03] Thdlock: no he is not LUL
[5:38:10] TheCakeBadger: LUL
[5:38:19] Kisswani: @Thdlock Mike Ybarra : " Fuck em "
[5:38:25] TheGiant99: it's sad that no matter what they do people will find ways to hate.
[5:38:27] wEiRdO_dUdE: The talents can really change the game, yeah
[5:38:29] PrimalRain: if classes feel good that's enough for most
[5:38:34] Chrizzor13: ye but it wasnt inplace , they had to make it,  its a workaround. u cant change outside of oribos @ArcaneSyntax
[5:38:35] profy0000: this is boring imo, I want new content raids and dungeons not to fly dragons and do some talents xD
[5:38:50] Sielu11628: towCopium towCopium towCopium
[5:39:02] DeanoTV: @profy0000 people have been asking for new talent trees for years
[5:39:18] Broomba: @profy0000 have you seen any alpha, beta or finished content of DF? Then you can’t say that
[5:39:19] wEiRdO_dUdE: Yeah, hardcore professions are for a minority of players (just like each of the raiding, mythic+, and PvP pillars)
[5:39:23] DeanoTV: talent trees are a big thing for alot of people
[5:39:30] Sollice: New raids and dungeons come out with every expansion….
[5:39:39] Lataran: do you think you will use the new blizz ui
[5:39:48] raddycan: !alpha
[5:39:48] Moobot: @raddycan PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:39:54] tronbadgames: @Towelliee maybe for pve
[5:39:56] Kisswani: @Sollice nah man , Dragon riding will replace all of this Kappa no new raid unfortunately
[5:39:59] ArcaneSyntax: @chrizzor13 they never said it was in place from the beginning
[5:40:10] wEiRdO_dUdE: Shifting to working on more world content can be a game changer, for sure
[5:40:19] Sollice: They going all in on that feature than bug @kisswani lol
[5:40:24] tronbadgames: @Towelliee pvp alone will have sooo many options that are viable
[5:40:28] nocigarneeded: !alpha
[5:40:28] Moobot: @nocigarneeded PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[5:40:28] DaGheyAgenda: I mean just like the old Talents itll give you a false sense of choice. When it all comes down to Single target Vs Multiple.
[5:40:47] anothermitch: Pet battle arenas would be cool
[5:40:49] Brodih_: PauseChamp
[5:40:50] stackitu: fdcig
[5:40:51] Chrizzor13: @ArcaneSyntax they did, ion said it  a beta interview, "they can pull the ripcord" its the reason for the meme
[5:40:51] Korupcija_: PauseChamp
[5:40:56] AerialAce94: @T3UST top left dude
[5:40:57] osatox: raid ST, raid AOE, raid cleave, M+ ST,  M+ AOE, M+ Cleave, PVP  , that's already 7+
[5:40:58] Rygothx: Maybe several builds like Guild Wars 2? WvW, PVP, Fractals, etc
[5:41:03] Ertra: @T3UST his stats are in the top left corner
[5:41:29] osatox: there will be ppl who min-max and go crazy with that many
[5:41:46] ZakuzaGB: you'll never get away from cooke cutter in any game really
[5:41:48] szble: Meta builds yeah
[5:41:49] wEiRdO_dUdE: There can be only one meta!
[5:41:51] osatox: and with the ability to import/export and share builds will be nice for the type of content
[5:41:51] OldManMitch: So long as it doesn’t go path of exile and make it so complex the average player taps out.
[5:41:54] Akermay: Akermay subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[5:42:05] ArcaneSyntax: @chrizzor13 go watch that interview again bro
[5:42:12] NewWorldReign: You think the Scourge are gonna be a problem in DF now that the LK is no more?
[5:42:13] Thoreya: ppl just gonna go on wowhead anyway nothing to worry about
[5:42:14] Nevindaz: KEKW
[5:42:21] falldrgn: Truth be told.. everyones gonna do either what Echo\Method do or what ever wowhead does
[5:42:33] osatox: there will be meta builds posted either on wowhead, icyveins, class discords, etc
[5:42:34] Moobot: Check out Towelliee's YouTube channel! You can view the most recent uploaded video HERE || The New Professions Systems are Game Changing! - New Dragonflight News youtu.be/iCiv-0Pvu20
[5:42:38] Nevindaz: that he taked from Sloot slootCreep
[5:43:09] grrodesu: do you think if they made old dungeons/raid acheivments available only if they add a stat squish to somewhat make them a challenge to acheiv with a group? and give the an option to run it solo with normal stats for gold farming/mount farming
[5:43:18] wEiRdO_dUdE: For sure
[5:43:21] grrodesu: would that revive old content
[5:43:22] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Rift Talent trees FeelsBadMan
[5:43:33] Sielu11628: Sub to my channel for exclusive talent builds
[5:43:42] Thdlock: Account wide ap 🙏
[5:43:44] NewWorldReign: Is the DF talent tree better than the Classic version and so forth?
[5:43:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I want to see some events happen in zones again where people have some time to get there
[5:43:58] not_pr0: and profs
[5:44:03] Ertra: its gonna happen
[5:44:05] Ertra: and you know it
[5:44:05] Kisswani: I can't imagine an expansion without WQs and Emissaries , just give me old emmissaries again and some sort of bar to fill
[5:44:13] wEiRdO_dUdE: Chasing rares only to have them dead when you get there, that sucks
[5:44:13] Akermay: Talent builds will be rampant online, there wont be a shortage of options
[5:44:16] NieIas: hope blizz makes that tos
[5:44:29] procyon_mfc: I'm returning to wow after a year hiatus - and I'm following Clickzwd lock destruction build lol with my 189 ilvl gear

[5:44:40] PvtHudson093: WQ 3.0
[5:44:40] Thdlock: idk world quests 2.0 was sick Kappa
[5:44:44] Skars111: did they say no WQ's?
[5:44:48] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Make WoW f2p, and add the TCG stuff in the shop. GG
[5:44:52] Armdel: the builds that are worthwhile will end up on wowhead anyway
[5:45:04] Crowargus: be hard to do talents for subs they change them so often ppl gunna see them on stream anyway
[5:45:07] szble: World quests are kind of tiring at this point but idk if they can be removed
[5:45:09] falldrgn: World quests in DF= Dragon tales?  lol
[5:45:12] Ashensakar: i miss the old WQs where you could find groups for the WQs with the premade finder
[5:45:12] grrodesu: if they added world content like new world that would be sick
[5:45:21] Akermay: Imagine a mini battle pass for different reps, that you level and get rewards as you go. Basically what we have, but more engaging presentation?
[5:45:26] Kisswani: I do like the ZM and Korthia weekly style of quest tho , hope that carries forward in someway
[5:45:29] mavericks312: they will get WQ's 3.0 I have faith lol
[5:45:33] procyon_mfc: @Milanesa_De_Pollo the 14.99 sub has been whats kept wow afloat for 15 years

[5:46:12] wEiRdO_dUdE: New World's world content was like the big ass turkeys
[5:46:14] falldrgn: like the bount board?

[5:48:49] ArcaneSyntax: fates are even worse than wq
[5:48:52] bluewater509: dailys
[5:48:55] SaltyAsChuck: some fates are chained together and can take a while or are rare to unlock
[5:48:56] Thdlock: beast tribe are dailies for rep
[5:48:59] CardinalTX: dailies
[5:49:00] caanan_: that was WoD wasnt it?
[5:49:00] Kisswani: like 2 minutes for 3 daily quests
[5:49:01] bluewater509: rep dailys

[5:49:35] PrimalRain: GW2 and warhammer public quests systems
[5:49:38] Nevindaz: but the thing in ffxiv is that you have only 1 character
[5:49:40] Thdlock: those rifts in argus
[5:49:44] bluewater509: Guild wars 2 imo is setup the best overall period
[5:49:45] Thdlock: man i loved the 6 hr cycle i had for those

[5:49:53] Nevindaz: yea
[5:49:55] TheSteve: @Towelliee the pre-legion invasion events were some of the best world content
[5:50:00] generaljosh721: We need another wintergrasp
[5:50:07] stratiss: GW2 stands above all and it’s not even close as far as world content
[5:50:11] Korupcija_: entering portals is cool
[5:50:21] itsindominus38: Chat how do you get those goggles he has on iron dwarf?

[5:50:48] Recruitie: argus was kinda torture tho, my sleep schedule was set around spawn timers for that zone lmao
[5:50:48] anothermitch: Tol barad again please, no more azerite mining
[5:50:52] PadidinJones: To bring back rifts we would need to reestablish the WQ/event group finder @Towelliee
[5:50:52] szble: The legion pvp towers and objs were cool
[5:50:55] svenskavelli: islands 2.0
[5:51:01] wEiRdO_dUdE: It was a pain in the ass to catch all the Legion invasions, but they were pretty awesome
[5:51:03] xendros78: leveling alts during the legion prepatch was epic

[5:51:22] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee for DF maybe in prepatch we will have something called Awakenings, and feel the ground shaking as the Dragon Isles are rising and do some kind of event
[5:51:26] Kisswani: Treasure maps can suppliment professions as well
[5:51:28] TweakT: we kneed fréshé content, stuff we havent seen or playas wont stay fo long
[5:51:28] SaltyAsChuck: I think the Warhammer public quests were pretty cool. Some of the best content is centralized public events that tons of people can just jump into it.
[5:51:29] PvtHudson093: !Alpha

[5:53:05] PrimalRain: the dragon riding may give a buff to stop that for areas you aren't supposed to access maybe?
[5:53:08] s10g0d: would be easy to ban portals, no?
[5:53:16] J_Rich94: happy to sub again

[5:53:25] Nowaayjose: They could Easily just make it so you need to be mounted to go into the portal
[5:53:29] Akermay: But most people won't be bypassing it right? So non issue?
[5:53:31] wEiRdO_dUdE: They have to make the terrain so steep that people can't gate up it
[5:53:32] PokerFaceMoose: dragon magic will block aummoning
[5:53:37] AerialAce94: probably could just block warlock portals like they did in TBC didn't they

[5:53:46] Sarocus: Could be windy up there, so you can't stand around channeling

[5:53:54] s10g0d: we can travel through time and space but dragons will stop portals lol
[5:53:54] TheHardcorian: It would be cool to have dragon pvp and conquest zones around the map you have to fly over to gain conquest points, throw spears at each other
[5:53:55] Shrenko: warlock stocks 🔼
[5:53:56] warrenny: They did that in tbcc in netherstorm right?
[5:53:57] Kisswani: I mean it's ok if you use a lock to bypass that , dont think it needs to be regulated somehow
[5:53:57] Dystilled: I mean, the tech is already there with the "banned mounting" areas. Just need to copy and paste and change it to portals

[6:03:12] procyon_mfc: is the way to sign up for the Alpha thru the Beta opt in?
[6:03:14] Dudutoolbox: yeah like who cares they'll be able to play the normal game anyway
[6:03:17] jerexify: I don't want alpha. I don't sign up for beta either. I want to play it when it's ready, not help them fix stuff that's wrong.
[6:03:19] ArcaneMaki: Damn you @Towelliee I now have that Aladdin song stuck in my head.
[6:03:20] Ertra: i live vicariously through streamers lol
[6:03:25] Laudrana: Staysafe had to put a counter on how many bugs he reported on WotLK beta for ppl to shut up about that.
[6:03:25] Sielu11628: We all have Alpha in the metaverse
[6:03:27] CardinalTX: Its like we are best friends! HahaBall
[6:03:27] mhunt2424: People reported on a daily basis for New World and nothing happened. For the most part.
[6:03:29] Crowargus: plus towelliee is pretty receptive to try she we point out
[6:03:33] Thunderbrew: By Towelliee streaming the Beta, helps me decide if I want to play Dragonflight.
[6:03:38] zemagiko: truue
[6:03:39] Funderik: there have been times where chat have pointed out problems you've missed and i've seen you report them.
[6:03:39] wEiRdO_dUdE: Oh yeah, some viewers are great at spotting things, that's true
[6:03:46] AerialAce94: Chat saved Dragon flight
[6:03:47] dutchie76: Hey Rob
[6:03:52] OigreSier: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[6:03:55] Nolimitzor: Alpha should be for streamers dunno what ppl are about ... Beta will be for mortal people like myself.
[6:03:58] BoezIRL: we just get it 2 days later
[6:03:59] dutchie76: those Yankees last night LUL
[6:04:08] AxelBirgis: Mom! I made it
[6:04:10] grimmy17: Watching towellie fumble through evoker starting zone is why we stay
[6:04:11] argonia_: Just tell me how to enter the friends and family list of blizz :D Whom should I become like cousin or something ^^
[6:04:14] Zivs: yep
[6:04:20] LiveFromStua: !alpha
[6:04:20] Moobot: @LiveFromStua PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[6:04:27] zemagiko: just a question for how many years have you be streaming wow ?
[6:04:38] Nehcrom: Don't really want alpha or beta will just play the game at launch instead.
[6:04:40] szble: I’ll settle for beta
[6:04:45] flebbooo: truue LUL For me, i either get it or i don't. Either way i'll be watching streamers anyway
[6:04:57] Sielu11628: Bring Blaine to the Dragon Isles! He’s lonely.
[6:04:58] Aveziele: people want alpha cuz this means attention of viewers, and this translates to money
[6:05:03] Cracksun98: !alpha

[6:05:04] Metrii: MH warglaive dropped in my group last night
[6:05:11] Sielu11628: Baine*
[6:05:16] Metrii: Pretty cool. I was a pug for another guild
[6:05:20] Zettabyte: Freemium
[6:05:23] PistachioIV: They still will probably do a 180º the last week of the beta and scrap most of the previous alpha and beta work LUL LUL
[6:05:28] Fafnyir: Not even free. We're paying them!
[6:05:31] oTOKEo: and free advertising
[6:05:32] xendros78: and then ignore all the feedback LUL
[6:05:38] Benjaminoo_: Or we just want something new to do, i would like an alpha but i aint one to complain about not getting one
[6:05:39] Sarocus: Gotta remember that giving Alpha to a streamer comes with the entire chat testing as well
[6:05:43] Metrii: Great point
[6:05:45] Thunderbrew: I sure don't want to test. Play for hours and hours to have the characters deleted.
[6:05:58] grimmy17: I barely watch people play Alpha, I just wanna see the icons
[6:06:14] Sielu11628: Giving Alpha/Beta to people is win-win. Players get to try expansion. Blizzard gets free testing/feedback.
[6:06:16] Thunderbrew: The Quality Assurance people take what the Streamers report and check it.
[6:06:23] PistachioIV: Do they have QA? LUL
[6:06:27] falldrgn: the QA testers see the game differently than we do.
[6:06:32] Calphurnious: Only thing I'd be testing for is finding the week 1 grind spots for epics and mounts
[6:06:44] Aveziele: @PistachioIV Q&A :D
[6:06:45] tikiwally: Starting my day off with dude spittin hard facts.
[6:06:51] Sielu11628: I can’t wait to see Asmongold break stuff
[6:06:52] Syllvn: QA is the backbone of every studio
[6:07:01] Kisswani: He'll break everything KEKW
[6:07:08] Sielu11628: towCopium towCopium
[6:07:18] Metrii: Business is interesting honestly, even in other sectors (not just gaming). The etiquette in which business practices these days is fucking poor. The pervasiveness of the type of capitalism that influences the world because of the US is ridiculous.
[6:07:21] xendros78: a lot of QA have very targeted assignments, they're given a list of stuff to test and potentially fix if they're programmers as well
[6:07:25] Zettabyte: Mom! Bathroom!
[6:07:30] thymos_: lol
[6:07:34] xendros78: content creator QA is way more broad
[6:07:35] PistachioIV: Q&A must be 1 guy on a stool then LUL
[6:07:35] NickLeonhearth: @Towelliee I honestly don't know where ppl find the energy and love to test so much, especially after a not so good exp, I love WoW ... but not that much
[6:07:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: I always get stuck in rocks  > <
[6:07:59] Thunderbrew: The funniest complaints came when Overwatch was being tested by Streamers. It was called Onlywatch. LOL
[6:08:19] VarlBGem: I like the trap holes you can't get out of.
[6:08:20] king_julian_96: toweliee do you think we will get alpha tomorrow or most liekly you date the 14th this thursday
[6:08:23] AerialAce94: Give asmon 20 min and he'll be out the map because he remembers a random toy from 10 years ago
[6:08:42] NieIas: remember in Court of stars you could run trough a wall and skip half the dungeon LUL @Towelliee
[6:09:11] Kisswani: " To whom it may concern : the day is august 7th 2022 .... "
[6:09:20] Sielu11628: @king_julian_96 He will be testing Alpha off stream Tuesday/Wednesday. Alpha for us Thursday.
[6:09:21] TweektheProphet: they need both types of testers 1 that is going to play like a relative casual and 1 that will find those exploits so it can fixed before it goes live
[6:09:26] Surader_: !ALPHA
[6:09:26] Moobot: @Surader_ PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.

[6:10:24] tronbadgames: @Towelliee not true at all
[6:10:27] Electafuzz: good guy Lore

[6:10:30] Thunderbrew: Potatoes are delicious
[6:10:33] procyon_mfc: less is more sometimes
[6:10:36] itsindominus38: @shutupRoman shut up haha
[6:10:57] Kisswani: yeah but what do they know

[6:12:10] Effin_Steffin: i got BFA Beta
[6:12:16] king_julian_96: is'nt the alpha pretty much over at that point toweliee
[6:12:20] procyon_mfc: alpha sign up is thru the beta opt in?
[6:12:26] winspeed9669: do u need to preorder to have a change to get into alpha/beta?
[6:12:34] wEiRdO_dUdE: I opted in for the Dragonflight beta during the reveal but yeah I'm probably not even on the alpha list
[6:12:38] fizxx1: Ye ye I get it, just wanted to know more cuz the site says nothing in particulare, I started playing since classic era and want to play some and remember my childhood :D ;D just left work and have some time for wow
[6:12:43] procyon_mfc: i opted in yah
[6:12:43] Moobot: Plans for WOTLK Beta. Some simple leveling and helping Blizzard test. At first there won't be a lot of people to do content with. That will change when 80 Template comes into play. OH and I don't have Beta keys ask Panda
[6:12:46] procyon_mfc: its at bottom
[6:12:48] cabalish: @procyon_mfc there is no alpha sign up , f&f only
[6:12:51] AerialAce94: alpha signups were live before you could pre-order
[6:13:11] Zolshy89: if you you have actively participated in past alpha/beta are you more likely to get in?
[6:13:14] Zolshy89: and bug report etc.
[6:13:22] fizxx1: do you know if we should have subscription to have a chance for alpha
[6:13:26] winspeed9669: thanks
[6:13:26] Moobot: We got Discord servers! Featuring giveaways, live twitter feeds, live news from Wowhead, memes, pets and more! Subs even get their own private lounge! Join HERE | discord.gg/towelliee |
[6:13:37] Exodeo_: I don't opt in as I know I'd never use the beta, rather give it to someone else
[6:13:38] thymos_: @Zolshy89 no
[6:13:39] duffluv22: I know you like to play alpha/beta for the story. Do you think they will hide the story this time and just have people test core mechanics stuff???
[6:13:48] itsindominus38: !alpha
[6:13:48] Moobot: @itsindominus38 PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[6:14:09] wEiRdO_dUdE: That is a good question, I don't know if they hide any story stuff
[6:14:17] Jakosin: @alphagunz 100% have to have sub lol
[6:14:21] Theduskflyer: !uptime
[6:14:26] itsindominus38: @Towelliee your background looks cool
[6:14:33] king_julian_96: so if alpha is this week does that mean we should get beta around mid september
[6:14:34] Zivs: @alphagunz i don't think so actually
[6:14:35] Zettabyte: Encryped shit? towCopium
[6:14:44] szble: I would think any major story points will be encrypted
[6:14:57] itsindominus38: @alphagunz 🤓 well actually!
[6:15:02] Ashensakar: probably nozdormu
[6:15:03] procyon_mfc: DF story sounds pretty straight forward.  The lead in will likely be lots of lore dump (10,000 years ago, watchers, dragons, etc.) for most early quests.
[6:15:05] TweektheProphet: what is your guess for how much we see for the 1st build of alpha
[6:15:10] Electafuzz: You gonna try Evoker first?
[6:15:18] Wigglynuts1: !alpha
[6:15:18] Moobot: @Wigglynuts1 PREDICTION JULY 14th | We are just close...like super close..ish | Quick reminder there are NO alpha keys! Alpha is invite only. Beta MIGHT have keys. We are a long ways away from Beta.
[6:15:23] BitsyOD: i think for dragon flight it might be like MOP where there wasnt one big threat more of multiple threats
[6:15:27] AerialAce94: i wouldn't mind all story stuff being encrypted honestly
[6:15:28] Thoreya: https://mobile.twitter.com/Stiven_SRB/status/1546461488457596929
[6:15:30] Mecabeast: at the very least we got the great vault as an significant improvement moving forward
[6:15:33] grrodesu: think theyre gonna bring back galakrond as a boss?
[6:15:36] Sielu11628: I can’t wait to start on the beach and climb to the peaks by the final zone
[6:15:42] wEiRdO_dUdE: Only 1 zone and 2 classes PepeHands
[6:16:02] Xsilentghost: secret testing tues and wednesday pog
[6:16:09] Calphurnious: all talents?
[6:16:12] bowsers1: jesus if there is only 1 zone znd 2 classes oh boi , forums will go crazy
[6:16:13] kimmo_gaming: Did they actually told you who the big baddie is, yes or no?
[6:16:17] Pallananana: a few cinematics atleast Kappa
[6:16:18] king_julian_96: but i thught blizzsaid are are quite far into delevopment and ahead of schedule thistime so why would they only have 1 zone available
[6:16:20] Zolshy89: PeePeeHands
[6:16:25] Bogzeh: im expecting the alpha/beta to be complete so the game can release this year :)
[6:16:32] AerialAce94: "1 class alpha, DF is not ready" - Youtube 2022
[6:16:32] SpicyFeta: What do you think about the new Dragonic Race?
[6:16:35] wEiRdO_dUdE: Them being stingy on the trees does seem like they want to make those drops last a long time
[6:16:36] grumpnamedjosh: I just really want to see what the size of the zones are gonna be
[6:16:43] Milanesa_De_Pollo: He knows PepeLaugh
[6:16:47] tronbadgames: probably old gods
[6:16:49] Zippaya: I bet you knew exact date alpha is coming out :D
[6:16:55] memnon94: its gonna be hogger

[6:17:00] tronbadgames: old gods + puppet strings = wow lore
[6:17:01] Thunderbrew: I wanna know where Khadgar is.
[6:17:01] pavepawns: big baddie is sylvanas and tyrande together
[6:17:02] Thdlock: its the dragon jailer PogBones
[6:17:05] Fnchentai: too much balancing gonna happen there is no time for big content since they are redoing all the talents and classes twiks
[6:17:05] Electafuzz: Deathwing Kappa
[6:17:10] mulkon: Damn a 3 raid last patch would be great
[6:17:13] temp3st98: corrupted alexstrasza LUL
[6:17:15] BlewGamingGroup: i dont understand why people think that the alpha is going to be the full working beta .. alpha is literally for system testing
[6:17:16] kimmo_gaming: Makes sense of course, just asking, maybe they told you like they told everyone about the Jailer LOL
[6:17:18] grrodesu: galakrond long lost brother who was in hiding now returns
[6:17:20] mulkon: 3 raids with 3~4 boss each
[6:17:24] falldrgn: its clearly KT again.. cause.. setback
[6:17:33] pavepawns: what about Lifewing?
[6:17:34] Zivs: @Thunderbrew there is a 'stay awhile and listen' with Khadgar and Jaina in Oribos in 9.2.5
[6:17:39] BitsyOD: Shadow of deathwing boss fight im calling it
[6:17:40] tronbadgames: @Towelliee totally - thats part of the new race lore right? death wing
[6:17:43] Sielu11628: I can 100% see Deathwing not being dead
[6:17:44] Kisswani: maybe in the evoker starting zone we'll see deathwing
[6:17:50] PokerFaceMoose: they are just going to reuse the dragon soul raid
[6:17:56] Sielu11628: Would explain the failure of Dragon Soul
[6:18:08] AerialAce94: daddy death wing
[6:18:19] BlewGamingGroup: they might even send out an email to testers to all try to log in at a certain time just to test the login server(s)
[6:18:29] procyon_mfc: hey how do you unlock flying in SL?
[6:18:29] jerexify: It's Hogger. He's the big baddie. He's a physical incarnation of all the Old Gods, and he's come to strike his revenge.
[6:18:30] Fnchentai: a dungeons spirit
[6:18:31] temp3st98: maybe just like how demon hunter starting zone was
[6:18:32] flebbooo: Yeeees!
[6:18:35] Milanesa_De_Pollo: Like an Occulus style dragon fight

[6:18:41] flebbooo: Avatar of Neltharion
[6:18:49] king_julian_96: but i thought blizz said they are quite far into development and ahead of schedule this time so why would they only have 1 zone available
[6:18:51] wEiRdO_dUdE: Tentacle dragons!
[6:18:53] Kisswani: maybe the elementals will find a way to ress him
[6:18:54] ceranac23: deathwing so shit fight xD
[6:18:56] szble: Idk probably just see him in old lore flashbacks
[6:19:05] Electafuzz: I don't want to be his back scratcher again
[6:19:10] Zivs: @king_julian_96 targeted testing
[6:19:12] Mecabeast: maybe a mini fight with onyxia and netharion
[6:19:16] grimmy17: Maybe Evoker starter zone will be like exiles reach and we fight his spirit at the end in a mini dungeon
[6:19:20] fillefaren: why exactly would we fight deathwing again_
[6:19:20] Kisswani: The Bronze Dragon flght is here , we can whatever in the past
[6:19:24] Pallananana: They did go full anime in dragon soul, that much is true KEKW
[6:19:27] Zettabyte: Deathwing redemption arc Kappa
[6:19:30] grimmy17: @imbadkekw Because dragons
[6:19:31] szble: More likely to see sinestra
[6:19:38] OigreSier: that's because deathwing is huge
[6:19:42] grimmy17: Sinestra zzzzzzzzzzzz
[6:19:53] Zanzarful: A different timeline Deathwing is the one who woke up the dragon isles again
[6:19:55] Zanzarful: KEKW
[6:19:57] 0doz: all wow dragons in one instance.. D:
[6:20:00] warrenny: What if he made the evokers and its similar to dh where theres a time skip
[6:20:06] Thunderbrew: Dragon Soul was my first raid.
[6:20:06] Electafuzz: "idk cuz dragons" LUL
[6:20:14] BitsyOD: they technically gave us a arthas boss fight with anduin
[6:20:16] AerialAce94: im still waiting for the "we wake up and its all a dream" ending to SL
[6:20:19] PokerFaceMoose: you're going to have to fight death wings influence on his son.
[6:20:21] Kisswani: @warrenny that's what I was thinking
[6:20:21] Ashensakar: is Khadgar back?
[6:20:21] Nolimitzor: Also Gul'dan wasn't killed ... so he might revive Galakrond
[6:20:23] grimmy17: I mean they've said there's a time skip
[6:20:25] Wigglynuts1: archeology must make a comeback
[6:20:34] Fnchentai: why do i feel like we gonna get wraithion as the last villain since it's all his fault that the legion did come to azeroth
[6:20:35] grimmy17: We wake up on the island when the lights turn back on
[6:20:48] HaxzorJimDuggan: galakrand caverns of time raid, we have to help throw the rock that gets stuck in his throat LUL
[6:20:55] warrenny: Do time walking as frost forget to pick takents /facepalm
[6:20:58] TweektheProphet: I can see have a flashback with deathwing
[6:21:03] szble: Some more elune stuff would be cool
[6:21:06] pavepawns: can we get wrathion as a mount
[6:21:07] pavepawns: just saying
[6:21:10] Dungorr: there wasnt Arthas in shadowlands
[6:21:16] Hypertitan: wrathion has magnificent hair...he can't be a villain
[6:21:16] Mecabeast: I low key want ebon horn to be leader instead
[6:21:18] Rudric_Ice: didn't they say they will bring back neltharions cave from legion back for evoker or something ??
[6:21:19] Hypertitan: it's against the rules
[6:21:20] flebbooo: As long as he doesn't help us get a legendary cloak again LUL
[6:21:20] AerialAce94: i think the dragon Isle's is the same island as the island from Lost
[6:21:20] Sielu11628: @pavepawns agreed
[6:21:22] pavepawns: we got alexstraza so why not wrathion as a mount
[6:21:36] jerexify: Any reason you're working on an Alliance Paladin? Or just looking for something to do?
[6:21:44] Fnchentai: more like getting possesed by deathwing as he was his father expirement and used as a vessal avatar for his father
[6:21:49] thymos_: W OMEGALUL O
[6:21:59] temp3st98: we probably have it like mop
[6:22:02] temp3st98: get
[6:22:06] thymos_: that was supposed to be a who :)
[6:22:07] TheCheeseWheel87: that would be awesome
[6:22:14] Sielu11628: I wouldn’t mind legendary gear drops like Classic from bosses, or a quest line like Shadowmourne
[6:22:45] Sielu11628: 11.0 towCopium
[6:22:45] Electafuzz: Make relic quests new artifact skins?
[6:22:51] Bogzeh: cool artifact wep like skins for an expansion long relic quest
[6:23:00] kimmo_gaming: @Towelliee We dont know if there would be legos in DF right?
[6:23:30] DallTV_: xD
[6:23:30] grimmy17: @kimmo_gaming Think they said no
[6:23:39] BitsyOD: I think an expedition type quests would work. you go do some quests in a zone were u can see what has happened since classic sort of like exploring azeroth but ingame @Towelliee
