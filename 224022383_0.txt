Broken classes, you can't just tag something and run away you have to be in group to get credit. You have to really level professions do quests for them so yea... its' gonna be horrible. y'all won't last!

[0:38:11] Starstorki: Could be hard doing 10v10 pvp? Bu you're forcing PVE players to muster 20man for mythic. Bring back 10man raiding, and force *** to rate 10 man and 2 man. LIsten to the need of the common player, instead of the "pros"
