[2:32:51] hlachezarov: @Funderik yes you are popping in m0 because trash dies in 10 seconds. it doesnt work that way in end game content
[2:33:03] Jarlan23: @dmune96 i havent seen any ranks anywhere
[2:33:07] TheZander: yeah but after that initial burst window you deal legit less damage than tanks

[7:08:59] xstraightbrutal: @dotgrix yeah. its my first time goin melee. ive always dabbeled with enhance. but im legit enhance main now. so im doin my research. but if youre the only enhance shammy, then more than likely youll have to take it for your raid team unless youre that "my sub my playstyle" guy

[7:10:48] darkkilla1: FF14 damage meters are banned but not banned. you can have them and run them but if you also can get banned if you try to be toxic about dps
[7:10:48] Scorpiris_Junoh: Yea streamers got bant for showing off meters
[7:10:48] A_New_Challenger: Things were great...I think they should just have a vote to kill prot warrior option in dungeons...let them go, but if the team says stop :)
[7:10:49] key__lime__pie: Are BM hunters anygood?

[7:10:51] Vuntrei: Oh, when I played people were always like "DON"T TALK ABOUT IT REEEE"
[7:10:58] Kasaiya13: FF players can use them as long as they don't be toxic shits with it, Yoshi has said so loads of times, be an ass about it and he'll ban
[7:11:00] Rolaj: The main rule with Meters in FF14 is "don't call people out, dont be a dick" its the gray area where FF14 doesnt "allow" them but wont really enforce unless you're a dick about it
[7:11:00] TheNightfyre: People that base their fun off a damage meter... lame
[7:11:05] BrokeDance: rip
[7:11:06] Thunder4o: @darkkilla1 Balance wouldnt matter if Raids and dungeons were like FF14,made so easy and boring none would care which one is doing more dmg

[7:12:46] sw4rml0gic: having specs right at the bottom who can play their very best and be beneath a middling other class - would you not consider that a failing in balance on Blizzard's part?
[7:12:47] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @osteoidtitan56 (warning)

[7:12:53] StylishBart: I use the meters to make fun of my friends "oh, this is the boss where your hunter ran out of ammo"

[7:23:57] OriginalAllure: It's been 3 days since I was awarded pet and mount and I still don't have it in game. How long does it usually take?
[7:24:16] s_t_o_r_m__: lmao
[7:24:18] DeadlyBond: @OriginalAllure Instant
[7:24:21] DoughBoi_Trev: so the answer is NERF the cost of mats and shit for the 2%ers benefit.... interesting
[7:24:22] dr_dre20: Does anyone know a good place for me to learn how to use a Havoc DH?
[7:24:24] Cower311: GREAT NOW IM BRICKED UP
[7:24:25] Demvacco: I would have done my profession point way different if I had known more about them

[7:24:45] 3ncode: @OriginalAllure I got my fel drake yesterday - so it could takes weeks.
[7:24:50] Kebabra_: @OriginalAllure How you checked the mount and pet journal? They don't get mailed to you
[7:24:51] dannyis1337: they need to make work orders cross server like the AH
[7:24:51] FeelFeelson: Oh I have plenty of work orders from recipes that don’t exist in the game yet
[7:25:07] jasonbriggs: @OriginalAllure have you claimed them on the claims page
[7:25:11] TheRiwen: I just like so we can reset the knowledge
[7:25:14] Saucy722: I'm confused though
[7:25:15] Hamners: there is a learning curve with workorders aswell
[7:25:15] s_t_o_r_m__: yeah crafting is for everone
[7:25:19] Broomba: the 2%
[7:25:22] ImSteveHi: nope
[7:25:23] Milenkan: 95% of the orders on my server for LW are for Iskaar renown 29 -_-
[7:25:27] SIN0044: lol ikr
[7:25:28] Broomba: thats like 2% milk
[7:25:29] TheChiefOfBeef: Think I missed it, what is the problem with crafting rn?
[7:25:35] idenkaz_: barerly and workorders on my server if any
[7:25:36] CasualR: I completed a work order once that wasn't from a guildie. that was neat. once
[7:25:37] Zenyix: Farmed glowing titan orbs for 3 hours yesterday...got enough to make a single devotion enchant feels super bad
[7:25:39] LoremasterMarthan: Everyone fulfilling work orders for weekly are just posting them on alts currently lol
[7:25:40] DoughBoi_Trev: Tier 2 mats cost more than tier 3 mats
[7:25:42] Saucy722: the rank 3 mats are like 20k... and it upgrades to 418. the mythic BOE's from raid are normally a couple M gold? How is this any worse?
[7:25:43] ImSteveHi: i love watching this stream because @Towelliee keeps it 100 no matter what
[7:25:44] TheNoidd: nerfing it hurts crafters tho. there needs to be some kind of barrier in order for it to be viable for gold making
[7:25:46] Kittsuera: i got lots of stuff via work orders. you save decent amount on stuff that would normally cost far more
[7:25:48] LoremasterMarthan: There is no need for crafting orders this early in the expansion
[7:26:02] Thorkiil: im looking for a rank 4 crafter and i think ppl are doing the same.

[7:26:39] Azurall47: also recepies
[7:26:53] Scoodles91: people use the orders, but also ppl complete the orders in a min, so you dont see many up at a time
[7:26:54] LoremasterMarthan: Give the work order system more than 2 or 3 weeks into the expansion for stuff to actual start circulating
[7:26:55] zeeAbe: The people who make gold on work orders spend 8 hours per day spamming tradechat, such interactive and fun gameplay btw
[7:26:55] abracka_: i've just been farming mats heavy with mining/herb. can usually make around 20-30k gold per hour
[7:26:57] jcav209: How do you level up leatherworking I’m stuck at 19
[7:26:58] thebius: i believe most crafting orders are failing because they require you to use your spark of ingenuity which is timegated and many people doesnt seem to want to use it
[7:26:59] master_brewslee: Ive made bank as a tailor through work orders
[7:27:00] SinicalDev: On my server the only work orders that are up are stuff for recipes at 19 renown or from the raid
[7:27:00] WhoIsAndrewJ: Obsidian farm - sell the signets -
[7:27:02] Updul: I only made 800k with the ordersystem
[7:27:06] OriginalAllure: omg I'm an idiot. I had previously purchased the pet and mount in the shop so i already had them......i'm a douchenozzle.
[7:27:09] Azurall47: 100k+ for cooking recepies for example atm
[7:27:11] idenkaz_: recipes dropping from rares is bad design im sorry
[7:27:14] master_brewslee: i can make the 2 set for chronos and azure cloth set

[7:28:10] Lostdogal: Crafting is always a trap, even when I saw the new system I was like, nope, two gathering professions to sell shit in AH is still th eway.
[7:28:15] raldrik: easier fix is to just not make gathering a major profession. Let us all gather. That will give more mats into the economy and lower prices

[7:29:12] Hamners: I like that about professions though
[7:29:14] VanishSHRoguE: @Towelliee don't forget though you have buffs @ 10 and 20 for renowned rep for alts
[7:29:15] Felric_DH: what sucks is, some professions have more recipes for gaining knowledge than others
[7:29:19] hickey7979: i use to do all profs
[7:29:20] master_brewslee: the grind isnt to bad with the 100% renown buff
[7:29:22] Hamners: and the rewards should be great
[7:29:25] slimoby: having that be the grind is a really good thing imo
[7:29:26] ClassicMalcontent: Renown Grind for Professions so it's really more anti-casual in that aspect.
[7:29:26] LoremasterMarthan: and not for nothing, arguably the best option to come out of the background combating of crafting/gathering bots
[7:29:31] Prophecy67: Professions are just a more advanced goldsink to be fair
[7:29:31] jasonbriggs: they should allow you too have 2 crafting prof and 1 gathering prof
[7:29:34] CatsRusOfficial: They are the grind of this system, but it isnt required. it only feels required because its the most game hasnt unlocked yet.

[7:29:46] gordon_love: @Hamners I agree

[7:30:00] TheNoidd: if they swing too far the other way they'll ruin it so i hope they are careful and incremental
[7:30:04] akia03: but how many people will be crafting in 2 weeks
[7:30:08] ClassicMalcontent: @jwalch97 yes I've been hoping and wanting Account Wide rep and renown for ages.
[7:30:09] Crizzle777: There are no crafting orders on my server, I can't progress my blacksmithing
[7:30:10] DeanoTV: @3ncode trueee
[7:30:21] Dox023: Yeah if your main has high renown then your alts gain 200% more rep to 10 and 100% more rep to 20. I could see that helping a ton.
[7:30:21] LoremasterMarthan: If they are going to adjust anything, I would assume it will be a way to "respec" points for people who didn't understand the system
[7:30:26] akia03: when they have m+ arena and raid for gear
[7:30:36] ClassicMalcontent: You're the same person why separate characters? Renown and Rep long overdue account wide.
