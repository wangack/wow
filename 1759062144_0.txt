[0:30:28] WytChapp: xD
[0:31:02] ClockworkZen: @SinicalDev It's probably something to this effect. 10.1 featurette to build hype along with a 10.0.7 release date
[0:31:05] Anthy1887: big news is towelliee has cookies for chat danDrool

[0:33:03] Molvonos: We're getting Starcraft Ghost finally, bet
[0:33:19] Shrenko: @Kneckt I still rely on my prediction that is it something related with 10.1. Streamers and wow content creators posting GIFs of Deathwing and land mass changes feels like something will happen with Azeroth once again!
[0:33:19] Crowargus: na patch related for sure blizz released a developer build on ptr yesterday
[0:33:20] Kneckt: It’s deff more than just a patch date etc etc something big happening it seems
[0:33:57] Kneckt: @shrenko could argue that is more than just a typical patch tho :p

[0:39:26] cheetalol: @hoghad it is almost sure towellie gets a world of warcraft hammer tattoo ion his left cheek
[0:39:42] Shrenko: I would assume if it was something huge Blizzard would have some sort of a headsup like '' tune in to this date , this time etc. '' . My guess is that some content creators had access to the encrypted 10.1 build, made videos out of it, showing us today the new zone and stuff that is coming

[1:42:15] goldenarmz414: only bad i can think about is respecing azerite armor for the 5th time a week
[1:42:20] opalwinfrey: WoD tho.. that was bad
[1:42:20] Sandisy: bfa was great if you played the entire expansion. if you missed a patch it was a struggle to catch up

[1:42:25] Wulfgrym: bfa was the last expansion i played full time and loved the dungeons

[3:46:06] Cheapesttactics1: I'm hearing colts
[3:46:09] TinmanFPS: @Towelliee who do you want the colts to take in the draft? I think Stroud would be a good fit
[3:46:11] Bawpears: Didn't he get franchise tagged?
[3:46:23] Evenuno: I've heard Atlanta
[3:46:25] Texas_Mizfit: yes
[3:46:26] Kaldris8151: Commanders beat reporter said no way.   Better not be the Colts.
[3:46:26] Keglett: ah fuck, why did he have to be in the same division as the eagles
[3:46:28] haveachub: commanders dont have the cap space lol
[3:46:32] micker1015: !yt

[3:46:38] DiiscoViking: comanders... such a crap name choice
[3:46:38] royhandlesit: Pittsburgh
[3:46:45] jinnchu: @Bawpears non-exclusive tag, so hes talking to other teams to try to get the deal he wants
[3:47:01] Evenuno: He got tagged, but it's 2 first rounders to get in talks to get Lamar. Which Atlanta would pay
[3:47:12] Ovium56: Yeah he can still talk with teams to negotiate a deal
[3:47:13] PvtHudson093: anything happened yet?
[3:47:16] Kaldris8151: Yeah. That's why, as a Colts, fan, I don't want him either. Injuries. He's been in decline since his MVP season in 2019.   I'd rather get a rookie QB to develop.
[3:47:18] Wulfgrym: I rather take Garoppolo over Jackson
[3:47:18] TinmanFPS: I dont think they should take Bryce, stroud would be a good fit for the new offense
[3:47:30] RAF_Sean: How much of those injuries happened because of their garbage tier training staff tho
[3:47:31] Kipagami: injury prone sounds exactly like what the Commanders look for Kappa

[3:47:42] Betrys: commanders are not expected to pursue lamar
[3:47:48] Wulfgrym: @Kipagami lol
[3:47:49] TinmanFPS: Jimmy G is one of the old heads now lmao
[3:48:17] Wulfgrym: at least Jimmy G been to the superbowl more than Jackson

[3:48:34] Evenuno: Jimmy G is going to Vegas
[3:48:39] jinnchu: @Bawpears Yeah, hes talking to other teams. He will bring a deal to the Ravens and they can either match it or decline it and get two 1st round picks
[3:48:40] kappaday23: Keepo
[3:48:44] TinmanFPS: I got my season tix lined up in Indy this year im pumped
[3:49:00] PieceOfPanic: +2 ? EZ
[3:49:03] Betrys: commanders, falcons, raiders and panthers are not going for lamar jackson
[3:49:12] PadidinJones: its true
[3:49:18] WytChapp: Get slapped and they fall in plate aromour
[3:49:22] Hizuru1: TRUE
[3:49:27] theDirtyon3: Locks take offense to that
[3:49:29] Ertra: gg
[3:49:33] michaelmm: Ret feels like it's wearing wet tissue paper ATM.
[3:49:35] Wulfgrym: yeah all the pally tanks just sititng back giddy for the ret buffs
[3:49:36] LoseAlotLuke: sneeze on a plate wearer and they nearly die
[3:49:40] t1mbstone: remember when ret pally was the absolute shit, what happened man :(
[3:49:41] theDirtyon3: Locks are WAYYYY tankier than pallys KEKW
[3:49:41] ottavianni: whats ur opinion about owners colluding to not give lamar a full garanted contract ?
[3:49:43] Kaldris8151: @TinmanFPS Nice. Hoping the Colts find the right pieces this year. Can't wait for Shaq to get back. Him and Franklin.
[3:49:47] juicefermilk: coming from a sham main to a pally.. they are not squishy LUL
[3:49:53] MisterD1rty: its really bad for MM hunters
[3:49:58] PieceOfPanic: I mean. out of 2 tanks with a shield, u'd think Prot pally be less prone to heavy hits.
[3:50:03] PadidinJones: They are like soccer players with the fake injury
[3:50:14] Wulfgrym: full guarantee contracts for QBs was a nuts in the first place

[3:50:23] TinmanFPS: @TinmanFPS Colts just need the O line and QC to get right, defense was solid last season
[3:50:28] TinmanFPS: QB*
[3:50:38] Massacr3_RC: Bryce gonna be good even if a tad small
[3:50:40] fewyn: you want stroud imo
[3:50:43] Cheapesttactics1: You think they will trade up?
[3:50:46] mavericks312: nah colts gonna get lamar and trade there draft away lol
[3:51:07] wEiRdO_dUdE: Mastery gives consecrate reduction
[3:51:08] Massacr3_RC: @mavericks312 I could see that happening, the weird collusion happening with Lamar is sus lmao
[3:51:08] Kaldris8151: I'm hoping for Stroud. I think he's the main target for the Colts. He's got what Steichen is looking for.
[3:51:10] Evenuno: Chris Ballard doesn't trade up
[3:51:18] RocketMan23: they always run holy shield
[3:51:19] mavericks312: levis has bust written all on him
[3:51:30] MisterD1rty: Stroud entering the draft?
[3:51:41] mavericks312: @Massacr3_RC pending on what years the 1st rd picks are for id love the falcons to get him but at a good cost
[3:51:43] inerix94: Why no sentinel?
[3:51:44] PieceOfPanic: Daaaamn
[3:51:54] TinmanFPS: @MisterD1rty Yeah
[3:52:07] PieceOfPanic: That's crazy
[3:52:09] pixlbunz: Tbh he is also 417ilvl so there is that
[3:52:35] TinmanFPS: Need the colts to take stroud and then tank again next year and get Harrison Jr
[3:52:41] pixlbunz: At 417 no matter what gonna pump
[3:52:55] brabblesauce: talents again?

[3:53:07] Evenuno: Richardson should have gone back
[3:53:09] Cheapesttactics1: U like Pittman jr?
[3:53:24] mavericks312: who does stroud have to throw too if he does get drafted
[3:53:33] Wulfgrym: I don't see any team giving Jackson a full guarantee contract, Watson contract is worst mistake and the whole league knows it
[3:53:37] chrisrev: can i join your group for raid finder?
[3:53:37] Boggogroggo: I'll come do raid finder with you, try to ease the pain
[3:53:39] pixlbunz: Lol tow goin into some lfg books
[3:53:45] Gragnar: any reason he does lfr diurna+raz? ring + raz "mount"?
[3:54:00] TinmanFPS: A Stud TE would help the colts too
[3:54:01] Kaldris8151: Pittman Jr is great. Even with our bad QB play in 2022, Pittman was almost at 1k yards.
[3:54:07] ButterStains: is 10.0.7 coming next week geistiCracked
[3:54:08] eyemyor: Who do the bears trade to?
[3:54:09] mavericks312: maybe the colts do something smart and trade for d-hop
[3:54:09] snake_like: he likes pain
[3:54:11] Evenuno: Adam Thielen may be available
[3:54:15] Effin_Steffin: Lamar to the Bay!
[3:54:17] Ovium56: Feel bad for A Robinson. Teams get him and just do nothing with him
[3:54:23] ButterStains: defofpCracked please say yes
[3:54:28] Gragnar: fun is a fiiine reason
[3:54:32] PieceOfPanic: So high chance of block, but still prone to the physical damage itself. Would that be correct?

[3:58:32] pixlbunz: @Towelliee you think we'll ever get a Dracthyr tank?
[3:58:39] snake_like: vault is definitely lower difficulty but man...progging for 3 months every tier just burns my soul

[4:58:04] Hizuru1: What a joke
[4:58:26] PieceOfPanic: Yea, the fake renown timegate doesn't feel good..

[4:59:36] Nokterian: my renown is so low i dont if i ever get it to max
[4:59:39] Dcarter: That is a smart cadence
[4:59:44] ButterStains: It would be way too much all at once to drop at the same time
[4:59:45] Dcarter: Let’s the patch come
[5:00:09] Hizuru1: Sadge
[5:00:11] Effin_Steffin: we sure Freehold is faster than Neltharus?

[5:05:52] 3dRes: Towelliee has become notes man
[5:05:57] Cello_73: you mean he gets the Triple A Map Books
[5:06:00] Masqerader: map quest, none of u have a map book, ffs
[5:06:02] Arocian: mapquest, AAA flip book travel pack
[5:06:12] angahax: are they gonna let horde and alliance trade with each other?
[5:06:15] hammack52: while cross faction guilds is something that people want im going keep it real and say that i will believe it when i see it on live servers
[5:06:17] Armdel: id prefer swapping to nelf, but with that pricetag...
[5:06:20] Effin_Steffin: RIP Worgen
[5:06:21] ashwing_: Theres gonna be min-maxing from the 1% with the races for sure
[5:06:21] GingerGambit: Can we finally queue cross faction for dungeons?
[5:06:21] drewetling: maps on paper are fun and kinda hippster
[5:06:22] Dritharian: Does that mean we'll get to actually que with the other faction?
[5:06:24] Daggerstry: So how will Hall of Fame and RWF work since you still can't mix factions until HoF is over

[5:06:39] brewgamingtv: Keep 8
[5:06:40] LoseAlotLuke: 10.1 after diablo 4? late june @Towelliee
[5:06:43] reggiepowa: I feel like 8 is good only for first patch, 10 should be the norm
[5:06:50] Molvonos: @Sollice Yea, but you have to play alliance.  Not worth.
[5:06:54] COGBLOCKERR: 8 is good
[5:06:54] EmpathyLiveChat: I'm not sure I want those Horde types at my guild meetings. Think of the smell...
[5:06:58] hammack52: the season was 2 4 6

[5:07:01] Crowargus: more alliance now night elves n dwarves for plus gunna see sick strats
[5:07:05] GingerGambit: Vault is 2 4 6
[5:07:10] angahax: @Towelliee are they gonna let you trade between factions?
[5:07:11] Sollice: @Sollice I refuse to play tauren or troll because of feet
[5:07:12] brewgamingtv: 10 is annoying. 8 is a good progress number
[5:07:20] Dcarter: Hof is just one
[5:07:22] reggiepowa: it will still be 2/4/6 probably
[5:07:28] Djfarmville: currently 2-4-6

[5:07:44] Arocian: alliance horde link auction houses
[5:07:44] Dcarter: Now I don’t know if I’ll go troll or mechagnome
[5:07:46] fewyn: i assume you will be able to? if you are a cross faction guild
[5:07:47] magemaster225: you can already do that
[5:07:48] marineboi1288: why not just do the boss count like ulduar lmao
[5:07:53] Cello_73: how about communication between factions
[5:07:53] raldrik: wonder if they will combine the AH
[5:07:59] ButterStains: Can we whisper/talk to Allies now?
[5:08:03] Molvonos: @Dcarter You dont hate yourself enough to go Mechagnome
[5:08:04] Ponickz: AH?
[5:08:04] barrowzz: Maybe if they are guild member cause how do you pass out pots etc or just make everybody responsible I guess withdraw from guild bank
[5:08:08] shiftfazed: you can in dungeons
[5:08:08] Murlock07: good question
[5:08:10] Arocian: can I go chill in org as human?
[5:08:13] Masqerader: on AH we can
[5:08:16] Rottencoarse: @Towelliee  if you're in the same server maybe?
[5:08:17] Aidler: If you are in a guild together you need to be able to trade

[5:08:43] limburgse: you cant whisper cross faction randomly atm
[5:08:46] ottavianni: If now u can in dung why would be different in raid
[5:08:49] Ant_0420: i can give gold an items from one faction to another now
[5:08:50] kaeildk: @Towelliee the more important question, can I send mail to my alliance chars in 10.1?

[5:08:54] Boggogroggo: anduin recreates arthas soul
[5:08:57] MereMortal: Alliance villain arc was revealed with VanCleef
[5:08:59] Amarlian: I feel, if they are ready to release cross faction guilds in 10.1, they have something major solved about it
[5:09:05] Sollice: Which is why they want it tested
[5:09:07] Cello_73: thats true @limburgse  just curious on like guild recruiting, etc
[5:09:08] Arocian: no kidding, can horde alliance now understand each other in say and general chat?
[5:09:11] Hizuru1: just 2 cent overhyped it
[5:09:15] raldrik: cross faction guilds means we will never go back so Alliance vs Horde it really limits their storytelling
[5:09:18] Ponickz: Well do it LIVE
[5:09:31] SuperLost89: i have a second PTR that says 10.1

[5:19:45] DiiscoViking: priest is so legit
[5:19:46] drewetling: time to joing the foot clan

[5:20:08] YinYangMan77: Elaborate
[5:20:14] Molvonos: They're prolly based off the Aspect mount in the store.
[5:20:15] hammack52: this is so fucked the evoker set (for a class you cant even see there armor for 95% of the time} looks better then the hunter set
[5:20:15] Masqerader: you know what they need to do.  Make it so if you say clear heroic you get the normal, lfr mog and if u clear mythic you get them all
[5:20:17] Mecabeast: That reminds me of the store mount
[5:20:18] ButterStains: @bearsmack They should just make the shoulders smaller but even then. The one giant shoulder is odd
[5:20:21] Gremaldy: Yup, they need to fire them all
[5:20:22] marineboi1288: is there a new KSM mount?
[5:20:24] Nutqase: i wonder if they will loose players because of cross faction guilds or not
[5:20:27] Big_Snarly: I'm kinda hoping therer'll be purple colors for dragonriding mount skins.
[5:20:29] Derca_: reminds me of pandaria serpent mounts
[5:20:30] Digidan2005: cloud serpent-esque model
[5:20:36] Hizuru1: hope it walks on ground
[5:20:36] MMokuin: So in 10.1 i can walk in SW as horde? Kappa
[5:20:45] ButterStains: I love that
[5:20:48] BigBoxx91: Do you think we’ll be able to ride these dragons as normal mounts when dragon riding isn’t a thing anymore?
[5:20:54] Red_Dead_Redeem: where is the pink rainbow mount? Kappa
[5:20:58] Murlock07: lol

[5:21:13] Frostfury: KEKW
[5:21:14] HaxzorJimDuggan: his face when tuskarr becomes an allied race
[5:21:15] Fawcheddar: The affix changes are so bad. I hope they listen to feedback
[5:21:15] ButterStains: Including more model types in dragon riding just takes us closer to dragon riding throughout Azeroth
[5:21:24] Masqerader: why their a xmas tree lol
[5:21:27] Zivs: MrGMs video is really well made imo

[5:22:29] wEiRdO_dUdE: The affix changes are good, yeah
[5:22:29] marcuusjj: seasonal was the best tho
[5:22:30] Arocian: you ask you shall receive
[5:22:30] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah I'm fine with 2 affixes and not all that other crap until they figure it out
[5:22:32] verentnarv: do we have a 10.0.7 release date yet with this new info?
[5:22:33] Sarcastard: Morgan: Then, we're really taking a closer look at the level 7 bucket and how much opportunity is there for counterplay. How much of that is making your healer's life harder versus how much of that is there an opportunity where if I play really well, I can negate this affix and use my utility really well or whatever it may be. So we're definitely taking a look at the whole level 7 bucket, so really more along the lines of an affix refresh for that bucket, as well no level 10 affix.
[5:22:34] Hebrewish012: they literally listened to feedback that's impressive
[5:22:36] Hizuru1: Difference between Legion it was harder
[5:22:38] DarkIntentz: We wanted 2.5 affixes
[5:22:39] Hizuru1: and DF is meme
[5:22:42] wernou: Where can we see tier sets??
[5:22:44] ButterStains: I liked thundering, am I the only one?
[5:22:52] biirrd: was there not the reverse we like to see.. only a season one?
[5:22:55] Masqerader: the legion seasonal was dumb as fuck in SL
[5:23:00] derry10: grevious
[5:23:01] dreamwalker213: @butterstains yes
[5:23:03] stabzmcgeee: wanted positive affixs not all negative
[5:23:05] brewgamingtv: Thundering is dogshit
[5:23:05] Masqerader: was the most pointless useless seasonal ever
[5:23:10] abracka_: there are some real hot garbage takes in chat here and there lmao
[5:23:14] Vallonze: @ButterStains yes
[5:23:14] Defocus: remove quaking please

[5:23:43] wernou: Plz*
[5:23:43] MereMortal: Yeah, positive affixes were what a lot of the discussion was about
[5:23:48] ButterStains: lol it would appear it was just me then

[5:24:11] dracullus: it begins
[5:24:14] Sollice: Just let them remove it for a season and let them readjust and come up with new ideas
[5:24:25] Sollice: There is no point in pushing out another seasonal affix just because
[5:24:25] Red_Dead_Redeem: typical wow players LUL
[5:24:30] Nokterian: No seasonal affix is GOOD
[5:24:32] MereMortal: All the affixes suck honestly
[5:24:35] mavericks312: this is why they dont listen to players lol
[5:24:36] ZeusDNA: I'm excited to see all the changes
[5:24:37] Odinslayer: dude i hate explosives and quacking more than thundering
[5:24:38] Hebrewish012: I'm happy with this seems good
[5:24:39] Heero_Effect: I mean I like the seasonal affix, thundering just was meh.
[5:24:39] TheGiant99: @heero_effect awesome answer thanks for your input

[5:24:45] Molvonos: They want a seasonal affix that summons a bunch of critters that follow you.
[5:24:45] dracullus: less cheese! more macaroni! more cheese! I hate macaroni and cheese
[5:24:47] Digidan2005: bring back reaping :)
[5:24:51] EdgeOfTwilight: I dont think the seasonal affix was the problem tho, kinda saddins me that its gone
[5:24:53] Red_Dead_Redeem: yeah I'm happy with it
[5:24:54] brewgamingtv: I’m excited for season 2
[5:24:55] Defocus: bring back reaping affix with the new ret rework
[5:24:57] Nokterian: Legion style m+ thank god
[5:25:06] BurtMacklin410: So this whole currency thing...Are they making raid gear upgradable it sounds like?
[5:25:06] Masqerader: just bring back encrypted all we need
[5:25:06] abracka_: can we get a petition going to swap the paladin and priest tier sets
[5:25:07] TheYosim: Big props on the interview, you did great.  Really good questions
[5:25:16] reggiepowa: generally seasonal affixes were great, other affixes sucked. i wanted seasonal affix to stay
[5:25:18] Shrenko: Just got here… did they show a new zone?

[5:25:42] PvtHudson093: Harlan's loaded dice are back for agi users
[5:25:43] Theduskflyer: I think the 10+ affix are fine. They could be better sure. The 5+ and 7+ need re worked, as well as placed properly.
[5:25:43] Masqerader: the new upgrade system in 10.1 looks nice too
[5:25:46] Foretoldlegends: Honestly the buff from thundering wasn't bad but the punish for some people not clearing felt to much of a gambit. Like have it be a two second stun and I think Thundering would have been fine.
[5:25:48] MereMortal: "I don't think." - Towelliee 2023 Kappa
[5:25:53] stabzmcgeee: seasonal affixs gave us something positive, instead of just being punished

[5:46:26] reggiepowa: yeah thats way too long
[5:46:32] oldmcstabbin: Combining the factions is what every mmo does in its death throws. They should have fixed those unbalanced raicals... Who else but blizzard??
[5:46:35] basementdwellingvirginx: @Towelliee WTF is the SV hunter rework spec makes no sense and has athe worst talent tree lol...?
[5:46:45] DudeInARobe: I can't do 3-4 months of these current dungeons and affixes lol 23's are ridiculous atm to time

[5:46:57] james_bah: july would be worse than shadowland
[5:46:57] MereMortal: It'll be ok thought I think. Diablo IV doesn't release every quarter.
[5:47:00] flebbooo: can we expect 10.0.7 for next week?
[5:47:02] its____rooster: i like a may or june release
[5:47:09] Sicknessqt: 2 months testing, early may release ?
[5:47:10] SpyCrabbo: @oldmcstabbin tf are you talking about

[5:47:19] Vendralos: New Gear upgrading system coming?
[5:47:22] theDirtyon3: gib plz
[5:47:33] oldmcstabbin: @Sollice they are combining the factions you must have missed the memo.
[5:47:33] flebbooo: oh okay thanks!
[5:47:39] Moobot: No need to repeat yourself, @oldmcstabbin (warning)
[5:47:48] Erielle04: @Vendralos that is concerning
[5:47:49] MereMortal: @oldmcstabbin But they aren't...
[5:47:51] Sollice: @oldmcstabbin No I didn't miss the memo. I said what to the "death throws" comment
[5:47:56] Hizuru1: Watch it being time gated and it gets playable after they remove caps.
[5:47:57] Hebrewish012: i like it making it one central currency
[5:48:16] oldmcstabbin: @MereMortal they are...
[5:48:22] largefromage: no gear run
[5:48:23] Arbszy: The Electric Pyramids
[5:48:24] its____rooster: do it on a low level toon
[5:48:25] PvtHudson093: VP could be this seasons SBG
[5:48:27] Tac2cul: knockbacks off the platforms
[5:48:30] Masqerader: all those solo player whiners will finally shut up now about upgrading their world quest gear
[5:48:32] Sollice: They aren't merging factions. They are allowing cross faction guilds
[5:48:38] Kisswani: there were annoying lightning pyramids where you couldn't CC stuff right ?
[5:48:43] Foretoldlegends: "I don't remember this. But I think it's also going to kill you."
[5:48:43] Effin_Steffin: Bye Tauren Paladin
[5:48:45] MereMortal: @oldmcstabbin guild membership isn't combining the factions
[5:48:54] Masqerader: last boss u need to hid in the lines
[5:48:57] reggiepowa: cata timewalking is on 28th so check it out then for better idea
[5:48:57] Masqerader: or w/e
[5:49:07] Mecabeast: Kill the orbs to cross the platform will suck for all melee group
[5:49:17] Epiclurker27893: Drake of the North wind farm part 2
[5:49:25] Kisswani: and the last boss where people get nuked for not going in the circle or somehting
[5:49:29] trolltrucked: Saw an article today they are taking away the 4th affix in m+ next season and looking at changing all dungeons so there won’t be kick rotations on adds. Next season will be the easiest season in history of m+
[5:49:32] oldmcstabbin: @Sollice yeah because thats the hand-holding we need with a game with "WAR" in the title...
[5:49:39] Masqerader: remember when exorsus all went dwarf for nathria and blizzard was like nah dawg and made it not work with the bleed
[5:49:39] its____rooster: what are the chances of a faction change sale when cross guilds come out?
[5:49:40] flebbooo: MDI do love their Stoneform
[5:49:46] Tac2cul: jump for static cling
[5:50:00] Sollice: @oldmcstabbin You only have to WAR with the horde? We dont war with everything else. Weird hill to die on
[5:50:13] Hizuru1: Barely cant get easier than this season
[5:50:13] Vendralos: It's on WoWHead
[5:50:14] EdgeOfTwilight: Wish we would have gottwn Waycrest manner rather then under rot
[5:50:18] Moobot: Ask a moderator for permission before posting a link, @CousinAvi86 (warning)
[5:50:25] Sollice: @EdgeOfTwilight Would have loved Waycrest
[5:50:26] abracka_: did anyone ask if we're getting a dragon riding skin for KSM in S2?
[5:50:29] Vendralos: Yes
[5:50:37] Masqerader: u mean what we been talking about for the last hr
[5:50:39] Foretoldlegends: @trolltrucked You do realize that might make more spells UNKICKABLE and make the season harder that way.
[5:50:40] Masqerader: lol
[5:50:40] CousinAvi86: ya they're removing thundering entirely, no replacement
[5:50:40] haveachub: there will still be kicks needed in dungeons lol

[5:51:18] Kisswani: P.R.E.P Kappa

[5:51:48] basementdwellingvirginx: @DudeInARobe YES please SV hunter is the Helen Keller of DF spec design
[5:51:51] im_capy: Are they going to remove faction change from the shop, or will that still be needed?
[5:51:59] donin: rather they remove fort/tyran and run 3 affixes
[5:52:01] saintsinnerxo: o god not this dungeon

[5:52:24] Kisswani: @im_capy good point , should be just race change now
[5:52:24] DudeInARobe: @basementdwellingvirginx for sure. it feels real good on ST lol but just cause of mongoose bite. Their AOE is just not on par with other melee specs atm
[5:52:26] im_n0t_jezus: YEP playing ranged
[5:52:28] Sollice: @oldmcstabbin You realize it's an ongoing story. They are allowed to change lol
[5:52:30] ThaOriginalGamester: Reverse training dummy
[5:52:31] dschmidt: @im_capy its still needed for the races. they are just allowing cross faction guilds

[5:54:57] cynical_effect12: Spell block OP
[5:54:58] macheek: this boss will be nightmare for healers
[5:55:02] Sollice: @oldmcstabbin I will mod you if you can prove classic has more players
[5:55:02] Hebrewish012: run out
[5:55:03] Naxonus: I love wow, I’m not saying it in a bad way, but it isn’t as popular as it used to be
[5:55:05] Hebrewish012: run back in
[5:55:07] Kisswani: the tornadoes close in
[5:55:13] derry10: i am curious if if they are going to change the fights at all for mythic
[5:55:23] DudeInARobe: This with storming, pog lol
[5:55:27] hammack52: all those nados do aoe

[5:56:12] DrakeDuude: we going to need cc in this dungeon
[5:56:17] 91Niki: Did that guy just say classic has more players than live? OMEGALUL
[5:56:17] Nokterian: More thundering in the dungeon than the entire season 1 in vortex pinnacle LUL
[5:56:25] beerking2323: the clouds of doom
[5:56:27] Sollice: @91Niki I think he was on some bad shit Niki
[5:56:29] Metket: LFG tanks couldn't get dragon out of healing zone......
[5:56:30] cynical_effect12: Shroud skip i bet
[5:56:33] Reznr: they definitely are
[5:56:34] reggiepowa: they have to add mechanics
[5:56:35] hammack52: you know they will they did in HoV
[5:56:36] DudeInARobe: for the bosses i'm sure they do. not on trash

[5:56:40] Hebrewish012: i hope they give it the TJS rework touches
[5:56:43] ytsidilas: vortex will be a nightmare
[5:56:45] Naxonus: Maybe dying was too strong, more like dwindling, dragonflight was the first expansion in a long time to not outsell the previous and get tons of praise around its sales
[5:56:52] SpyCrabbo: i guess they will things more readable, like a ground effect for the clouds
[5:56:54] dannyis1337: they changed tjs so yeah they will add shit
[5:56:56] Naxonus: Which sucks because this expansion is amazing
[5:57:00] iNeF_: i think will be the same like old dung
[5:57:05] flebbooo: probably will see a lot of reworks to bosses aswell like Wise Mari
[5:57:08] trolltrucked: Is this dungeon the same on heroic tho? I noticed the gear you got said heroic.
[5:57:11] dschmidt: @91Niki dude quadrupled down on his terrible take.
[5:57:13] YinYangMan77: I remember when Cata dungeons were "hard" and people complained about it...
[5:57:24] Kinghorn: you scouting vortex before 10.1?
[5:57:25] Plague_GG: Give us pre-nerf cata dungeons Kappa
[5:57:26] Kinghorn: LUL
[5:57:29] Snabido: Those dragons were brutal monkaS
[5:57:33] garmin1987: face down wind for haste buff
[5:57:38] garmin1987: on next boss
[5:57:40] temp3st98: the deadliest abililty the auto attack LUL
[5:57:47] mavericks312: @Naxonus true but the sub rentention is higher with DF also the same happend with legion right after how bad WoD was
[5:57:57] ProfessorChaoos: Will you be messing with d4 beta?
[5:58:04] hammack52: i bet that healing well will not work for players in the M+

[5:58:57] hammack52: this fight and the last fight are goign to kill people
[5:58:57] HoboFighter2: The dungeon isn't really open, its pretty linear, you basically pull all trash automatically
[5:59:04] Nokterian: I'm 4 days off next week for the D4 Beta
[5:59:07] mavericks312: this boss is trash for casters
[5:59:09] temp3st98: rip healers
[5:59:10] hammack52: last guy is going to be worse
[5:59:14] reggiepowa: underrot was great
[5:59:15] Hebrewish012: that boss will be bad on tyran
[5:59:17] Vendralos: Underrot is fine
[5:59:17] Artonis1: 2nd boss in underrot
[5:59:18] rivera9: cloaks and necks, omfg werer all screwed
[5:59:19] Artonis1: not a fun time
