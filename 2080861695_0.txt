[0:36:30] wobven: huge wpvp at fair
[0:36:50] avoidedneXt: pretty much
[0:36:53] wakener00: GOOD HONEY
[0:36:53] Xyrus33: if its real honey
[0:36:55] Nitewinds: basically never expires yeah
[0:36:55] existinne: ya honey is superfood. Honey never expires right
[0:36:59] techbrogamer: honey doesn’t expire lil bud
[0:37:01] GoodGuyEli74: I mean isnt their a date on it?
[0:37:02] wobven: it crystalizes
[0:37:05] rolandude: doesnt typically have a shelf life
[0:37:06] brjnoqo3kd: Because of its high sugar and low moisture content, it can last for a very long time. However, contamination, improper storage, and cheap additives may shorten its shelf life. Honey is one of the oldest sweeteners consumed by humans, with recorded use as far back as 5,500 BC. It’s also rumored to have special, long-lasting properties.
[0:37:08] brjnoqo3kd: google
[0:37:08] howudoinTV: honey should be good for a bit, double check for an expiration date @Graycen
[0:37:09] revora_: Sugar
[0:37:10] techbrogamer: even ur immune system can take it
[0:37:17] existinne: cuz it don't
[0:37:25] ErobbIsWhite: still faking your sickness? 4Weird nobody is buying it buddy
[0:37:27] Thedruidtyler: cause thats how science works
[0:37:38] Mynameskody: because its antimicrobial or whatever no?
[0:37:39] techbrogamer: damn gup sounds fucking beat bro get some sleep
[0:37:40] Gosu_Rival: Hi Graycen, Hope you feel better. Stopping in to say Hi, sleep time.
[0:37:51] Nitewinds: honey never expires because bacteria can't live in it to spoil it
[0:37:51] existinne: Even when it's all crystalized it's good
[0:38:01] sepph_: @techbrogamer he also looks beat, he looks rough
[0:38:16] Thedruidtyler: kermit: They say, “Honey stored in sealed containers can remains stable for decades and even centuries!” The reason for the magical longevity of honey lies in its biological makeup. Because of the sugar content and low pH of honey, as well as the bees' honey-making process, organisms that can spoil food won't survive in honey.
[0:38:17] brjnoqo3kd: your throat has been fucked he said?
[0:38:24] Mynameskody: its just free ammo to roast you w tbh
