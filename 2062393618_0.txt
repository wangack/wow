[3:07:51] Peoplewhinetoomuch: better than ashenvale though
[3:07:53] 94Daniiel: they should do when u alone u get more blood or something
[3:07:53] varatupaj: as a sleath class its ok to solo
[3:07:57] Semisweetzulu: u should get times X if ur less then 5. most if ur solo.
[3:08:00] nailerak: imagine forcing people to socialize in an MMO...
[3:08:05] recendas: well as a stealther u can solo
[3:08:11] shubic: I think they fucked up with the partying up
[3:08:12] recendas: but as a warrior rip
[3:08:20] Jorbadd: God rogue are going to be insanely op at 60
[3:08:32] zanics: it would be incredible if it was actually full solo
[3:08:33] FY_Django: just saw a 5 man shadow group and alt4 instantly
[3:08:36] bakerpls: playing solo should give more blood yeah. would be a solution
[3:08:37] zanics: but thats now how wow is i guess
[3:08:48] madaat: you get blood from everyone in your party if they kill someone i believe
[3:08:57] SniperNamedG: Only getting blood on killing blows is kinda annoying solo
[3:09:01] zanics: theres penalties if you make a raid group or something i think?
[3:09:02] AceOfFlame: I love soloing because when two groups fight I just open up on one of their casters quick and vanish
[3:09:07] zanics: but no penalty for 5 man
[3:09:09] SniperNamedG: everyone just yoinkin your kills lol
[3:09:17] zape007: playing mmorpg but doesn't like the mmo part
[3:09:25] shubic: they didnt think about this at all, it sucks
[3:09:28] zanics: leave anti social rogues alone
[3:09:28] ChrisarN: what is the penalty of making a raid?
[3:09:32] ama__deus: I don't mind that it encourages 5 man groups. It's fun together if it's not lagging
[3:09:45] AceOfFlame: @shubic thats entirely dishonest to say
[3:09:46] SniperNamedG: @ChrisarN -5% stats and movement speed
[3:09:48] Peoplewhinetoomuch: DansGame

[3:11:21] zanics: i hate the event except for ganking in booty bay which is ok i guess
[3:11:27] QuickfireDouble: they should split separate layers for group play and for solo play
[3:11:29] zanics: but its because i dont want to group up so my own fault
[3:11:45] cripples42069: solo players should get buffed
[3:12:03] VoodooYoshi: !talents
[3:12:03] cripples42069: and the more kills and stuff you get the stronger you get. only applies to solo players.

[3:13:27] ama__deus: Probably. They'll nerf it likely on the 20th though
[3:13:36] PoisonTech: dwarf priest can break blind twice LUL
[3:13:41] CardozaYT: how is the energy tick addon called?
[3:13:42] 1337nugget: casters in wow vanilla werent supposed to have this much spellpower at 1-40, its completely overtuned
[3:13:44] QuickfireDouble: void plague does a shitton of damage (source: i play priest)
[3:13:44] zanics: it breaks guard AI in ratchet its actually cheating
[3:13:48] Trid337: melee hunters need nerf too
[3:13:57] bomzzwtf: cant compare them
[3:14:10] ama__deus: so does arcane surge, hell raptor strike op as fuck too
[3:14:10] zanics: i think its pretty easy to just not put instant cast spells that do a billion damage into the game
[3:14:11] reiburr: will you buy the off-hand for blood coin?
[3:14:15] ama__deus: damage in general is just too high
[3:14:20] zanics: not rocket science blizzard
[3:14:21] madaat: you cant start neef now, need more gear for everyone to see how others perform
[3:14:22] bomzzwtf: priest takes 50% of the damage if it doesnt kill
[3:14:22] CardozaYT: Hey Pshero, how's the addon that shows energy ticks called?
[3:14:26] itbeHootie: everyone does too much dmg
[3:14:27] 1337nugget: @reiburr you can only wear 1 of them daggers at once
[3:14:29] rxcxx_: starsurge doesnt do damage to you when u dont kill
[3:14:35] acidagger: @CardozaYT nug energy
[3:14:38] rxcxx_: no drawbacksurge also has a 4 sercond cd SWD is much higher

[3:18:56] SniperNamedG: the blood loss just seems random. Happens in party sometimes too.
[3:18:56] 23rhz: losing blood is new
[3:19:00] d1marzio: free for all event btw
[3:19:02] 23rhz: today i lost alot in party
[3:19:02] ama__deus: It encourages parties. Why is that an issue?
[3:19:09] SniperNamedG: its been like that since first event. But I think its just buggy
[3:19:17] AceOfFlame: if you stay near the loa boss you never lose blood, its how people can get over 500+
[3:19:19] maxkorchell: with party 6-700 blood
[3:19:21] 23rhz: ya i guess so
[3:19:22] bassiemon123: Dont u Just lose blood when u instant revive
[3:19:25] PoisonTech: yes, they fixed it
[3:19:26] bomzzwtf: u lost in party from beginng its just bugged
[3:19:26] Lrlol: id rather not party and still get benefits
[3:19:31] Spliffaroony: yeah i think it would be a lot more fun if you couldn't join groups
[3:19:31] PoisonTech: more blood loss now YEP
[3:19:33] SniperNamedG: You are probably suppose to always lose blood, but you just dont for some reason.
[3:19:39] morphyck: For some reason, usually only 1 person the party loses blood. That's what I noticed
[3:19:42] zanics: ama__deus because people enjoy games in different ways and shouldnt feel forced into things they dont want to do when there isnt a good reason for it

[8:41:42] MakavelicGG: @Swdswpvtmcmd logic
[8:41:51] erlend94: @FatherOwens Since that throwing rune is so bad damage and threat. its basically just building threat on one, taunting another, then building on 3rd. it was kind of painful, slightly better withblade flurry.
[8:41:56] joeylouis: you dont need to keep loggign in and out, just watchthe realms screen they will enable automatically

[12:24:12] TheDastardlyD: standing in the frost on the group looked like
[12:24:18] LueDawg: you can dispel yes
[12:24:22] TheDastardlyD: ground*
[12:24:25] infernous22: you can dispel not to get to 10 stacks
[12:24:36] paganlzer: the kill on the first clear took us 13 min xD
[12:24:39] gdkpgold: @peeweeherman69 no it just stuns u
[12:24:49] infernous22: there is no time to dispel if u get iceblocked

[12:27:24] saosin0: melee will be top dps you have less to do :)
[12:27:26] paganlzer: need meta lock with SP for the bombs xd
[12:27:30] Lord_boudah: @dimichsky thats neat then
[12:27:38] Gutstv213: 300 is usually top parse i think
[12:27:38] peeweeherman69: i do more dps than those 2 hunters combined as melee hunt LUL

[12:40:01] Lucons1: !why
[12:40:08] gdkpgold: @Knaxxis yeah he should focus the bombs instead of tunneling the boss
[12:40:23] bassiemon123: Answer: its a ps/ziqo raid

[12:42:10] peeweeherman69: wipe counter?
[12:42:37] thewolfmans: Freezing: A stacking debuff that slows affected raid members, applied from Supercooled Smash as well as the frost patches left on the ground from Bombs killed during Phase 2.
[12:42:38] TheDastardlyD: I think he's a boomkin he should be able to ic kill a bomb
[12:42:41] saosin0: someone had buttons two times perhaps
[12:42:51] zickiwow: why is this man yelling
[12:43:07] xBONGLORDx: bombs
[12:43:12] Timiurgo: I do
[12:43:16] gdkpgold: ziqo spawns the fire
[12:43:19] saosin0: every range should click at the button xD
[12:43:21] Fluffshock: Didi anyone else just get 2 minutes of straight honda ads???
[12:43:22] peeweeherman69: 2nd tank needs to taunt if he has 2 much stacks, you get stacks if you sit infront of him or hit from flamethrower/bombs
[12:43:24] ng_requiem: bombs exploding cause the fire on groujd
[12:44:25] ng_requiem: Druid can shape shift the frost debuff - others can fap the debuff (best to do it on 2 stacks and pop fap at 10sec left on debuff (for frost phase) so you are immune for 3rd wave + it will be back up for final phase) - if tank has the boot enchant for speed, he can outrun the fire and lose all stacks during the flamethrower

[12:50:16] bassiemon123: Its long af tho
[12:50:31] daLuhz: @PsheroTV clicking the button with 2 poison stacks will nearly 1 shot you
[12:50:34] daLuhz: hits for nearly 2k
[12:51:05] thewolfmans: @PsheroTV In the 4th and final phase of the encounter, Thermaplugg uses a combination of abilities from the first three phases.
[12:51:29] daLuhz: he clicked the button with poison stacks

[12:51:36] peeweeherman69: watching that druid is monkatos
[12:51:41] Goswin1: ppl walk under the bombs to press the button, you have to come from the right side always
[12:51:45] zickiwow: KEKW

[12:53:36] peeweeherman69: the useless 20 parse warrior leaves this why these players never get into a decent raid
[12:53:38] xBONGLORDx: and use the buttons more with nature pot
[12:53:43] gdkpgold: you dont need healing if you kill the boss faster with homunculi

[12:56:23] indratus: This boss has less mechanics than random LFR retail raid boss. Classic andies strugglin around is amusing to watch LUL
[12:56:31] almedin4444: u can drag him on 5% all way to the gate so the transition before phases will last longer u can replenish a lot of mana hp in meantime
[12:57:05] Tattisotilass: monkaSTEER gnomer music bis
[12:57:10] dovahtv_: @indratus its also a 10man raid an not 20 or 40 lmao
