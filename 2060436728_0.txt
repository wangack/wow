[0:33:26] Semis394: i think even SAM is a good rogue? do you agree?
[0:33:26] totopunchertv: @2pikula hes playing lock
[0:33:28] chrisiirc: his brain is wired perfectly for wow
[0:33:32] NPBeharry: yeah let’s not get confused trill is an absolutely top level rogue
[0:33:34] Zaiyge: Europe was all about counter picking NA was just pick ur main comp and play it through
[0:33:41] 2pikula: @totopunchertv yeahh but he's not a real lock main ya know?
[0:33:56] KevnPaik: bring back double rogue with sam
[0:33:57] mengths: i think pika/whaaz are better stand alone rogues, but trill is just as good if not better as a 3s rogue if that makes sense
[0:33:59] drummond777: trill is such a good asset to the team
[0:34:03] murasuo: Cdew u did to damn good today
[0:34:06] totopunchertv: is there a reason why sam not playing mage or is just comp driven @cdewx
[0:34:08] PittleLuss: doesnt it just help that trill is an insane player at the game in general not just rogue
[0:34:24] umo3: he did say that I was in his stream lmao

[0:35:38] Zaiyge: I swear Mehh has like a 70% death and fade chance on every cc when he has it up
[0:35:41] Owlcopwn: so wait, does this mean you're the back to back to back to back awc champs now?
[0:35:52] Semis394: poor Lontar is getting all the hate. nobody cant gill mehx shoes
[0:35:56] terranapart: It's just drama
[0:35:58] Semis394: fill*
[0:35:59] ATHLTE: diff meta too
[0:36:00] lazyturtle0824: Agreed
[0:36:07] NPBeharry: let’s just say trill is so good at rogue at this point it’s hard to imagine him playing anything else
[0:36:13] ATHLTE: and alot more competitive rn
[0:36:15] beeftip: @Knozyr Queue into him and beat him.
[0:36:19] GnarstyTV: Lontar just ate a burger before games, give him a break.
[0:36:23] Owlcopwn: if you face mehh, are you two going to gentleman agreement to play pres?
[0:36:27] datmark: what do you think about the super bowl champs?
[0:36:28] ripinpeace10: @cdewx disc priest not good enough right now you think? dont notice them in awc
[0:36:39] KevnPaik: lontar also had to take a year off competitive wow
[0:36:42] Anonymityy: Sam is the only mage main i know who gave up mage and is just as good at other classes.  Mages dont multi class well
[0:36:45] Knozyr: It’s an opinion of course
[0:36:50] axariel98: Is Paladin Holy the weakest healer this season?
[0:36:51] Vadoloco: Hey brother - good job today! havent followed pvp scene for a good minute. Whats the state of NA vs EU - is the EU teams good? whats the main ones over there @cdewx
[0:36:58] NPBeharry: I mean I think mehh is better than Lontar but that doesn’t mean he isn’t insane, he’s obviously top tier, kubzy was better at flop at rdruid but that didn’t mean flop was insane
[0:36:58] Moobot: Follow me! https://twitter.com/cdew_wow https://www.youtube.com/tenderloinx1
[0:37:01] EFFSIN: well thats cause2 brains is better then one

[0:37:06] chachio_dk: grats this weekend well earned
[0:37:06] ATHLTE: 100%
[0:37:10] tatanami1: Lontar is first guy on the ladder idk why ppl hate him
[0:37:14] 2pikula: if you guys had a rematch in the finals with the move again today - how do you feel that match up would've gone? @cdewx
[0:37:16] Owlcopwn: BabyRage
[0:37:16] NPBeharry: wasn’t*
[0:37:18] juicymeld: seems like everyday you’re having to explain this to people. what’s with the constant “oh he’s better, no he’s better” does it not get old ?
[0:37:19] drummond777: wait.... people think raiku/whaazz are bad? lmfao
[0:37:24] ripinpeace10: @cdewx  disc priest not good enough right now you think? dont notice them in awc
[0:37:30] Owlcopwn: @drummond777 no, they are saying they are good
[0:37:39] Vigi9413: can't imagine you/mes/trill/sam not playing together
[0:37:43] murasuo: u exited to see echo vs the move march 1st?
[0:37:45] GLYFEnation: Are you going to Disneyland now?
[0:38:02] EFFSIN: Thank god kubzy took out the FW comp amirite @cdewx
[0:38:03] ripinpeace10: is disc healing just really weak? the toolkit is so fun on ladder and i have success against a lot of things except rdruid
[0:38:07] tatanami1: If there is priest meta meh would be better but in this meta lontar is way better then him
[0:38:08] murasuo: yea
[0:38:14] pharmztko: gauntlet is March 1
[0:38:15] mayfire15: 1st is gauntlet
[0:38:15] Darkpain876: U shaved the whole beard noooo
[0:38:17] Noscoc: have we seen hpal? seems decent enough
[0:38:22] Hazythe4Saken: Hey man, not seeing RMD, RMP all over the place is a breath of fresh air!
[0:38:23] NPBeharry: I think you would be a good healer on echo but it’s hard to imagine you playing without liquid now
[0:38:24] axariel98: Is Paladin Holy the weakest healer this season?
[0:38:37] mayfire15: would you rogue boomkin into it?
[0:38:39] mitchell_xd: were you surprised by the destro dh
[0:38:45] Vigi9413: you guys played REALLY well in the grand final
[0:38:47] pharmztko: ya
[0:38:50] dailyshuffle: yoo cdew, finally a new and finished haircut LUL
[0:38:52] mayfire15: yes
[0:38:53] Darkpain876: Bro cdew you are a god man idk how you kept sam in one of the matches you're the GOAT
[0:38:54] murasuo: the tournament will be the na vs eu?
[0:39:04] 2pikula: what team is the scariest to play against this season?
[0:39:13] Darkpain876: @dailyshuffle Looking like a punk band leader LUL
[0:39:23] mayfire15: did dh destro win eu?
[0:39:30] neziiiii: supa said they had the dmg for sure but their defense was lacking
[0:39:33] dailyshuffle: @dailyshuffle LUL
[0:39:35] Vigi9413: the 2v2 earlier in the weekend was the highlight of the tourney
[0:39:43] iggy_pls: did they tell you something about you calling the move golden guardians? im curious
[0:39:52] Eastr0n: What u think happened with the move? Did you watch their games?
[0:39:55] ripinpeace10: @cdewx  is disc healing just really weak? the toolkit is so fun on ladder and i have success against a lot of things except rdruid
[0:40:08] Jubite: @iggy_pls golden guardians the esports org isnt a thing anymore, they went under when riot removed LCS spots
[0:40:08] cutexlol_: i just realized i missed the Superbowl lmao
[0:40:12] mayfire15: idk eu dh’s must be on another lvl
[0:40:12] NPBeharry: tbh I think Lontar is just getting started a lot of people will be eating their words in the next two cups
[0:40:13] 2pikula: it's really entertaining to watch you guys vs the move. by far my favorite matchup
[0:40:17] perfectyqt: !awc
[0:40:20] shredder1111: whazz was saying u shouldnt have won because trill wasnt disarm/cloak pvp talent
[0:40:26] iggy_pls: @Jubite yes I know but cdew called the team golden guardians during the interview
[0:40:31] NAT0_141: was a sick totem placed on that mage eariler too negating his reposition
[0:40:35] perfectyqt: awc!
[0:40:40] juicymeld: @2pikula 2 best na teams ofc
[0:40:42] ripinpeace10: @cdewx pom seems so trash as disc i feel like its not worth playing
[0:40:54] NPBeharry: he was thrown into an undefeated team I think he performed as good as any of the top healers would have
[0:40:54] Ulby42: what’re your thoughts on these high vers warrior comps?
[0:41:00] Drathimos: what about pres hots
[0:41:14] Vigi9413: missed the final today but saw you guys 4-0 big grats
[0:41:23] 2pikula: @juicymeld definitely. but it's also just the best matchup in terms of comps
[0:41:33] ripinpeace10: @cdewx if they buff pom to what holys is for disc would that make a difference?
[0:41:41] NPBeharry: would you have stayed on rsham into le pomp? I was curious about that if they beat power frogs
[0:41:45] DrJonExotic: !factor

[0:41:52] mitchell_xd: what’s up with the spirit links dying before working on tourney realms? never seen it happen so often on live
[0:42:01] ripinpeace10: i love my disc tho :(

[0:42:33] EFFSIN: lol
[0:42:36] murasuo: Was Luminosity rlly scary to play into when they were dominating?
[0:42:38] jrapp106: @cdewx why do you think kubzy's team went with destro/dh into the move when they beat them with RMD yesterday?
[0:42:40] KevnPaik: why u gotta call out mvq like that
[0:42:45] NPBeharry: the good dhs in na don’t play in tourney
[0:42:52] Vigi9413: lava lava and pirate petes just swapping one shots was fun lol
[0:42:56] EFFSIN: Sam best DH na
[0:43:05] NPBeharry: trill? @effsin
[0:43:12] bear9821: Do you think coffey is the best overall dh?
[0:43:16] NPBeharry: trill won blizzcon as dh not Sam
[0:43:33] scarr16: have u guys tried to run-back the blizzcon DH/boomy comp?
[0:43:47] Legoess: Gods walking amonst men xD
[0:43:55] Ripen94: Ripen94 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[0:43:58] boocraft1992: EU even outside of games claim to be superior lol. It's just an EU thing to claim to be the best
[0:44:06] murasuo: trill is an insane dh, does sam play lock?
[0:44:12] EFFSIN: I heard EU gets worse ping then NA
[0:44:19] chrisiirc: nahj said when he was playing at 2400 on his eu char that they felt like 1600 NA KEKW
[0:44:25] NPBeharry: raiku actually looked stronger than I thought he would Chanimal was clowning on his dh but he looked pretty solid
[0:44:43] FreddyFerrera: is damage reduction % multiplicative or additive? Like pain suppression + earth shield = 46% damage reduction? @cdewx
[0:44:48] Aimed57: its going to be just as interesting for the EU teams, most of them haven't fought the clone city PogChamp
[0:44:59] tatanami1: I played from houston when i worked on ship with 180ms on eu servers
[0:45:00] shopkeeperyt: it should be lan tournies again
[0:45:05] NPBeharry: Sam only really plays boomie atm he had some alts but doesn’t really play them @murasuo
[0:45:10] ATHLTE: ya sams fake casting today was nutty lol
[0:45:16] NPBeharry: I think Sam could play any caster tho
[0:45:21] EFFSIN: but ur whole team is East coast no|?
[0:45:25] Owlcopwn: I'd rather not see NA vs eu unless it's LAN tbh
[0:45:29] Zaiyge: Europe looked like it was just counter comp after counter comp and they have the meta figured out but NA was just pick ur main comp and stick with it
[0:45:34] Owlcopwn: too much room for excuses
[0:45:38] Vigi9413: mes is colorado yeah?
[0:45:39] KevnPaik: sam can play any class any spec he the goat
[0:45:42] shredder1111: makes no sense to me to have so much money on the line but no lan
[0:45:52] Vigi9413: wish dk was better to see more mes
[0:45:57] gsr_: how much ping do you have is it more then 170
[0:46:01] NPBeharry: I would prefer lan but im hyped to see na vs eu again
[0:46:13] ATHLTE: hahahaha
[0:46:14] jrapp106: @cdewx why do you think kubzy's team went with destro/dh into the move when they beat them with RMD yesterday?
[0:46:18] ponchuus: Gratz on the win!!
[0:46:18] iggy_pls: so are you gonna practice on EU ping?
[0:46:25] feerce24: i mean chan was winning everything na from australia
[0:46:37] magnaeus: 250ms is only 1/4 second..sounds short time amount
[0:46:42] NPBeharry: I wanted to see the move play sub rps more
[0:46:46] lawgivver7: didn’t Prev have high MS?
[0:46:47] luckydyldo: 3-1 i believe

[0:52:38] Solushun: ret/dh :O
[0:52:41] bear9821: Mes ret and trill dh would go crazy
[0:52:44] ripinpeace10: you think hpal is what melee cleave needs in order to do good?
[0:52:48] brewtank: @cdewx when we q cleave its so brutal compared to playing with a rog lol

[3:54:22] Babyclaws: its bc of stat scaling, DK is insane every 1st pve season too bc they scale really well with little to no stats, then by season 2 all the other classes are caught up
