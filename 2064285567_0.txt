[0:17:14] bearfukuu: @FinkleTheMage I mean WSG rep will be a loss at level 60 when we get items better than those rewards
[0:17:22] OlympicUSA: Ill send screenshots
[0:17:35] OlympicUSA: Ive done over 1000 SM runs its exhausting
[0:17:40] FinkleTheMage: @bearfukuu But the bracers soooo good right now haha
[0:18:49] indocl0ud: dark rider trinket will surely come in handy Kappa
[0:19:08] linkitcraig: what are you farming STV event for?
[0:19:30] fr03doc: is that firepower elixir for raid? I don’t think that stacks with the sigils btw
[0:19:34] linkitcraig: im sure they will
[0:19:48] linkitcraig: i think it was broken
[0:20:09] linkitcraig: POOGERS classic dev
[0:20:17] FMJuca: anita max wynn
[0:20:33] indocl0ud: as a hunter i disagree
[0:20:33] FinkleTheMage: Yeah Melee Hunters and Spriests are kinda wild too
[0:20:50] lickmypetals: melee hunters - mage living flame - SWD - rogues - warlocs - all classes are out of wack besides boomy
[0:20:54] Draxamius: do you run trinket or ring from STV for raid?
[0:21:03] NutterCircus: They destroy warriors, its wild.
[0:21:45] msnedker: 5
[0:21:48] msnedker: or
[0:21:54] linkitcraig: it says unique (5)
[0:22:06] msnedker: ohh might be right
[0:22:13] bazzzgg: but doesnt that mean its not unique
[0:22:26] Doncanage: What is the best talents for pvp warlock?
[0:22:45] fr03doc: it doesn’t stack with pot buffs, so only a 6 sp increase above pots
[0:24:12] linkitcraig: last through death?
[0:24:37] linkitcraig: if u can test it before it runs out
[0:24:54] Vaceusse: XP Boosting? Viewers doesn't give you gold for free????
[0:25:09] fr03doc: yeh it doesn’t stack with elixir of firepower, sardaco tried it the other day, so quite expensive for only a bit extra
[0:25:12] FinkleTheMage: where'd you learn this magical innovation?
[0:25:20] linkitcraig: @fr03doc what about shadow power?
[0:25:21] prepsi: dos warlock get fel gard in sod ?
[0:25:30] FinkleTheMage: Gotcha, very cool :)
[0:25:43] FinkleTheMage: Do you have to have done the quest in there?
[0:26:03] linkitcraig: that was the advantage of being enchanting
[0:26:48] fr03doc: @linkitcraig that I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ stay will have to find out
[0:26:54] FinkleTheMage: Yeah 3 gold for 30 mins 20 sp, or silvers for an arcane power elixir :(
[0:27:12] FinkleTheMage: We need some ring enchants ;)
[0:27:16] linkitcraig: elixir of shadow power is 40 sp
[0:27:42] fr03doc: I’m not sure, all i know is sardaco respec to enchanting and levelled it before raid only find out it didn’t stack kekw
[0:27:49] KIPPZO: tab over the zepplin is there

[1:25:12] fischerlol: hope 40 man raids are in teh bin

[1:25:23] Kebabra_: 60 is BASED cap
[1:25:25] klucky1: that would be cool
[1:25:26] keelew: thats so much work. like a new expansion
[1:25:28] youni22: does the level cap really mean anything though
[1:25:28] klucky1: gear progression

[1:26:26] infom0rph: meta should have a glide ability though
[1:26:33] SLlCY: maybe some kind of weird arena you fight eachother on and get some type or title or reward

[1:43:07] Subjectz: communism is like the ouroboros
[1:43:12] NizPlays: @fuguelah cultural marxism is a thing that is more alive in conspiracists heads than anywhere else, let me go look for my tinfoil hat before we start this debate
[1:43:15] Draxamius: give me that capitalism with socialist tendencies like healthcare and education
[1:43:21] infom0rph: imagine living in an age of exponential human progress thanks to capitalism and being a communist, peak wetardation
[1:43:21] martelko: Idea is not bad, but it cannot be applied by humans
[1:43:33] Sasza_Cwierclitrow: communism is system trying to solve problems created by itself
[1:43:34] SavageLoaf: Communism never existed, and never have existed - the "Socialists-Soviets" stole their idea from the Ancient Greek Philosphy.. - Platos theory of Communism and some other term i forgot the name of
[1:43:41] PhokingTV_: We just need a nuclear fall out,
[1:43:41] 4ddic7: At least fascists are honest. Communist leader pretend they care about people
[1:43:43] nikolaishow: Yeah, the whole ideology of the Soviet Union was to build communism, hence, it was not a truly communist country, just a socialist country on the way to communism
[1:43:44] Peoplewhinetoomuch: @NocivoLive I don't think you can force people to stop littering, It's just a cultural thing.

[1:44:34] SleepyB0x: Modern commies also entirely ignoree that Marx HATED women
[1:44:45] deathnntaxes: true communism isnt possible, people would have to rid emotion and become robots and all want the same thing, literally will never happen ever
[1:44:47] heyitsdom_: nice
[1:44:49] NocivoLive: the issue the communism is that you need to give all resources and power to decide to a small elite that will pick everything for the rest. that is super inefficient and will eventually corrupt the people in power. thats human nature. also to achieve you need to take out people freedom.
[1:44:51] EmanuShow: Socialism is just light weight communism imho
[1:45:07] 4ddic7: @deathnntaxes @nizplays china is fascist, which equals communism
[1:45:10] chasingshadowsz: yup dicks
[1:45:11] keelew: Communish never existed. while it exists today. it's in the name: Chinese Communist Party
[1:45:17] infom0rph: communism is at odds with human nature, from it's core theory it cannot work
[1:45:18] Jesus0094: the god emperor will do fascism right
[1:45:23] nekodaye: cant argue with a commie he fell for the jew trap
[1:45:25] Paddy_Cooper: That argument can be said about literally anything, it never works
[1:45:26] Draxamius: that isn’t real zoroastrianism dude
[1:45:29] SavageLoaf: yes that is true - because as long as "communism has not existed" the "communists" will try again  PogChamp   I agree - i am against communism and i am not intrested in trying ot as "communism"
[1:45:29] englishurza: Socialism is not so bad tho. Like medicine has proven to be well run by the gov. in many countires.
[1:45:30] zoltar02b: the "ideal communism" in theory, would be good, but that will never work, I think people need to accept that
[1:45:45] ralph__laurent: China is market communism lol not real communism
[1:45:47] slantsix: if it was successful we wouldnt be having this convo
[1:46:10] NizPlays: socialism comes in certain flavours as well, the one that we have in EU (for example Belgium), is actually pretty nice. Lots of advantages for everyone as result of the socialist party
[1:46:13] EmanuShow: In any form of socialism individual freedom is always sacrificed
[1:46:21] infom0rph: the real world impact of capitalism is exponential human prosperity  :)
[1:46:22] NocivoLive: @EmanuShow socialism is nice until the worker has to put their own money on the "factory" to fix something or having to hire more people and share everything with them. xF
[1:46:26] jay_deetv: by that reasoning a benevolent dictatorship is the best form of government LUL

[1:46:38] drakkir: communism isn't for humans
[1:46:42] fuguelah: @fuguelah Delusional, cultural marxism is the status quo. Do you think the Progressive stack is a conspiracy theory? What about relativism?
[1:46:53] EmanuShow: Socialism is fine till some plebs take away your rights
[1:46:54] zoltar02b: just curious, have you ever read anything from Karl Marx? @StaysafeTV
[1:46:55] NizPlays: @NocivoLive do you really think it works that way in a modern country where socialism exists?
[1:46:59] SleepyB0x: If it didn't go entirely against human nature, it might work. But it does, so it won't.
[1:47:13] 4ddic7: sstvKING
[1:47:17] Draxamius: he’s a swiftie communist lover guys
[1:47:17] VodkaReloaded: VodkaReloaded subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Freedom baby
[1:47:22] deathnntaxes: the only way communism can work is if humans mental state turned into ants
[1:47:30] NocivoLive: @Peoplewhinetoomuch correct. that what we as society need to do. Teach our children to not do it so we fix it eventually. also stop import people that do not care about litering.
[1:47:38] doctor4ir: communists = vodka and alcohol.
[1:47:40] S_Aljallaf: What is the argument is terminally online retards use in favor of communism?? @StaysafeTV
[1:47:44] andyjamesgames: I’ve read “The American Marxist” by Mark Levine
[1:47:50] LoRswat: "ideal communism" is the same as a "actual communism" all have the same basis....and it breeds the same outcome.  Basis ~ 1 viewpoint and 1 viewpoint only.  Outcome ~ Remove opposing thought and viewpoint at all costs.
[1:47:52] PhokingTV_: I love democracy, especially when even the dead get a vote now that's a huge W
[1:48:05] chasingshadowsz: very not guud...yerp
[1:48:12] SavageLoaf: I have not read the Communist Manifesto - but i did read Alexander Solzhenitsyns; Gulag Archipelago (which is why i see Communists as my mortal enemy)
[1:48:14] englishurza: You hate marx what he ever do to you? He dead bro.
[1:48:19] NocivoLive: @NizPlays there is no country with socialism.
[1:48:21] Lilavieve: the manifesto, imo, should be viewed mainly within a historical context, and doesn't translate well to the world today
[1:48:31] shaggy462: and yet theres so many people supporting "communism" on the internet today, imagine if this was the 1950's/1960's again
[1:48:51] jay_deetv: Marx was a whacko virgin
[1:49:15] freehawk1: Breaking: Navalny, Russian Activist and Putin critic, died in prison!!!
[1:49:15] fuguelah: when really the solution is socialism that is nationlistic?
[1:49:16] NizPlays: @NocivoLive let me rephrase my question: do you really think it would work that way if socialists in a modern democracy would earn over 50% of the votes?
[1:49:26] malingonium: I think there might be some application with communism in a post scarcity/post human society, but otherwise I don't see it cutting it
[1:49:38] Nero_RME: All the evidence speaks to gross failings
[1:49:42] Geriden01: Boosting alt and gold farming at the same time
[1:49:53] doctor4ir: china is doing great tho
[1:49:58] Draxamius: biggest issue with communism is that it eliminates the “carrot on a stick” of “making it” that america relies on
[1:50:06] Draxamius: so many people working 9-5 for the american dream
[1:50:27] Aeycka__: @doctor4ir you really think the average Joe in China is happy? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[1:50:31] jay_deetv: @doctor4ir the CCP is doing great. lots of Chinese citizens live horrible poverty stricken lives

[1:50:46] doctor4ir: @Aeycka__ no i don't. but as a whole the system works
[1:50:54] SavageLoaf: The Gulag Archipelago is like a written video of second hand evidence of the real world of..  But Karl Marx and the Manifesto is more like ready a unupdated version of a very today modern progress system - it means you are going backwards i would guess..
[1:51:01] shaggy462: @Aeycka__ i'd be miserable as fuck stuck in 1 of them mega apartment buildings

[1:51:37] jay_deetv: the poor in the US have it better than the poor just about anywhere elae
[1:51:38] SavageLoaf: In the Soviet life they made simple laws just to imprison and murder people - which is still going on in R.F. today
[1:51:49] Aeycka__: wouldn't a pretty good definiton of "as a whole the system works" be that the average citizen is happy?
[1:51:51] aleck1776: YEP
[1:51:53] jay_deetv: elementary level thinking the poor in one country = poor in another
[1:51:54] NocivoLive: @NizPlays no because they would never be able to implement it without removing the rights of the other 50%.
[1:51:58] shaggy462: yes
[1:52:04] freehawk1: Hindsight is 20/20
[1:52:13] shaggy462: outsourcing everything to china was a mistake
[1:52:25] Aeycka__: @doctor4ir hmm, I wouldn't bet money on the average american being more miserable than the average chinese person, but you've got a point there I admit
[1:52:29] SavageLoaf: India is taking over Iphone production
[1:52:40] NocivoLive: I agree. specially because is a party dictatorship. we need to stop sending money though aid or buying their stuff unless they share a common ideal or culture.
[1:53:06] doctor4ir: @Aeycka__ <3
[1:53:06] LoRswat: for having an independent thought in China, you're sent for reeducation in their western provinces..... mental and physical torture....yes, that's a GREAT Time for the average Chinese Citizen  FailFish
[1:53:39] jay_deetv: @lorswat its insane the comparison to the poor in the US vs the poor in China

[1:53:54] aleck1776: They dont think the same way as us
[1:53:59] SavageLoaf: For the last 20 years our Western Nations have had donation packages on billions of money in different currencies to foreign nations who dont share the same Civic & Cultural value and which have corrupt governments- sadly now because people notice they treat Ukraine donations (which is more similar to us and actualy on point in with our history)

[2:07:26] SoWereInCopperThen: Same could go for its lunch time in the eu ...... british are on their tea time in chat
[2:07:29] oversir: The main reason Russia invaded Ukraine - it is a classic Empire - they wanted to preserve a monopoly in Europe on grain, food, oil and gas. There were found enormous oil and gas volumes under the 2 regions russia seized in 2014. The amount was so big it could deny around half of the EU gas market from them. Also, russia needs its port cities in Black Sea, because its ports in the northern part of EU are limited in throughput
[2:07:31] Subjectz: Presumptuous to think people for Florida sleep.

[2:08:09] zoltar02b: plus putin is too old for that i think now
[2:08:11] Azenics: I think Russia just wants Ukraine (atleast most of it) and Baltics
[2:08:12] Pwinzor: the most obvious reason is russia wants trade routes via the black sea to the middle east for oil trade
[2:08:17] jonisyntinen: NO, thats western propaganda its finest
[2:08:21] SoWereInCopperThen: russia wont win against germany.  they almost lost to them in ww2 and germany was fighting 2 sides

[2:08:38] EmanuShow: Nah russia not interested in world domination, their interrest is russian etnicity
[2:08:43] shaggy462: @doctor4ir I think russia are afraid of falling out of the "top dogs" of the world stage, i think its a sense of pride with them too tbh
[2:08:45] PhokingTV_: Why does Russia never fuck w Finland
[2:08:53] ufox1: It's expensive to keep an empire
[2:08:53] PhokingTV_: Is Finland some secret bad ass country
[2:08:55] medistamoose: Well, historically speaking, tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been rooted in various geopolitical, historical, and cultural factors. One significant event was Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, following Ukraine's political shift towards the West.
[2:08:59] NocivoLive: @Stylazaor yes if others don't pay their share. But finally they open their eyes and are starting to pay more
[2:08:59] Aeycka__: @PhokingTV_ they've tried a couple of times
[2:08:59] nonewstv: I am from Russia - i want freedom of speach :(

[2:09:27] doctor4ir: @shaggy462 same goes with USA. and china. As a non american. If i'm american I would want to be #1 always too
[2:09:29] Sprattelskum: Simo Häyhä isnt it?
[2:09:32] AmarokUnchained: GM BASEDCIGAR
[2:09:33] SavageLoaf: The most core part of Russia was that they were receiveing the same similar lend-lease as Ukraine is receiving from Europe and US today
[2:09:33] mikkolock: Simo häyhä
[2:09:34] NizPlays: their motive is just NATO's expansion over the past decades, Ukraine did provoke quite a few times over the past years/decades (which doesn't warrant them to invade a sovereign country btw)
[2:09:35] rollo4yolo: You had 1 sniper with more than 300 confirmed kills. and he was using a SHITTY ASS RIFLE
[2:09:38] Sprattelskum: The White Death ;D

[2:09:52] AmarokUnchained: what a great name
[2:09:53] shaggy462: @doctor4ir Yeah you're right, i'm not american either so i see it
[2:09:54] rollo4yolo: His Rifle was super shitty. and he did that UNREAL!
[2:09:55] Draxamius: you need to google Salma Hayek now
[2:09:56] oversir: If Ukraine falls it will happen in 5 to 10 years. You can see how NATO weak by their reactions on their borders. Russia already used migration crisis as a weapon on the Poland borders. They just transport any willing migrants through Russia and Belarus next to the border.
[2:10:05] Sicapelle: Larry Thorne was also a pretty based finn

[2:10:57] mikkolock: He got hit I'm the head and still survived
[2:10:58] GeorgiTtv: melee hunter
[2:11:00] toettiz: He didn't even use a scope on his rifle

[2:14:57] NocivoLive: @shaggy462 no sure. today many countries can survive and be fine without resources. you just need to trade with friends. Look Japan.
[2:15:07] chamlet2764: just use Google maps satellite view ez

[4:06:04] CringeK: @WhiteTowerGaming BASEDHALT
[4:06:07] LogiTheBear: This is the third day of maintenance in a row for us right?
[4:06:08] the_do0d: @MadJacker15 this is a no porn zone you can beat off all you want
[4:06:10] Papagibss: @Rmont Your right. But theres no other way to tell the amount of people immgrating to our country illegal or illegal
[4:06:19] SleepyB0x: @StaysafeTV You gonna play Hardcore Self Found when it releases?
[4:06:20] Rmont: @Papagibss border patrol keeps data on encounters, etc.
[4:06:22] sirdreadeye: nerfing Locks
[4:06:31] arsenalenjoyer: small indian company
[4:06:38] Papagibss: @Rmont Heres a better one that shows we have expelled more people now then pervious administrations
[4:06:43] uzisd4: @omarali118 lol correct
[4:06:44] the_do0d: @MadJacker15 youve got most of the idea
[4:06:45] mrmangasm: WARRIOR?

[4:06:52] Papagibss: @Rmont https://www.statista.com/statistics/329256/alien-apprehensions-registered-by-the-us-border-patrol/
[4:06:54] Mawshaw: Can't wait for him to die by "accident" at 48 again FeelsOkayMan
[4:06:55] SleepyB0x: HELL YEAH, ZONECHAD
[4:07:12] Valencia_Pete: yeah its not solo self found
[4:07:12] helmetnach0s: yea it’s just SF not SSF
[4:07:13] arsenalenjoyer: ZONE MAN BACK?
[4:07:16] tsetse2fly: well they said SF not SSF
[4:07:17] hennessy147: mailbox
[4:07:19] Rmont: @Papagibss having high explusions would just be an indicator that we are letting too many in
[4:07:30] DobsonWireless: what are the rules on dungeons? just can't do them unless you can solo them? or is that the ONLY way you can group?
[4:07:31] ahwee: it does allow for ssf though
[4:07:32] Valencia_Pete: i am excited for some zone man
[4:07:33] Papagibss: @Rmont Less encounters means border patrol wasnt doing there job then?
[4:07:40] markja629: are dungeon rules the same as normal HC?
[4:07:42] EmanuShow: @StaysafeTV cant you use your american conservative connections to begin anection of sweden into USA? :p
[4:07:44] mrmangasm: I think mage would be the easiest ssf class
[4:07:46] Sourr09: new servers?
[4:07:47] Papagibss: @Rmont expulsion happens at the border
[4:07:47] Aeycka__: @StaysafeTV OSRS kind of has that ironman thing nailed down. They have options to create 2~5 Group Ironman projects
[4:07:59] 3verythingatonce: that makes it like almost impossible to raid with no trades for potions
[4:08:04] mrmangasm: not having runes will be really odd
[4:08:20] cloudstrife543: yes
[4:08:20] arsenalenjoyer: 12
[4:08:23] sirdreadeye: i took a break
[4:08:25] rocknsake: there are but it's not many people
[4:08:25] Sourr09: there was a post, some druid got atiesh on HC
[4:08:27] Aeycka__: to a non-OSRS playing layman the group ironman thing seems to make sense, but who knows if that has its own caveats
[4:08:28] Winky: they are dropping WB every day
[4:08:29] MajesticAFx: 3 people. thats it. kekw
[4:08:30] tsetse2fly: HC Elite still going
[4:08:32] augmentedawwtist: yes
[4:08:32] Timxhorton: ironforge says about 10-40 guilds
[4:08:43] 3verythingatonce: people are actually gonna have to get fire resistance gear like og vanilla
[4:08:48] augmentedawwtist: Even over here on Skull Rick we're still raiding lol
[4:08:58] gothen123: SOD phase 2 seems like it lost hype
[4:09:14] Blackout_x9: alot of the guild die?
[4:09:23] Garzag_: how long u guys expect this phase to be
[4:09:29] Winky: yo did you get felhunter?
[4:09:31] arsenalenjoyer: they need to do OSRS ironman in classic hardcore
[4:09:34] the_do0d: @Aeycka__ some of the mini games and bosses have "safe" deaths where you dont lose status. i think all bosses can de-iron you in GIM
[4:09:34] KranskyJr: A druid got the first Atiesh in HC recently
[4:09:39] tsetse2fly: 2 MC
[4:09:40] GodKingMuninn: SoD2 falling off fast, not surprising given how much they fucked up leveling with mob density and pvp being a shit show
[4:09:42] darthterac: fandy
[4:09:45] arsenalenjoyer: thank god its over
[4:09:50] RanciusAdventures: it’s amazing how many died in AQ20.
[4:09:52] Papagibss: @Rmont Also Between 1990 and February 2020, the United States border patrol figures measured "apprehensions" and "expulsions" as separate figures. Beginning in March 2020, U.S. border patrol changed its methodology to include counts for both apprehensions and expulsions as "encounters."
[4:09:53] DrDeath30: Why did they implode
[4:10:00] Timxhorton: they did more then 2. i think they did like 6 total with multi grps
[4:10:03] cloutzor: i think hardcore is a weird thing because end game is kinda irrelevant
[4:10:09] neosenpai69: why did they implode
[4:10:10] cosmin284: fuegoHi   everyone good  afternoon happy friday fuegoL fuegoH

[4:10:46] bkc_ssb: Not many people can say they did it
[4:10:50] 3verythingatonce: @GodKingMuninn he did buy gold an they took it away from him
[4:10:59] Garzag_: i think its kinda hilarious they wasted all that time levelling to not even raid
[4:11:04] darthterac: Rav the avatar was the only thing that came out of only fangs that was entertaining
[4:11:13] SipDatLean: they were openly buying gold
[4:11:16] youni22: buying gold in classic has never happened before
[4:11:16] rocknsake: lol by alot you mean every one of them
[4:11:16] GodKingMuninn: @3verythingatonce yup, people acted surprised and i'm like he said atleast a dozen times he was going to do it
[4:11:24] SoochSandals: they deff were i knew some1 in it buying it for all the streamers lol
[4:11:26] SipDatLean: i saw someone bid like 2k gold on a blue ZG cloak
[4:11:36] SipDatLean: what happens when clueless newbs buy gold
[4:11:39] ahwee: i mean the guild leader got punished by blizz for it
[4:11:44] cosmin284: doing great and have a lot of fun great sod phase 2 stream on twich with  your lvl 40  warlock
[4:11:46] 3verythingatonce: i think a lot of it was bought then gifted to streamers
[4:11:54] CringeK: He farmed that 2k gold honestly by picking 40s herbs for weeks
[4:12:01] gothen123: Gdkp Ban will stop gold buying

[4:12:18] tsetse2fly: @StaysafeTV They perfected DM East
[4:12:20] spy_bones: @gothen123 gold buying existed long before gdkp
[4:12:30] GodKingMuninn: GDKP didn't stop they just turned into privatised carry runs and loot funnels
[4:12:41] SipDatLean: tbh onlyfangs kind of killed hardcore, getting boosted back up every time u die and buying gold to bypass playing the game
[4:12:45] gothen123: Gdkp has always been in the fame
[4:12:50] Winky: i got my first real professional massage yesterday, i felt like jello
[4:12:50] bearfukuu: @GodKingMuninn They did stop for the majority of people

[4:13:35] 3verythingatonce: it was insane emiru leveled so fast and so many times
[4:13:45] wavecadet: gm
[4:13:48] 4ddic7: HC SF on its OWN server with limited grouping to levels
[4:13:49] LogiTheBear: I would turn off streams if I saw someone getting boosted. Its really uninteresting to watch.
[4:13:53] CringeK: @whd123 if you can't find a place to buy gold then you shouldn't be playing games

[4:50:10] Capnrein: Its because no one would shake his hand
[4:50:16] DubPoizon: They will say anything to get people to support war, they know they cant keep printing money to fund it, the need to psyop the dollar holders
[4:50:18] arsenalenjoyer: Maybe the NATO countries should start paying their membership dues then? monkaHmm
[4:50:20] TrumpWallWorker: struggling with Ukraine and thinks he would take Poland KEKW
[4:50:21] Skulligan79: Did you see the Putin interview with Tucker Carlson?
[4:50:38] Gealls: We should throw titanium crowbars from space to Earth
[4:50:43] markja629: then Russia and china would control the global economy which is very bad for the U.S
[4:50:56] Jazzarus_: nice, I'll look for the vod

[4:52:33] Snackboy: attillComfy give us the take
[4:52:38] wesley_dalton: BASED
[4:52:59] fietsopa4: I think Russia wants 4 regions a land bridge with Crimea
[4:53:09] killtor: I hope thats the cause. I do not want Big Mike in office.
[4:53:12] Roaringkittylol: And Joe Biden and the DNC continue to get kickbacks
[4:53:15] bsom52: very based take

[4:55:52] Snackboy: monkaHmm
[4:55:57] woodgnomes: Dad can I have some gum :)
[4:56:05] zdogbroski: The emotionality attached to their beliefs keeps them from having dialog
[4:56:05] Snackboy: pass me the gum
[4:56:09] wookieenthal: all that energy wasted on politicians who dont even know or care who you are...youre just a number

[4:57:00] Snackboy: Santa is god.
[4:57:11] rocknsake: is it just me or does it seem like the EU communities are getting more elitist and outspoken against US communities?  especially on social media
[4:57:20] fietsopa4: Santa is jolly because he's fat
[4:57:21] woodgnomes: I subbed, where is the foot cam kami1Rageshake

[4:58:20] Snackboy: @3verythingatonce What's them food providers doing attillComfy
[4:58:21] xTrueEast: but i rarely here a story where an american goes only in eu like the average twitch chat is filled with only in america comments
[4:58:21] Travisaurusrex: probably 10%

[4:59:19] omarali118: I like Americans, they are very kind
[4:59:21] cheetobbob: brits do
[4:59:23] Garzag_: ofcourse they never had freedom KKona
[4:59:29] dreadd39: the eu mindset about owning guns is the most smooth brain shit you'll ever hear LUL
[4:59:31] Snackboy: @Snackboy Like literal shit monkaLaugh ?

[4:59:55] cdubbdub: it’s fun banter with the UK ppl but the ones who take is serious need  to relax lol
[4:59:58] Snackboy: @Snackboy Based.
[5:00:02] Doribob1: have you gotten any boe blues out of here?
[5:00:06] Metaphix: They still bring up the Bosnia thing even though they were genociding eachother and that's why NATO got involved
[5:00:26] wookieenthal: its fun for the memes but thats all it should be
[5:00:28] 3verythingatonce: @Snackboy indeed
[5:00:29] rytrick1988: As a Canadian i have a hard time understanding it too lol. That  being said, i have a tough time following Canadian ones these days tooXD
[5:00:45] dreadd39: @Metaphix used to work with this bosnian dude who fought there in the 90s or something. he was ready to square up with any serb he saw
[5:00:46] tsetse2fly: The based take is NA+EU > ASIA :)
[5:00:48] drajov: i understand why you would say that as american
[5:01:01] rytrick1988: rytrick1988 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:01:08] BoySonBerryBoy: localized communities are to be expected and are long dating. an outstretched mindset trying to force understanding between polarized groups can get.. troublesome
[5:01:14] Metaphix: @dreadd39 Yeah LUL they fucking hate eachother with a ferocity
[5:01:24] Snackboy: Yeah don't ask me about canadian politics either. its a clown show for all i know pepeLaugh
[5:01:36] DvOlii: is the XP halved for 2 ppl ?
[5:01:41] xTrueEast: @drajov you dont get it hes saying no one is better and you just answered as if your're superior
[5:01:53] ratehikesnrho: You think the "No labels movement" may steal enough electorate votes for the election; pushed to the House of Representatives for a final decision? Minimum incumbent needs 270 I believe, chance for either party to be mischievous on the hill?
[5:01:59] Garzag_: PauseChamp articulating
[5:02:00] CringeK: My favorite part of morning streams are NA vs EU debates
[5:02:02] Snackboy: Please elaborate peepoHappy
[5:02:14] dreadd39: @Snackboy currently its just communism being masked by Castro Jr pretending to be a democracy
[5:02:19] Metaphix: How do i zay zis... you av' le burger brain oui
[5:02:43] rytrick1988: Canadian politics makes my head spin. All i know is that im getting taxed on the tax i pay that gets taxed again lol
[5:03:13] pancakeofscience: i might actually not be a political movement. "MIght"
[5:03:19] arsenalenjoyer: @drajov PogO
[5:03:19] Snackboy: @Snackboy pepeLaugh i can't even say its not because i know jack shit.
[5:03:30] thoughtcriminal: the nose knows#
[5:03:34] bsom52: Living in EU it is quite different than the US but there are still the same quarrels but the major difference is that things like Medical aren't who has the most money it's a basic need thats given to them however they are taxed at a higher flat rate
[5:03:35] xTrueEast: americans hey man everyone is different and cant say for sure whos best..eu i could see why an american would say that lol project much
[5:03:45] wookieenthal: but why did Dr Disrespect get banned Kappa
[5:04:24] jexxy_ggs: Empty Rhetoric
[5:05:01] fietsopa4: Sadly in NA an ambulance ride will bankrupt your family
[5:05:02] xTrueEast: yeah yeah and you dont defend your own country we do lol
[5:05:03] lilpandybear: i love this song, always with the best tunes
[5:05:07] Metaphix: you can go to the ER in America and get treated no matter what, you just drown in debt
[5:05:26] arsenalenjoyer: because state funded healthcare fucking sucks
[5:05:32] 3verythingatonce: i dont think they do. polls show its a winning topic bilaterally
[5:05:34] Metaphix: multi culturalism, feels like a zero sum game
[5:05:35] jexxy_ggs: Because Americans hate paying taxes and free stuff for other people
[5:05:39] arsenalenjoyer: the level of care is dogshit
[5:05:39] omarali118: I am neither American or European but I think it's because most Americans descend from people who were brave enough to leave nice cities and settle in wilderness
[5:05:40] pancakeofscience: history, they want to do their own thing because it is engrained in the culture
[5:05:42] fart_boiii: yea what he said, states suck
[5:05:43] HeyItsBlumpers: more individualism and less collectivism is baked into our ethos
[5:05:46] dtl78: state cant take care of one single thing except itself
[5:05:49] bannerwow: @arsenalenjoyer Until u have to pay 40k for a cancer treatment
[5:05:49] omarali118: it makes them indepedent

[5:06:08] fart_boiii: state cant do shit but fun the police
[5:06:10] xTrueEast: 37 years never been bankrupted by a hospital yet someone in eu is worried about me

[5:06:12] fart_boiii: fund
[5:06:13] dreadd39: we cant afford a 50% tax
[5:06:14] Metaphix: rugged individualism, not relying on government
[5:06:35] Snackboy: Wait
[5:06:38] Snackboy: HUH
[5:06:39] 3verythingatonce: americans do value and want it but political lobbyists do not and thus it does not happen
[5:06:40] pancakeofscience: in short it is the way it was since america was founded. Independence is a big thing. I think as a dutch person @StaysafeTV
[5:06:41] FryeTV: The American ideology has been brought up as being their own ruler on the pursuit of happiness while EU is used to their kings and queen culture. Allowing their government be much more involved into their lives. I could go into further detail but this is a 1st grade response
[5:06:45] jexxy_ggs: Medical Industry is for Profit and making healthcare universal will cut into profits
[5:06:52] fart_boiii: we can talk
[5:06:53] Metaphix: tell us what you think
[5:07:00] DubPoizon: We believe the the free market and private sector can solve problems better than bureaucratic govt. Unfortunately the fed/dollar system does not allow a free market to exist
[5:07:06] Snackboy: I'm here to listen Madge i'm stupid okay.
[5:07:07] ReDNeQ_tm: 100% Service Connected Disabled Vet. Which Means US Govt is 100% responsible for us. They value us at 40K a year for financial support and healthcare is only for service connected disability.. Nobody understands that simple Question: WHAT IS MY LIFE WORTH TO YOU
[5:07:12] zynnbobway: bASED
[5:07:13] squiiggleVision: us is this way, bc people should have self accountability.  it’s not the government who will fox ur problems.
[5:07:15] Thonie_: I think a lot of time with bad health care made impact, to think that central health care is not worth spending money on.
[5:07:16] thoughtcriminal: still love my american brehren

[5:07:45] Garzag_: that one guy still had nothing to say huh PepeLaugh
[5:07:50] fart_boiii: no the gov wont fix ur problems but the state wouldnt know whats good for people if jesus came down with a book telling us
[5:07:52] xaftoman: "i dont want to pay taxes but i still want to use the state funded roadways"
[5:07:54] SardonicHS: what about taking care of the less fortunate
[5:07:55] biskybiscuit: did you like MOP?
[5:07:56] bsom52: @StaysafeTV you just said what I WAS TYPING!!!
[5:08:03] jexxy_ggs: @ReDNeQ_tm  lucky ... i was rated 0% ... i want frree money :(
[5:08:05] Hensonr1: I wanna pay less in taxes for sure
[5:08:10] The_Crane: I thought servers were down for maintenance. They done already?

[5:08:36] Snackboy: attillSip

[5:08:41] bone555: No culture
[5:08:43] Kr0st22: so true
[5:08:45] bsom52: I think people would rather pay for what they want to pay -> Aka pay less taxes/social security/having to pay things you essentially don't have a choice in and the freedom of choice
[5:08:50] pancakeofscience: i think it also varies a lot from state to state, never been to the US though
[5:08:56] KVAHA: Well spoken btw
[5:08:56] DubPoizon: Yes we rely on the dollar, which the value and permission comes from an unelected body outside of the govt (the fed). How can you be sovereign in that system?
[5:08:57] matthewz92: socialism creates more problems and then it gets into loop of solutions for created problems
[5:08:59] dillyduss: boom
[5:09:00] thoughtcriminal: dude, us are the exact same people as europeans
[5:09:05] bannerwow: Do u think thats the right way to go about things?
[5:09:06] ReDNeQ_tm: @jexxy_ggs how you going to talk to someone that is 100% wanting free money.. this isnt welfare. I served a contract and upheld it and the Govt injured my physical life.. so this is a payment for said damage
[5:09:06] xTrueEast: my end game is land and a bunker so yeah
[5:09:13] bsom52: where EU on the other hand is okay with losing the freedom of choice on certain things and relying on their elected people to support their voice
[5:09:14] zynnbobway: THATS THE REAL AMERICAN DREAM
[5:09:18] arsenalenjoyer: Imagine being dependent on the government for everything
[5:09:19] Skulligan79: ...and unfortunately, our U.S. government can't stand that idea.
[5:09:21] fart_boiii: europeans are less cool and more “hipster”
[5:09:23] rytrick1988: I agree with that to a certain extent. Here in Canada we are reliant on the government to go to the doctor or have any kind of surgery's & we want to be independent, but at the same time we are grateful to not have to spend thousands of dollars to have a basic surgery
[5:09:25] Snackboy: yarrSip interesting.
[5:09:30] dtl78: very few people in the u.s. anymore want to take care of themselves. less than 15% of us still want self reliance and willing to put in work for it
[5:09:32] rocknsake: i agree, and it is unfortunate that companies take advantage of american individualism in the name of profits
[5:09:34] JBurrNasty: @StaysafeTV have you moved to your place in Idaho yet?
[5:09:38] cordozar23: 48% of Americans anyways
[5:09:46] thoughtcriminal: us was founded by europoeans, so we are one
[5:09:55] ReDNeQ_tm: most of us VETS just want to be left alone..
[5:09:58] Lava_in_a_Lamp: Another thing americans do differently, is celebrate success instead of envy it. This is more in the UK than all of Europe.
[5:09:58] dtl78: statism is saddism
[5:10:00] EmanuShow: There was a time in america where white people settled and had nothing to rely on but themselves and those people were proud over that
[5:10:02] JBurrNasty: @StaysafeTV gotcha
[5:10:03] pancakeofscience: we went through some shit mid 1900's. I think that played a part in it as far as the collective goes
[5:10:05] screaching: lies

[5:24:05] clockworkillithid: @kaffe_re_re_reformed It means a global collapse in trade. The US Navy is what makes mass global trade possible, and has since the 50's

[5:25:45] DubPoizon: @StaysafeTV No they dont need to tax you, they dont need your vote either. You will pay for it via higher prices and printed money
[5:25:46] fart_boiii: u can send men
[5:25:47] DINGODOGGERDUDE: imagine if all the tax money went to help improve the nation
[5:25:50] fart_boiii: and count it as money

[5:25:57] clockworkillithid: @Azenics Watch the impacts of the Red Sea issue economically in Europe. It's a big deal, and if the issue was widespread it would be a much bigger deal. If It wasn't an election year boots would be on the ground in Yemen already

[5:27:50] MartianPK: hes young still, long political career
[5:27:50] doctamoose: he def could when hes Bidens age
[5:27:55] piro_d: @biskybiscuit he can't become president, he wasn't born in the US
[5:27:56] mrmangasm: I would over biden easily
[5:28:00] dreadd39: @nearoz123 👃
[5:28:03] sixpackchad: i don't think vivek will ever be president, because his ideas, which would make the US a much better place, are considered too radical by the uniformed populace
[5:28:06] todddiff: who wants to vote for a BIPOC in White country
[5:28:09] todddiff: !vanish
[5:28:15] acey1994: dont you believe trump is too old, same as biden?
[5:28:16] fietsopa4: Just need to wait for Barron Trump
[5:28:17] kaffe_re_re_reformed: @sixpackchad also, he is indian

[5:28:46] MartianPK: Biden v Trump debate today would be just sad to watch
[5:28:51] sixpackchad: @kaffe_re_re_reformed i think him being hindu is a bigger issue for people than him being of indian ancestry
[5:28:51] dontbecold: Ye 2028
[5:28:51] xDoozi: trumps also not bought by every corporation ever
[5:28:58] omarali118: @dreadd39 I agree but I'm saying that because he hates them they won't let him get elected since they control america
[5:29:00] AmarokUnchained: @dreadd39 !
[5:29:01] sniped1414: Imagine we had a real choice besides both of them
[5:29:05] todddiff: @dontbecold YE 2024 BasedGod
[5:29:06] MartianPK: fair
[5:29:08] pancakeofscience: same goes for trump though
[5:29:11] clockworkillithid: I think a leader under the age of 60 would be great for America. The worlds changing fast, and we need someone younger with actual skin in the game making the big decisions at this point.
[5:29:13] 3verythingatonce: @sniped1414 would be so nice
[5:29:16] Hensonr1: @StaysafeTV The biggest thing I'm looking for in the coming election is an "America first" mindset cause Biden has proven to not give a shit
[5:29:19] arsenalenjoyer: Joe Biden is running on fumes right now. Tanks almost empty.
[5:29:22] dika93: joe biden donald trump ResidentSleeper cant listen to this shiit anymore
[5:29:37] DINGODOGGERDUDE: I wonder what kamala's been up to
[5:29:42] sixpackchad: trump is not the same as biden, and i don't just mean political party
[5:29:43] clockworkillithid: Ross Perot scared them to much
[5:29:44] DINGODOGGERDUDE: haven't heard about her recently
[5:29:45] todddiff: @sniped1414 what are the independent candidates are for
[5:29:45] indigolab: democrats didnt even run an election smh
[5:29:45] pisketti: I'm ridin' with Biden 😎 🍨
[5:29:52] thoughtcriminal: biden represents the current state of usa perfectly
[5:29:53] xTrueEast: i notice nordic countries shy away from politcs i wonder if its because all their ''free'' programs rely on the stock market lol
[5:29:54] sixpackchad: biden is a career politician. he has no set of beliefs.
[5:29:54] acey1994: who do you think Trump will pick as Vice President?
[5:29:55] Metaphix: thats exactly why people love him lol
[5:29:56] dreadd39: @StaysafeTV did you see biden is not going to take a cognitive tes tas part of his annual checkup. every president has before him
[5:29:57] dtl78: Hegelian Dialectic
[5:29:57] WarmWetTight: hes gonna drop out and they're going to select a nominee at an open convention. New York Times columnist released podcast calling for it today
[5:30:02] hclark0: hes liked by me
[5:30:04] sniped1414: She would beat biden honestly
[5:30:07] aleck1776: They dont like Ron either though
[5:30:07] todddiff: Sadge women running the country
[5:30:08] POSrobot: Evangelists will be 40% of the US population in 2028, and hispanics will be roughly 45%, so the next Trump will be a Mexican Evangelist, 2028 will be the new puritan movement
[5:30:08] fart_boiii: we need a party that leads us to be nature oriented and focused on the health of the world, thats whats gonna help the world down the line, not anything else
[5:30:14] fishcakexl: From my experience working with elders , Biden is at the point, where he can become a complete vegetable in a matter of weeks
[5:30:18] daijahaden: I wonder what the dems will do for the presidential debates. There's not enough stimulants in the world to make Biden up for that task.
[5:30:20] xDoozi: they all lose money because money doesn't flow freely into defense contractors and big pharma like it does under biden haley etc
[5:30:22] dtl78: no one can ever imagine just making a shit storm to distract the masses
[5:30:23] Metaphix: wtf has the RNC done for us lately? That's why people like Trump

[5:30:41] fart_boiii: bro trump is horrible for nature
[5:30:48] fart_boiii: one reason he sucks
[5:30:48] clockworkillithid: @fart_boiii We should be good stewards of the world we live in. The issue is actually cutting out fossil fuels means killing 6 billion people. Situations a lose/lose
[5:30:50] todddiff: BasedGod NO WOMEN PRESIDENT
[5:30:52] dontbecold: Ridin with Biden MUGA
[5:30:53] minibrophs: stop cappin
[5:30:53] mrmangasm: @DINGODOGGERDUDE thats a great question. You would think if the presidents health and medical issues became national news you would think a vice president would be in the public more
[5:30:53] Kr0st22: trump isnt part of the system, he cant be bought
[5:30:58] omarali118: At least Biden will talk shit to Israel kek

[5:31:11] thoughtcriminal: putin would vote for biden too hahaha
[5:31:13] fart_boiii: @clockworkillithid yea saving the world is top priority, the problem is getting people to see that and focus on that
[5:31:14] novvum: Nikki is more dangerous
[5:31:14] TheGeneralGrant: same with me. we’re team Biden at that point
[5:31:17] Snackboy: Who is that lady yarrSip

[5:31:40] Jurassitol: Would you fuck hikki hailey
[5:31:40] dreadd39: Nimarata is just another hillary
[5:31:46] Metaphix: The ruling class fucking hates us and thinks were retarded while they leach off of us. Trump is a big "fuck you" and they know it, that's why they go after him

[6:40:48] 555artur: @QuestFor420 how much taxes is that
[6:40:55] Avenia: @bottlekiddz thats nothing.
[6:40:55] MykeyP: @StaysafeTV at least my children will have bis'd out characters to play when im gone EZ
[6:41:02] nearoz123: the change over to cbdc will ruin people with the money

[6:41:14] DanPenaa: what is it. tell us
[6:41:19] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: you're in a lucky situation staysafe lol many people envy it and try to copy it..
[6:41:24] chamlet2764: Id figure if you set your child up for success with the way you raised them then thats enough. Anything else is extra
[6:41:30] abarrow_: They SHOULD have an obligation
[6:41:33] zezella03: I am not leaving shit for Destiny everything I have is being given to Raven.
[6:41:42] QuestFor420: 1000%

[6:42:03] h3avybag: @StaysafeTV american boomers can't fathom the concept of not forcing their children out of the house at 16 and cutting off all support starting at 18
[6:42:05] QuestFor420: im much too selfish for kids
[6:42:09] EmanuShow: Why spend it all on instant gratification that last five seconds when one save for ones children
[6:42:13] Snackboy: yarrSip
[6:42:23] TheEndIsNear777: i'm not ready for kids :(
[6:42:37] nearoz123: shave
[6:42:40] Avenia: my dad is fucking loaded, i wont see a cent of that money, Ive had to work for all mine, and ill do the same to my children.
[6:42:40] arsenalenjoyer: You would think all parents would prioritize that but unfortunately that doesnt seem to be the case
[6:42:41] caltex88: Based. Procreation Pillr
[6:42:43] zezella03: while I live I will help Destiny out as much as I can but when I die it goes to Raven
[6:42:44] bottlekiddz: i mean thats going to be hard. QOL is steadily decreasing. 10 years from now air travel will be restricted, traveling by vehicle will be too cost prohibitive
[6:42:44] 3verythingatonce: I think part of that is also being on your A game for your kid which means self care
[6:42:49] bluejayzee: is One True King still active?
[6:42:54] chamlet2764: @StaysafeTV i agree. I just dont think there is an obligation to have a huge oile of money saved up to give your child after they die. Raising them rigth and setting them up for success is enough
[6:43:06] carlos_dang3r: imagine kicking your kids out of the house and hoping they struggle financially LUL
[6:43:11] TheEndIsNear777: @Avenia that's continuing the "Chain" of that type of parenting
[6:43:20] h3avybag: @carlos_dang3r literally the American mindset
[6:43:27] Avenia: @TheEndIsNear777 yeah and its the form i support
[6:43:35] TheEndIsNear777: @Avenia :O
[6:43:47] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: @h3avybag not at all, not whatsoever.
[6:43:55] Avenia: You arent here to setup a good life for your children
[6:44:02] Avenia: They could turn out to be utter pieces of shit
[6:44:16] StaysafeTV: hello
[6:44:20] carlos_dang3r: @h3avybag I think it will change with the generational shift
[6:44:24] TheEndIsNear777: If they turn out to be POS that's on them, im gonna do my part to raise them and bless them

[6:46:31] dramaqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq: @h3avybag there are many parents that even keep their transexual kids around and nurture them today.  Your argument is false

[7:12:17] dirbagdan: you have to be a big streamer for youtube
[7:12:24] dirbagdan: like timthetatman
[7:12:27] Mr_Moffert: @Effen13 yea i skipped off the lil p train
[7:12:38] Shocklate_: brand deals is where its at
[7:12:45] Eepingmoo: !gum

[7:15:20] Peoplewhinetoomuch: Nice nice
[7:15:22] fishcakexl: Where is the solo SM invitationals NODDERS
[7:15:28] NotDessx: Dorki!!!! AMRICAS LAST HOPE
[7:15:43] dogecodesyt: why dont u just ask viewers to give you gold?
[7:15:43] dirbagdan: tbh id rather watch competitive pve than retail pvp. retail pvp is retarded. you do like no damage to anyone for 30 minutes and then you can burst, and if 1 person dies the fight is over wooooow
[7:15:45] Lunights: nice, looks like it starting to drop now so that was a good stonks move
[7:15:55] DvOlii: whats the point of Honor in SoD , u cant buy anythign with that
[7:15:58] TwoDancingLobsters: I have over 100 winter squid you think prices will go up a lot in p3 when we cant get them anymore?
[7:16:04] dirbagdan: @DvOlii yet
[7:16:28] eaiBruxao: u can show ur build? talents and runes pls
[7:17:13] leech0000: when you were solo grinding it leveling up did you go afflic?
[7:17:25] pkprell: @StaysafeTV Did you see the Hunter Cathedral boosting?
[7:17:40] pkprell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-R8xbRmSqY - It is insane
[7:17:58] pkprell: It's a 1 pull, looks nutters
[7:18:26] xxlegitghostxx: if you use 3 at lvl 39 you get half a lvl of rested
[7:18:32] aleck1776: Looks like mages
[7:18:46] malefic918: Just coming back form SOD phase 1. What all did i miss food xp buff sleeping bags what?
[7:19:16] pkprell: Isn't it worth saving them for 40-50 phase? Or is it a level cap on the item itself?
[7:19:17] Katorac: Staysafe, do you think it's safe to travel to Russia to visit a woman I met online?
[7:19:25] fatwesker: Can you save the buff food till ~57
[7:19:32] fghtingspirit_2022: I didnt know what they were and sold them to the vendors, doh
[7:19:34] fatwesker: :(
[7:19:36] rbo2992: whys that?
[7:19:49] neomonstr: @pkprell 40-50 we'll all likely be in ZF for less than 1 day and be done anyway LUL
[7:19:55] cheetobbob: where the secret spot to farm p2 waylaid crates
[7:20:02] pkprell: At least we'll get the 3% sleeping bag for the 40-42 cathedral into 42-50 ZF xD
[7:20:07] don_kneee: didnt the crates work lmao
[7:20:07] pkprell: @neomonstr True
[7:20:11] rbo2992: yeah but the nuts are limited
[7:20:21] rbo2992: you om;y get 8
[7:20:27] BlackPhoeniix: the rested xp you had on 39 went over to p2
[7:20:35] obee0: iam doing sleeping bag quest on a lvl 40 right now, so i should delete them then :dddx
[7:20:45] Raivan994: but someone joining the game later on would be penalized then
[7:20:45] realgypso: What about troll necklaces...RIP?
[7:20:46] BlackPhoeniix: so if you spam all food items at 39 99% and then level you should have the rested xp for p3
[7:20:55] pendisnuts: Im stocking up on troll tribal necklaces for cheap just incase it slips through the cracks
[7:20:57] rbo2992: definitely higher than 0% chance tho
[7:20:59] dirbagdan: catch fish that have buffs YEP
[7:21:03] Lunights: yeah wish they did something with fishing
[7:21:06] dirbagdan: porfessions are so slept on
[7:21:13] BlackPhoeniix: it worked that way in p2 tho
[7:21:14] neomonstr: @pkprell we might even go directly into ZF, seeing as we'll be geared to the teeth and even have hit gear, we'll see what happens :p
[7:21:15] rsSilence: Some new rare fish and recipes for them would be a fun addition
[7:21:34] Raivan994: you kept the rested you had
[7:21:34] BlackPhoeniix: yea but if people stacked rested xp on lvl 24 they had it going into p2
[7:21:46] BlackPhoeniix: its been documented
[7:21:50] MykeyP: U
[7:21:51] mattbarz989: I had rested on chars I didn't play before p2 I'm pretty sure
[7:21:51] gryphsx: you get rested and then level. I had 149% of rested at the start of p2
[7:22:19] MykeyP: I had like 40% rested xp on my druid when i logged on p2 launch
[7:22:22] dirbagdan: I also had rested at the start. Not much
[7:22:30] BlackPhoeniix: yea they probably will fix it for p3 since people found out for p2
[7:22:42] rsSilence: I love the fact that you can pretty much passively level alts by doing a BFD every 3 days, that's such a nice feature
[7:22:44] Robbtuck: sstvWAT
[7:23:49] Doribob1: shamorse?
[7:23:59] sirlewis_: nah
[7:24:00] neomonstr: Not really
[7:24:02] fghtingspirit_2022: Nah
[7:24:03] Rmont: maybe if you hit the staff
[7:24:04] ouch55: no its 35k exp
[7:24:04] Tripxx1: if you get summon
[7:24:06] pkprell: BFD is only what, 23k? 25min run + essembling is not worth it
[7:24:08] Tripxx1: and summon yourself back
[7:24:10] LeagueIsBetterThanSC2: @StaysafeTV can you please do gnomergard? i havent seen the raid yet.
[7:24:14] MykeyP: Maybe if you still need gear
[7:24:14] cheetobbob: i got 3/4 of lvl at lvl 28 just now
[7:24:16] PazokiTV: not worth
[7:24:19] atlasglassstudio: with summons and a quick grp.
[7:24:28] Rmont: wont get trash exp at your level
[7:24:29] ouch55: only worth if you need items
[7:24:33] pkprell: Isn't it 3k per boss = 21k, except Akumai gives 5k
[7:24:40] rsSilence: Yeah I don't think BFD is worth it if you're actively leveling something but being able to stack rested and run them on other characters is very cool
[7:24:43] Doribob1: did you not use the student fodder?
[7:24:52] ouch55: or if your bored out of your mind from sm and need a break :D
[7:24:54] abruptdecayO_O: KEKW
[7:24:58] Doribob1: my b
[7:25:01] Shadusion: @StaysafeTV I've found a ledge to abuse in Uldaman for insane gold. Had to respec into pet sac for the sustain tho
[7:25:04] cheetobbob: it may be worth if a group looking for 1 more dps and sum rdy so no down time
[7:25:06] Doribob1: i was talking to my wife
[7:25:23] neomonstr: is the BFD boss exp doubled by using fodder though? if so then those 2 last bosses could be 20k combined EZ
[7:25:24] endraga1: but the student fodder tho SCHIZO
[7:25:54] CringeK: Why aren't you reacting to the MDI? Madge
[7:26:09] Shadusion: @StaysafeTV If Pendulum of doom drops and i can sell my gold for a royal estate on a hill i'll think of what you did for me lmao
[7:26:25] aleck1776: That was aweful
[7:26:35] imradioaktive: shit everywhere

[7:27:25] RanciusAdventures: just saying, I love this stream time today 👌
[7:27:25] PP_Diff: I mean it can be a lot, but retail pvp is very fun
[7:28:04] WillowJane: allo
[7:28:05] MacBadga: is it worth soloing scarlet monastery ?
[7:28:06] aleck1776: Madge Locked
[7:28:07] Shadusion: @StaysafeTV I logged out after my raid couldnt kill first boss of Gnomer. Now i'm locked, since they went 3/6 while i was offline. ALWAYS RUN OUT (just letting you know)
[7:28:18] cheetobbob: are there sellable engineer locks to open locked stuff?
[7:28:28] Raivan994: how

[7:28:53] Robbtuck: @shadusion should of left honorably instead of ninja afking lol
[7:28:53] bjstince: LFM GNOMER 3/6
[7:29:00] Razor9mm: My guild cleared Gnomer night 1 going in blind to all the fights. It was easier than BFD night 1 lol
[7:29:01] Shadusion: I left group and logged @Robbtuck
[7:29:10] WillowJane: i looked it up and gnomer has more kills week 1 than halion has had in 1 month lmao
[7:29:26] neomonstr: I've always been a hardcore raider, but after BFD I dont even feel like doing gnomer LUL
[7:29:53] MacBadga: @staysafetv is it worth soloing SM?

[7:31:42] aleck1776: Idk that @lizcat_  gal is pretty crazy in chat
[7:31:47] WillowJane: are you vendoring everything or doing AH runs?
[7:31:51] lethalkingr: guys melee hunter or ele shaman?
[7:31:51] ultimoos: Hey chat, do warlock pets scale with stats? seems to be an impossible question to get answered
[7:31:52] Shadusion: @MacBadga If you send a voidwalker in for the sheep he will just stare at it (warlock here)
[7:32:01] neomonstr: Currently leveling my own druid by questing, it's surprisingly satisfying atm tbh
[7:32:13] MacBadga: @shadusion oh that’s wierd
[7:32:32] MacBadga: @shadusion I’m a lock too
[7:32:35] jfauxy23: no underworld bands??
[7:32:51] ultimoos: Well I guess no one can be bothered replying
[7:32:55] Shadusion: @MacBadga Like the sheep will move, but he'll take MAYBE 3-6 steps every half a minute. Like i had him stuck in the middle for our entire 2:30 kill first reset. it was jokes

[7:55:33] coolcoolcool777dood: its so obvious that the Christian God is the true God.. literally every near death experience on the internet is Christian based no matter where they are from and the internet has not been out that long.. like its happening all over the world more than ever, not just in english speaking places!!*** had to fix some typos in it

[7:56:24] Bigcricket: YEP Old Testiment
[7:56:31] bazzzgg: Is that was the old test is? thats what the jews believe? i didnt know that
[7:56:31] Utmost777: If you read Leviticus you will see that a lot of the laws were meant to keep them safe in a world with very little sanitation
[7:56:38] 3verythingatonce: book of enoch was to real
[7:56:40] mushlove420: Book of Enoch

[7:57:31] bazzzgg: REVEAL YOUR SECRET RELIGION SO WE CAN JUDGE YOU
[7:57:35] Atb50: The council of Nicaea did not canonized a single book of the Bible it wasn’t even a discussion.
[7:57:48] supernapkin: THE SACRED TEXTS
[7:57:50] thoughtcriminal: just the ordinaces of sacrifice were abolished, because Jesus was the perfect sacrifice, all other laws remain for eternity

[7:59:05] coolcoolcool777dood: 100% staysafe
[7:59:13] clockworkillithid: It was a reponse to Gnostic ideas
[7:59:13] TwoDancingLobsters: how can a Christianity guide morals if their own morals change throughout the years? Slavery for instance is a big example, weird god was like JK bros in the new testament and everyone doesn't think about the inconsistency.
[7:59:15] fortmax98: It was which ones were best to control people
[7:59:23] numblezzz: every group and city was say different shit, it was done out of necessity to create some uniformity
[7:59:41] Atb50: The council of Nicaea was to deal with the Aryan crisis, and the date of Easter again not a single book was canonized nor discussed
[7:59:43] coolcoolcool777dood: im so curious how u feel about this: its so obvious that the Christian God is the true God.. literally every near death experience on the internet is Christian based no matter where they are from and the internet has not been out that long.. like its happening all over the world more than ever, not just in english speaking places!!
[7:59:47] Utmost777: The goal of the Bible is to point to Christ and his grace. It is the Gospel, nothing more. Just because a text was good for instruction was not enough to include it.
[7:59:48] averagedustygamer: how was slavery condoned in the OT? @TwoDancingLobsters
[7:59:55] bazzzgg: Do you know who Vaush is @StaysafeTV ? did u see the drama lol

[8:00:35] omarali118: Is Vaush Jewish?
[8:00:37] margothon: FUNNY THAT
[8:00:41] fortmax98: Vaush is more communist than Hasan?

[8:00:42] WellWellWell77: most sane communist
[8:00:42] mintcookie_vajankle: How you gonna be into both horses and children
[8:00:43] dogecodesyt: god doesnt want you to follow him he wants you to find him when you are at your lowest
[8:00:48] novvum: Vaush is a child predator too
[8:00:56] CringeK: It's been a known thing for years now. Anyone who continued to have a positive Vaush opinion was just ignorant
[8:00:56] Batresh: Communists are mentally ill selfloathing people. You cant reason with them. U can only enslave them
[8:00:56] omarali118: @bazzzgg Maybe he's Jewish
[8:00:58] carlos_the_7th: @coolcoolcool777dood the generalisation here is quite dumb, at least someone in this Earth has had a NDE not related to christianity
[8:01:11] novvum: Idk why people support him or defend him
[8:01:13] bazzzgg: Oh, maybe
[8:01:18] doctor4ir: @Batresh dame 12hrs of communist talk
[8:01:19] naughtiemares: Thats fuckin bizarre
[8:01:21] Advice305: I am having a hard time motivating myself to play SOD phase 2, I started to dungeon grind but kinda got bored. I wish they would have added quests to make questing more fun and viable.
[8:01:24] Utmost777: YouTube loves their Pedos?
[8:01:26] DanPenaa: communists always have something weird with kids. lunatics. lock them up
[8:01:27] naughtiemares: That your mind can get that twisted
[8:01:32] coolcoolcool777dood: @carlos_the_7th yeah i should say 95% sorry
[8:01:48] theboosh7: lmao fr
[8:01:50] sweetleaf_: for real its not a job
[8:01:57] bazzzgg: and then that other guy Hassan is allowed to be on twitch after saying 9/11 was justified. the world has gone nuts
[8:01:59] Moo360: yeah take a break and then u'll either get motivated again or not... both are fine
[8:02:07] naughtiemares: I was feeling like that too so I been taking a break for the last day

[8:03:22] TwoDancingLobsters: @duzty02 Leviticus 19:20-22 is one of my favs. There are many passages that talk about the proper way to treat a slave. I just cant wrap my head around ignoring the moral inconsistencies
[8:03:26] numblezzz: i care what other people believe Madge
[8:03:26] trump2024_yep: exactly

[8:04:25] naughtiemares: bepis
[8:04:26] carlos_the_7th: @GilgameshRebirth7 You're stuck in dualistic thought, good and evil are human concepts and God is supposed to be above -- as such, you may not understand why those things happen but then again you are nowhere near as all-understanding as God
[8:04:29] margothon: HES A WARLOCK DUMMY
[8:04:39] Utmost777: we like you too
[8:04:39] averagedustygamer: and the part where Jesus was sent to free us from being slaves to sin @TwoDancingLobsters

[8:06:07] willys_pinballpub: Oregon is a hot spot. Lots of tournaments
[8:06:08] averagedustygamer: Theology and context is crucial when reading scripture. Understanding the times and how society functioned. You cant just read abstractly and apply it as functional in today's society

[8:07:20] Meltim: What's your k/d ratio?
[8:07:28] TwoDancingLobsters: @duzty02 if god is eternal so should the morality he is teaching. By saying you have to look at the bible with historical context you agree that morality is based on man and not god.

[8:10:27] sothis666: this dude is trying to use a canned argument lol
[8:10:38] blueboywiz: based muslem staysafe
[8:10:40] averagedustygamer: @kw3nk read the book of Romans. All humans were made aware of God since the beginning of time and we chose depravity in idolatry. That despite God making himself known, we chose our own ways...
