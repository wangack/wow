[0:35:49] DecayedmiNt: He gets to return to all his original stuff too.
[0:35:55] PoppaShot: does like the account bound like mounts and stuff still count?

[0:37:23] BoldrinXX: So you and Sloot just going to run double tank in NA keys???
[0:37:24] AZnEriC: nope.. Brady is winning it all. Chiefs is gimped. Without there starting center > there 3-3

[0:45:36] BlackSnake100: havent known anyone to swap back
[0:45:50] Aidler: I thought you can't transfer between regions??
[0:46:10] Anguyen92ab: I almost considered switching back to Night Fae from Necrolord, but once i realized how good the covenent powers were in Torghast, I changed my mind.
[0:46:31] MOLAR305: it's heroic not mythic
[0:46:31] PotbellyGoat: @Aidler you can't, he's moving from one NA server to another
[0:47:01] MOLAR305: with your gear I wouldn't stress a butt pull lol
[0:47:15] Aidler: @Potbelly_Jenkins but sloot was on a EU server so far.... or not?
[0:47:26] Anguyen92ab: He had characters from NA servers
[0:47:36] Crowargus: he was originally on na servers before eu
[0:47:47] PotbellyGoat: @Aidler Yes- he will switch from his EU account to his NA one and then additionally swap from one NA server to another

[0:50:27] MOLAR305: my guess is mald bc of kel'thuzzad
[0:50:28] Daggerstry: I hope the next raid is Ardenweald
[0:50:29] Thadune: @Towelliee Maldraxxus or Ardenwald I think

[1:04:31] Masqerader: Their Plaguefall hurt
[1:04:32] Thadune: I think it doesnt help being on youtube still.. plus MDI is just so stale
[1:04:36] fruitvendorx: Def ditching SL for TBC then
[1:04:53] elfwyn20: @Towelliee kyrian is better for prot now or you still think venthyr is better?
[1:05:01] Adam__Aster: BLIZZARD STOCK TO THE MOOOOON ConcernDoge
[1:05:16] Masqerader: What I hate about the MDI is you know Youtube paid them a good amount of money and Blizzard prize award is pennies in comparison
[1:05:31] Adam__Aster: i bought into some covid vaccine stock :)
[1:05:33] Daggerstry: They don't transfer to the TBC server would be my guess, just start over
[1:05:38] Sollice: D2 remaster and Immortal

[1:08:38] Masqerader: he is the only mechanic lol
[1:09:04] othraerir: off topic, were there any new followers from torghast this week?

[1:12:44] TheFuriyon: the 1k anima and souls?
[1:12:52] anygrinders: yeah the souls and anima weekly
[1:12:55] anygrinders: okay
[1:13:02] Thadune: thats what they mean by weekly
[1:13:18] Ryok: you have to remember to do the campaign quests as you catchup or renown stops dropping, i did all of lfr and got no renown while at 22 and having the last campaign quest chain left
[1:13:23] TheFuriyon: tbf I think the fastest way to get renown might just be to spam arenas
[1:13:24] Hybriso: that just isn't true, i have campaign quests available and am getting renown levels from calling boxes
[1:13:25] MOLAR305: posted it earlier, don't want to get time-out for repeating same link
[1:14:04] anygrinders: @Hybriso if thats the case they might have changed it up, its a few ago i pushed my alt
[1:14:19] anygrinders: *few weeks
[1:14:47] Ryok: i did all 10 bosses on lfr and 4 M0 without getting any renown until after i did the last part of the quest chain
[1:15:13] anygrinders: @Ryok thats exactly the same experience i had
[1:15:16] Thadune: Ya but that was a fresh character right? Not when swapping covenants.. might be different
[1:15:18] Uutef: but your druid wasn't locked to anything
[1:15:30] Lexi__Marie: are you taking into account the renown you get from the campaign
[1:15:31] Kaykerrs: Holy shizz it's Towellie without a beard
[1:15:34] Ryok: i switched covenant from venthyr to kyrian
[1:15:35] Highhvoltage21: my main took forever to get renown when i switched, but now my 3rd alt is already at 12 and i just hit 60
[1:16:05] Kaykerrs: Haven't been in the str eam a few days, wasn't expecting babyface @Towelliee
[1:16:10] Rygothx: Do you lose your mission table companions, etc?
[1:16:12] Maruika: divine toll just seems so good especially as holy compared to other cov abilities
[1:16:20] Lexi__Marie: you're at what renown 12?
[1:16:21] Daggerstry: I just level alts in other covenants when I get bored xD
[1:16:26] MOLAR305: and still no ember court for towelliee ;)
[1:16:37] Ryok: interestingly enough if you have the dagger backpiece saved in a mog set you can still mog it when not being venthyr anymore
[1:17:15] Ryok: but if you look through the back mogs it doesn't show up
[1:17:21] richardmu: @Towelliee why did you left?
[1:17:22] Daggerstry: Now he gets to do the Trial of Ascension (even worse imo)

[1:18:48] Lexi__Marie: i guess im too dumb to understand the trial of ascension
[1:18:58] miroc228: its spires not trial
[1:19:57] propoopimus: how does he still have venthyr transmog as kyrian?
[1:19:58] Daggerstry: @miroc228 We were talking about the Kyrian covenant special.....

[1:23:05] Apokolipz: once i can choose my covenant im going maldraxxus for my dh he feels at home there

[1:26:26] bennythejet_ne: Good point it was a clean run man no wipes hunter did die a few times though maybe I pulled too conservative but yeah a lot of variables
[1:26:49] Sollice: It shouldnt be hunters fault anymore since no one runs barrage
[1:26:57] SeleneVoelkerVT: I never get why people dont stack. my guild does it all the time
[1:26:58] Thadune: hunter pets without stealth pulling extra mobs
[1:27:12] KnsWoW: KEKW
[1:27:23] othraerir: soon to be 105!
[1:27:25] Madman__tv: LOL
[1:27:27] Thadune: 105?
[1:27:39] Masqerader: we almost lot a timed key today cause someone got yeeted in TOP and they didn't die, and couldn't kill themselves so we had to 4 man it while they hearthed and ran back lol
[1:27:48] TheFuriyon: I think it's 1180 for a 10/10 run
[1:27:53] othraerir: 105 and 175 for last 2
[1:27:55] Malnar1123: It is...it said a full clear nets you 1180 anima
[1:27:58] Mockle: give me 1.5k anima and it wouldnt make the slightest difference
[1:28:18] AgentWhiskeyy: Why the switch to kyrian?
[1:28:18] Masqerader: they buffing the wrong thing though, buff that loot yo
[1:28:20] SeleneVoelkerVT: I think we get like what 1150 for the whole raid?
[1:28:28] keninhb: Good evening from Huntington Beach Towe
[1:29:04] Fl3tchTTV: your orbs are smaller, and dont drop all at once, they trickle out
[1:29:12] Thadune: Pepegos spits orbs out
[1:29:13] SeleneVoelkerVT: I just finished lfr today so i got the bonus 2500 anima from end of story stuff

[1:30:53] AgentWhiskeyy: Is kyrian better ?
[1:31:04] Apokolipz: monkaSoap
[1:31:07] Thadune: Depends on play style, but I think so
[1:31:27] Tru1485: you need to kill sire to get the bolvar quest

[1:31:40] Rag_Nasty: Yo what map addon is that?
[1:31:51] alextheory_: sounds like a great mechanic
[1:31:59] fallowing_deer: @Towelliee no, there is a story quest granting 2500 anima for killing denathrius
[1:32:03] Thadune: @Towelliee usually ur callings give renown as well
[1:32:20] Daggerstry: @Thadune Unless they doubled it, it only have 1250 a week ago
[1:32:32] Thadune: ?
[1:32:42] ExtreemeCheese: There is some renown that you can only get from your campaign
[1:32:48] SeleneVoelkerVT: 1250 for the sword then 1250 for the jailer stuff
[1:32:53] anygrinders: there is no cap beside the one general cap which is 30 as of rn
[1:33:00] ExtreemeCheese: So the soft cap is the current cap minus the renown you haven't gotten from campaign
[1:33:00] Fl3tchTTV: chance goes down as your renown goes up, the easier the content the lower the cahcnce
[1:33:04] TheFuriyon: I've had time where I've had renown multiple times a day, whereas other times I've gone multiple dungeons without getting it
[1:33:05] Sollice: @Towelliee Not sure why your not getting reknown from these dungeons? I just got 3
[1:33:09] FruckAwesome: took me roughly a week to go 0-30 renown
[1:33:18] bennythejet_ne: How are you liking divine toll? I am jealous if the dps venth prot has
[1:33:22] manis_tv: ur gonna have to do the story sooner or later
[1:33:24] Sollice: 1 from this and 2 from before
[1:33:25] AgentWhiskeyy: Is kyrian the move now for pallies?
[1:33:34] PidiaP: Kyrian DansGame
[1:33:37] Fl3tchTTV: lfr is good for it tho
[1:33:38] SeleneVoelkerVT: I think it is like a 50 or 60% chance of reknown drops if I recall
[1:33:42] TheFuriyon: what the fuck am I writing? EU tiredness is kicking in
[1:33:44] Kinghorn: last boss
[1:33:45] Sollice: I think last bosses
[1:33:53] Rygothx: Are you going to bother doing the mission tables Towelliee or nah?
[1:34:08] big808: I got a good amount from LFR too
[1:34:10] alextheory_: or just any keys not M0
[1:34:16] Thadune: @Towelliee The fact that Alex Smith didnt win comeback player of the year unanimously is a joke.. someone voted for Big Ben..
[1:34:18] monute316: lox keys like 8 and 9
[1:34:35] LGilbert1982: When I switched my monk to kyrian it took me longer than when I switched my shaman to necrolord, b/c I made the mistake of turning in my weeklies and locked myself until the next weekly reset.
[1:34:36] TheFuriyon: I think the best way to get missing followers is from TC.
[1:34:39] HaloS23: do you have to update the mission table addon every week?
[1:34:43] monute316: low
[1:35:10] Ryok: @LGilbert1982 i made the same mistake xD stuck at 28

[1:36:15] alextheory_: WARRRIOR NECROLORD??!?!?!?!
[1:36:41] SilverAlix: Do you restart the campaign quests too when switching covenants?? They give renoun too
[1:36:45] SeleneVoelkerVT: interesting.... I though like only dks do necrolords
[1:36:46] Audiodisaster: towelliee at night! what a treet! :)
[1:36:51] TheFuriyon: Have you thought about getting 3 other paladins for the 3 remaining covenants?
[1:37:15] bennythejet_ne: Thoughts on avengers shield leggo versus SOR leggo for high keys
[1:37:16] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee bajheera did NF warrior
[1:37:17] railroad10989: Baj is i think
[1:37:19] TheFuriyon: Night Fae fury is the best covenant for high m+

[1:39:36] TheFuriyon: gotta go out and reset
[1:39:57] TheFuriyon: I've had that happen during week 1 of m0s
[1:40:10] othraerir: beta bug, and still in the game, nice
[1:40:27] Complete_Phased: I just kinda hate that to be competitive for certain specs i have to sacrifice playing a covenant i have no interest in. Like whose first thought was Nightfae Warlock
[1:40:53] yokai_5: man jesus christ sanguine depth this week is just awful
[1:41:49] TheFuriyon: If I want to be truly competitive in m+ with my warrior, I'd have to go night fae. Warriors and fairy shit just doesn't mix

[1:46:31] NetherRegion: PE was underrated
[1:46:58] SoulGasoline: PE came out in a time where Square literally could not make a bad game
[1:47:00] SeleneVoelkerVT: I've probably spent $500 on the simpson arcade game over the years
[1:47:04] Horseweave: It wasn't as big as TMNT Arcade though...
[1:47:04] SoulGasoline: everything they made was a hit
[1:47:08] Ryok: sadly PE 1 never came out here D: we only got 2, which is why i like 2 more but i still love 1 ^^
[1:47:21] SoulGasoline: Yeah PE2 was a little wonky
[1:47:31] Daggerstry: They pulled EVERYTHING
[1:47:50] Complete_Phased: Ive played Parasite Eve 2 and 3rd Birthday like 2 weeks ago and holy crap are they both such bad games compared to PE1
[1:47:58] yokai_5: does epic battleground give guaranteed renawn every time ? or wow forums plebs at it again ?
[1:48:02] SeleneVoelkerVT: pull ALL the things!!!!
[1:48:09] SoulGasoline: Third Birthday was such a letdown
[1:48:10] Ryok: yeah but germany didn't ^^
[1:48:28] SoulGasoline: we waited so long for another PE game and we got THAT.
[1:48:34] Complete_Phased: 3rd Birthday has fun gameplay but the story is a dumpster fire
[1:48:46] Horseweave: when's Beyond Good and Evil 2?!
[1:49:01] reeohm: you happy about peyton?
[1:49:02] yokai_5: i have read some of people comments saying the fastest way to get renawn is by doing epic bgs
[1:49:03] Kinghorn: comes out the same day as half life 3 Horseweave
[1:49:07] Ryok: @Setsugekka_ sadly that's what happens when you lose the rights to basically everything the game was built on ^^' i still enjoyed 3rd birthday but would i play it again? maybe in 10 years
[1:49:10] Daggerstry: @Towelliee Did the Venthyr campaign seem unfinished to you? Not getting all the medallions or seeing him wear the crown....
[1:49:26] Daismoon: Did Sloot give you a clue when he was coming back?
[1:49:38] Kinghorn: he tweeted when he is coming back Daismoon
[1:49:40] Vile_: @Daismoon Sloot's coming back Feb. 8th.
[1:49:41] Ryok: he tweeted it @Daismoon i think on monday
[1:49:45] SeleneVoelkerVT: big bears are big
[1:50:06] SoulGasoline: @Ryok Yeah I mean it being a PSP game and knowing how the PSP was treated by most devs I didn't really have high hopes for it
[1:50:26] SoulGasoline: PSP had some real gems but most of it was just bleh
[1:50:31] Kinghorn: the psp and vita were great if you were a big ol weeb cobaltAYAYA
[1:50:39] SoulGasoline: lol yeah King
[1:51:12] SeleneVoelkerVT: nightfae felt pretty complete for the current patch
[1:51:28] SoulGasoline: I loved my PSP though. Really nice handheld especially if you got into loading emulators and stuff on it

[1:51:47] KillaFin: My planet needs me Kappa
[1:51:48] Horseweave: UGH
[1:51:52] SoulGasoline: I can't stand Kyrian. Everything about it annoys me
[1:51:58] denflup: DOGE to the moon baby
[1:52:08] Kinghorn: EZ Clap
[1:52:09] Aro725: the kyrian and necro ones were like the same thing and some revendreth

[1:52:31] yokai_5: so far the best story is nightfae you get to see some fat dragon tites
[1:52:34] SoulGasoline: yeah the overlapping quests.
[1:52:40] KillaFin: Revendreth: "go across the entire map for an epic party" Kappa
[1:52:42] Kinghorn: yeah there is a lot of crossover between the three
[1:52:48] Kinghorn: night fae was its own thing
[1:52:50] swampt1l: Yup
[1:52:51] Aro725: exactly
[1:52:59] Thoreya: yeah its lame
[1:53:03] TheFuriyon: everyone bar NF goes to maldraxxus I think?
[1:53:06] deputydog803: Definitely. im going through it right now
[1:53:09] SoulGasoline: there's one part of both Necro and Kyrian that are the EXACT same quests. It's such lazy design
[1:53:17] swampt1l: i was wondering why tf i was in maldraxxus the whole time lmao
[1:53:26] yokai_5: venthyr story was lame too , didnt like it
[1:53:35] alextheory_: i mean venthyr also fight there
[1:53:42] borisdic: does all the campaign lead to mald?
[1:53:43] alextheory_: Everyone hate necrolord
[1:53:51] SeleneVoelkerVT: only difference between necro and kyrian is one keeps their memories and the other doesn't
[1:53:58] anygrinders: it all will make sense once the story is completed at the end of the expansion
[1:54:01] swampt1l: have you done lfr
[1:54:11] Daggerstry: Venthyr also had you go to Maldraxxus. Seems like next raid might be Maldraxxus as the only covenant I haven't been able to confirm interacts with it is NF
[1:54:24] swampt1l: i got alot of renown from mythic 2s LUL
[1:54:30] SoulGasoline: oh about jamming dildos in your ass or whatever
[1:54:31] Aro725: i went from 0 to 25 in like a day and a half on a shaman alt. the 25-30 was super rng and took me a while
[1:54:31] Kinghorn: I put the link in your sub channel discord @Towelliee
[1:54:38] Chris_127: farming renown seems like farming legos in legion lol
[1:54:44] tenassity69: @towelliee why’d you swap?
[1:54:57] ZetherTV: WeSmart
[1:55:19] KillaFin: raid order Kyrian > maldraxxus > kyrian > night fae > jailer
[1:55:20] alextheory_: he could have said a reference to game that play only meta class in tourney like R6 or LoL
[1:55:46] KillaFin: venthir was 1st lol
[1:55:48] alextheory_: lul

[2:00:39] Daggerstry: Bro, I already fought Uther MULTIPLE times as a Kyrian
[2:01:07] Horseweave: How F***ed up would it be if Anduin's Father was a Boss in Maldraxxis Raid?
[2:01:23] SeleneVoelkerVT: I'd laugh my ass off ngl
[2:01:30] anygrinders: i think the last raid will take place in the maw, there story around is too big and all the named npc's
[2:01:37] SeleneVoelkerVT: but it aint possible guldian destroyed his soul
[2:01:56] Ablackdruid: @Horseweave so apparently people killed by fel magic have their souls destroyed.

[2:03:18] keninhb: Worst zone ever - The Maw
[2:03:19] Kinghorn: yeah end of THIS story
[2:03:20] Horseweave: @helenacostello Alright then, the next target: Liam Greymane, Genn's Son.

[3:16:31] Lexi__Marie: theres probably gonna be a point where you have to do the campaign?
[3:17:06] ItsToxicQT: yea thats what i ment

[3:24:31] ItsToxicQT: for the cup
[3:24:57] TheCliffyShow: Hi, everybody!
[3:25:17] ItsToxicQT: China has their own cup for some reason idr why
[3:25:20] TheCliffyShow: Surprised to see you on at this time.
[3:25:35] Aidler: not global. only NA and EU is together now
[3:25:55] ItsToxicQT: @Aidler its called the Global cup
[3:26:13] Aidler: hmm confusing

[3:26:16] Plague_GG: That’s confusing @itstoxicqt
[3:26:24] bettersnekos: @Towelliee u should have more viewers, always quality streams
[3:26:33] ItsToxicQT: its Echo vs perplexed upper bracket and loser bracket Does Gargoyle Stream? vs PI me @Towelliee
[3:26:46] TheCliffyShow: Towelliee's character can barely fit through those tunnels.
[3:26:46] jure__: china has separate two cups and at the end they should be fighting EU&NA for the title
[3:27:09] ItsToxicQT: yea tons of teams on the china bracket just did a bunch of no shows
[3:27:12] grimmiee319: havent played since wotlk, is this expan worth it to come back?
[3:27:16] clambynature: Yes!
[3:27:30] indiegarona: @grimmiee319 SL is the best expansion since WotLK, imo
[3:27:33] lotho_: i am enjoying the late stream
[3:28:06] indiegarona: aww
[3:28:14] grimmiee319: literally not once since this one. for some reason this is the first since wrath that actually seems worth a damn
[3:28:21] vanillabeansprout: Hell no... Legion was still the best
[3:28:23] GarbizzlLe: idk man Legion was the new WOTLK imo @Indiegarona
[3:28:24] indiegarona: Wrath was good times though, for us dinosaurs.
[3:28:31] GarbizzlLe: Legion was amazing
[3:28:48] GloriousEggroll: cataclysm was good through firelands, went downhill after. people liked MoP but i disliked it, Draenor was bad, didn't play legion, have heard shadowlands is good but havent experienced much yet
[3:28:51] Boozehound: Legion and MoP are top tier.
[3:29:06] MisterBongwater: I'm feeling it too, these systems they come up are pretty cool for a couple months, but then it's just back to dungeons and raids
[3:29:13] ItsToxicQT: Same @Towelliee
[3:29:24] swordwindgaming: SL story hasn't really gone anywhere, tho. We busted out most of the people in the dungeon and now they're just Oribos hobos.

[3:29:58] grimmiee319: LOL i wanna be mad at that but i get it. props for being real
[3:29:58] ItsToxicQT: @swordwindgaming well get news on 9.1 and possibly 9.2 at blizzconline
[3:30:01] GarbizzlLe: Sylvannas is the new Lich king lol
[3:30:03] GloriousEggroll: @Towelliee and then when you thought it was over they made you grind it every week for centuries until you got all the mounts and the legendary LUL
[3:30:06] Haximaxi: POGGERS
[3:30:14] ShadoodHD: neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerd
[3:30:21] indiegarona: @Towelliee probably LOVED all the Nathanos in BFA... indiNATHANOS
[3:30:25] vanillabeansprout: When I Blizzconline?
[3:30:25] 無職提督: well, tbf, its his expansiion at then end, so yea
[3:30:27] PadidinJones: could you imagine if they made M+ keys for culling of strat?
[3:30:31] ElStaffo: Blasphemy
[3:30:37] TheCliffyShow: I've been enjoying the story.
[3:30:44] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee starting to see how you came to dislike FFXIV story gameplay lol, it all started with Arthas
[3:31:35] GloriousEggroll: it still boggles my mind how every ffxiv expansion has a throw back to like the beginning of the game or things that happened forever ago in the story
[3:32:01] GloriousEggroll: and then out of the blue its like ooooh thats why the dude did that thing that i forgot
[3:32:02] ItsToxicQT: that Kyrian potion is sooo god
[3:32:32] indiegarona: I have a very unpopular loot opinion: Keep loot sparce and hard to get.
[3:32:41] indiegarona: reminds me of Vanilla :)
[3:32:44] Epixil: what changes are they making?
[3:33:10] GarbizzlLe: theyre increasing anima and loot in raids @Epixil
[3:33:10] swordwindgaming: well looting changes are obviously an attempt to retain or bring back players who left post-launch
[3:33:13] Tru1485: but they haven't really
[3:33:17] ebone45: @Indiegarona very unpopular opinion, thats why we have Classic, for Vanilla loot
[3:33:20] indiegarona: lol
[3:33:21] Tru1485: they aren't bringing back WF or TF
[3:33:29] swordwindgaming: theres like 4 times less people in Oribos than there were in first month of SL
[3:33:29] Aidler: Ion just doesn't get it. lost cause
[3:33:31] rilsolo: cuz the sea of cry babies about loot got annoying to them
[3:33:53] indiegarona: Legion loot was kinda ridiculous though
[3:33:57] Lex_Payne: @Towelliee Its tough when there isn't a balance between obtaining loot from pve and pvp
[3:34:01] Hazzarri: how are they changing loot?
[3:34:07] Tru1485: I know but that's what Ion ment when he said let loot be loot
[3:34:10] Anguyen92ab: Well, screw those people. Those people just got to live with it or get out. @rilsolo
[3:34:11] indiegarona: I got my BiS legendary in Legion, from a chest in a random cave.
[3:34:15] Nizoah: i boosted a paladin last week i just hit 200ilvl pvping tonight
[3:34:32] indiegarona: easy loot doesn't feel good. There has to be a balance.
[3:34:37] Tru1485: not howe much dropped
[3:34:40] PlayKn1ght: tbh, there's enough to do in this game that having loot be scarce is not needed in order to keep people playing. if anything it just makes people frustrated and MORE likely to quit
[3:34:45] Lazugo: Im litterally happy if we have the drop rates of BFA i just dont need the extra system (TF,WF,corruption)
[3:34:46] TheCliffyShow: Blizzard: Introducing a revolutionary new system for loot in World of Warcraft...animaforged.
[3:34:52] rilsolo: im just more annoyed with people demanding nerfs to the pvp gearing system instead of them fixing the pve system
[3:34:54] arrowfreak99: The biggest thing is that with out a guild you have no real way to exchange loot drops because so little loot drops. I stopped raiding because its easier to get PvP gear than gear from bosses
[3:35:12] Aidler: but casuals don't pvp. pvp by definition is not casual
[3:35:17] swordwindgaming: The hump is real, tho. Even if you work the vault for ilvl 213-226 loot and get a replacement a week, it'll take months to reach a good ilvl.
[3:35:25] rilsolo: not true, regular bgs is pretty casual
[3:35:31] vanillabeansprout: I hate PvP and feel forced into doing it
[3:35:33] Lexi__Marie: im happy for the people who enjoy pvp but wish it wasnt the best way to gear up
[3:36:12] PadidinJones: @Towelliee is your anima carried over when you switch covenants?
[3:36:21] rilsolo: its always like this though, wait till they put int he nazjatar type zone in 9.1 so they can gear their alts
[3:36:24] vanillabeansprout: No it’s not
[3:36:46] PadidinJones: @sznooz3r yeeech
[3:37:16] Epixil: i bought item for 3500 anima before switching, then after switching sold it back to vendor so had 3500 anima
[3:37:30] jure__: @rilsolo .1 patch is usually just bunch of fixes and boring stuff. Big content usually comes in .2 patch.
[3:37:57] vanillabeansprout: I meant the anima you have reinvested
[3:38:03] rilsolo: well doubt blizz will keep it like this so .1 patch will probably have something
[3:38:11] indiegarona: makes sense though if it is deposited into your current covenant.
[3:38:35] Lexi__Marie: yeah its about to end
[3:38:42] vanillabeansprout: You wouldn’t be able to go back to your other covenant
[3:38:54] TheCliffyShow: You can actually get those items anytime you have the book in your inventory.
[3:38:55] vanillabeansprout: To sell the item once you’ve swapped
[3:39:03] Lexi__Marie: feelsgood
[3:39:04] PadidinJones: You on fiyaaaa
[3:39:08] jure__: i mean, they learnt nothing from legion with the shitty anima items shitting all over our bags again
[3:39:14] CritcobainTV: @Towelliee did you guys get sludge down yet?

[3:55:09] PlayKn1ght: i'm ok with that
[3:55:16] chowzter: balance will be busted
[3:55:17] chowzter: with 2 of em
[3:55:17] ItsToxicQT: yea 3 would be to Strong
[3:55:19] chowzter: :D
[3:55:21] TheCliffyShow: We break that last chain and he'll be like, "Peace! I'm out!"
[3:55:21] cruzeal: bear would be a monster with 3 leggos
[3:55:31] swordwindgaming: leggo #3 is enhanced HoA lol
[3:55:33] Eithos87: the primus being the runecarver would make sense and be awesome
[3:55:40] Aphro_Samurai: i think the 2 leggos should be 1 spec specific and the other class would that break it?
[3:55:52] trivwik: Druid heals would be popppin. Mem of Mother tree. Circle of life and death, and unending growth.. That would be sexy
[3:55:56] r1ftzxd: prot pally l0l
[3:56:02] idenkaz_: runecarver and the primus are not the same person because they have not the same amount of fingers Kappa
[3:56:10] idenkaz_: just saying
[3:56:14] PadidinJones: it kinda looks like him though
[3:56:20] drmabusee: the SL campaign is really good right? I just started to play a week ago and its great for me
[3:56:31] trivwik: @drmabusee It really is. I enjoyed it
[3:56:31] Moobot: Towelliee is now exclusively streaming on Twitch. It has been a long road! Now we begin a new era for Towelliee Gaming. Thank you all for supporting me for the last 10 years. Your loyalty and dedication has made it possible for me to succeed in this space. To new beginnings! towHAMUP towBeer
[3:56:40] TheCliffyShow: The Primus went to go confront the Jailer and disappeared. The Primus was a great crafter and so is the Runecarver. It just makes sense.
[3:56:49] PadidinJones: but why would the primus create the helm of domination and frostmourne?
[3:57:14] indiegarona: I wanna see Anduin go shadow.
[3:57:18] idenkaz_: they have literally different digit numbers of fingers. they cant be the same person.
[3:57:52] indiegarona: See, if you had Door of Shadows right there...
[3:57:58] trivwik: When does season 1 for mythics end?
[3:58:02] TheCliffyShow: Bolvar is still the Lich King...kinda.
[3:58:07] r1ftzxd: the wow story is so convoluted. Nothing makes sense to me anymore.
[3:58:19] TiwazFo5: I think Anduin will be the LK but with the help of Vyrian... he breaks the Jailers hold and uses the power against him
[3:58:33] CDubTheRIPper: what if sylvanas is actually the good guy? LUL
[3:58:36] indiegarona: Varian <3
[3:58:41] PadidinJones: You are NOTHING Bolvar!!
[3:58:43] trivwik: @CDubTheRIPper She is
[3:58:48] Lexi__Marie: the dragons flame sealed his fate
[3:58:48] indiegarona: @CDubTheRIPper she IS the good guy!
[3:58:48] TheCliffyShow: Knights of Ebon Blade still listen to him at least.
[3:59:17] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS idk, im crreamSUS of her
[3:59:23] indiegarona: lol
[3:59:30] trivwik: Sylvannas helped keep the overgrowth to a minimum. That tree was growing out of control. She was just bringing it down a bit. We all do the same to the trees in our front yard.
[3:59:37] idenkaz_: still saying it, the warbringer of Sylvanas will play a big role in the upcoming story of hers.
[3:59:43] TheCliffyShow: You can tell Towelliee has been watching MCU movies lately when he dropping those analogies.
[3:59:45] indiegarona: indiBURNIT
[3:59:48] CDubTheRIPper: @pfylow LUL
[3:59:52] Lexi__Marie: if she turns out to be the one who gets the killing blow on the jailor i will rage
[4:00:10] CDubTheRIPper: nooo NotLikeThis
[4:00:13] idenkaz_: people should go back and watch it in detail.
[4:00:30] rasury123: that is the only way lake you say towellie
[4:00:41] TheCliffyShow: And here I was thinking it was all tied to the Old Gods and Void Lords.
[4:00:52] PadidinJones: @Towelliee I feel like this mount moves so slow
[4:01:07] Aphro_Samurai: so where the hell is Khadgar this entire time?
[4:01:19] pogpanda: what about Tyrande ?
[4:01:27] CDubTheRIPper: i feel like shes just acting like the bad guy but has a good end goal
[4:01:30] Agk90_: every floating mount feels slower
[4:01:36] tonyr23: god
[4:01:36] Anguyen92ab: It's like the shaman's class mount which is an elemental.
[4:01:37] CDubTheRIPper: still crreamSUS
[4:01:38] trivwik: The KSM mount is a mount that is supposed to be seen. The others are supposed to be quick to get you there.
[4:01:42] PadidinJones: Its so big plus you are a Tauren
[4:01:58] TheCliffyShow: @Aphro_Samurai He's having a slumber party with the ghost of Medivh or however you spell it.

[4:02:23] c4mmweir: What time is it there for you towelie
[4:02:24] rasury123: in the end all to chaos went to back all different we espet
[4:02:27] idenkaz_: Khadgar knows whats is coming next so he prepares Kappa
[4:02:38] 0anobis6: if you switch cov. then want to go back do you just be right where you left off in the story and renown?
[4:02:38] TheCliffyShow: @Anguyen92ab I think it's just that big mounts seem slower.
[4:02:45] Aphro_Samurai: @TheCliffyShow LUL what about Alleria? and Velen
[4:03:07] idenkaz_: cant wait to fight the Light Lords Kappa
[4:03:12] indiegarona: Gamon will save us.
[4:03:29] broxh_: ^
[4:03:41] sagethemage40: 40k lmao
[4:03:43] Lexi__Marie: you kidding? just leave gamon chained to that tree
[4:03:44] jawnbone: Favorite Shadowland zone ?? @towelliee
[4:04:27] idenkaz_: yeah not like its already hinted throughout 10 years of storytelling that the light is shady af am i right Kappa

[4:07:28] trivwik: The world will end before wow will. We will be leveling and parsing in the afterlife.
[4:07:38] Wubrew87: Elune tbh is the only interesting lore character to me at this point
[4:07:47] CDubTheRIPper: dcwMhm
[4:07:52] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[4:07:53] indiegarona: lol
[4:07:57] Angelocastro10: there needs to be a darkness counterpart
[4:08:21] idenkaz_: i hold back on theories about Elune because i have a feeling that its a big plot twist.
[4:08:23] CDubTheRIPper: "night" warriors
[4:08:24] Wubrew87: Eclipse Elune and light Elune
[4:08:44] Angelocastro10: hmmm
[4:09:11] ZanderACM: Is the Winter Queen related to Elunbe?
[4:09:21] CDubTheRIPper: danHm
[4:09:26] CDubTheRIPper: danHmm
[4:09:30] idenkaz_: but why would the most powerful being and the first being favor Tyrande? i mean why for what reason. she clearly favors the nightelves for a reason.
[4:09:30] ZanderACM: When the winter queen ressurects Ysera she says she doesnt wanna revive her sisters pet
[4:09:31] Wubrew87: Definitely possible
[4:09:34] Angelocastro10: bitch is bipolar
[4:09:38] ZanderACM: so does that m,ean winter queen is elunes sisters
[4:09:47] UncleJarf: The winter queen literally says she's her sister
[4:09:50] Wheeellz: Ysera is Eonars pet
[4:09:52] Wheeellz: not Elunes
[4:10:13] Neowanderer: yeah there was some qyest thingy sayn yaera was gwe sisters pet
[4:10:31] CDubTheRIPper: who knows, we could visit her in the 3rd part of the xpac
[4:10:36] jure__: WoW: Dark Mode
[4:10:38] idenkaz_: biggest event in WoW? Azeroth waking up
[4:11:01] Neowanderer: oh eonars pet was this in chronical
[4:11:06] CDubTheRIPper: or second even, since we still dont know what happaned to tyrande
[4:11:13] shadowmoonsmile: The Winter Queen calls Ysera her sister's pet, suggesting she could be the sister of Elune or Eonar.
[4:11:27] Neowanderer: who is jailer he is gona exscape and wreck some fools
[4:11:27] storm99413: imo Ysera got taken by elune in legion then it might be so winter queen is related to elune
[4:12:04] GodKingMuninn: BFA was just them buying time.

[4:12:21] Angelocastro10: the sword is there still
[4:12:25] pokerigo: lol
[4:12:25] KingSlayerYotam: LUL LUL
[4:12:27] idenkaz_: blizzard wont touch Azeroth till the end ... thats what i think
[4:12:27] Slapfest: LUL
[4:12:27] indiegarona: Theotar for Lich King
[4:12:33] hapsthehamster: the thing that is missing before azeroth comes alive is for us to see how the true evil is.... Pandas
[4:12:34] iamjo3l: Azeroth gonna wake up, and its all a dream.... and everything gonna roll back to classic
[4:12:45] Neowanderer: yeah what about the giant sword in silithus
[4:13:30] indiegarona: sounds like NJ road repairs
[4:13:33] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee but took them a couple weeks to terraform the park. LUL
[4:13:44] Neowanderer: lol true and now its kings grave site
[4:13:48] idenkaz_: hm. i think its there for a reason. towJesus towHAMUP
[4:14:05] rilsolo: i thought we purified the sword not cauterize the wound
[4:14:07] Angelocastro10: how did we cauterize a wound and the sword stays
[4:14:16] idenkaz_: multi $ Company KEKW
[4:14:17] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee You're wrong. If there was no repaired harbor, you wouldn't have been able to break out the Horde NPCs in BfA
[4:14:29] swordwindgaming: So they repaired Stormwind for the Horde!
[4:14:35] hapsthehamster: thats what gonna happened after shadowlands, all of the leaders of the covenants comes and removes it and puts into the jailor
[4:14:38] Angelocastro10: aint that a forever open wound
[4:15:02] idenkaz_: or its just there for the memes man to remind us of the woooonz
[4:15:10] shadowmoonsmile: Elune is possible given that Elune is a protector of the Emerald Dream and Ysera is foster-mother to her son, Cenarius.
[4:15:13] Neowanderer: whats illidan up to in the pantheon
[4:15:17] MarquisLek: world of warcraft 2
[4:15:39] ZanderACM: i think elune is probably a first one
[4:15:39] Moobot: towHAMUP Follow Towelliee on twitter so you can be in the know at all times! | twitter.com/towelthetank towKawaii
[4:15:45] Angelocastro10: the first one is kungen ofc
[4:15:50] ZanderACM: possibly the creator of ardenweald
[4:16:10] TheCliffyShow: Hogger!
[4:16:12] swordwindgaming: I don't think Actiblizzard cares about developing a replacement for WoW. They'll keep it running like how Ultima Online still exists as a zombie MMO.
[4:16:18] Neowanderer: the jailer pre banishment
[4:16:20] GodKingMuninn: Gamon is a first one
[4:16:29] iBarb: GOTTEM
[4:16:44] idenkaz_: i think the first ones are the protectors of the realms and Elune is something/one who came before and shaped the realms.
[4:16:53] Boozehound: The first ones are the warlords of draenor 2: revenge of the warlords
[4:17:02] TheCliffyShow: Pyromancer?
[4:17:02] Wubrew87: Thats def the old jailer
[4:17:08] CDubTheRIPper: the death of wow is when itll go f2p, like 20 years from now lol
[4:17:13] swordwindgaming: @Towelliee he was streaming the FFXIV keynote, came back for that #ad money
[4:17:18] Angelocastro10: jailer before meth
[4:17:18] Neowanderer: plausible
[4:17:21] clichejmart: thats deep
[4:17:23] ZanderACM: i dont thik so
[4:17:24] KingSlayerYotam: 200iq
[4:17:29] Wubrew87: Wow will never be F2P...look at Everquest...there is no poinmt for WoW to ever go F2P
[4:17:30] indiegarona: I think the hole in his chest is going to be very important
[4:17:31] ZanderACM: they refer to the jailer as their brother
[4:17:41] ZanderACM: so that means all of the leaders of the covenants would be first ones
[4:17:48] idenkaz_: Arbiter orb
[4:17:49] CDubTheRIPper: arbiter
[4:17:52] indiegarona: The Arbiter
[4:17:54] Neowanderer: pryo lol tcant believe he trashed his relationship with blizz super dumb
[4:18:06] indiegarona: lol
[4:18:12] TheCliffyShow: The hole in his chest is like when people get holes in their throat from smoking.
[4:18:17] Angelocastro10: the hole is for something kinky for sure
[4:18:17] BlackAngelxD: BlackAngelxD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[4:18:23] idenkaz_: ngl but the lore is the best part of SL for me ..
[4:18:27] ZanderACM: All of the other leaders of the covenants refer to the jailer as their brother
[4:18:29] storm99413: but then wouldn't all of the convenant leader be the first one also since they call the jailer brother ?
[4:18:32] ZanderACM: so if hes a banisghed first one
[4:18:34] hapsthehamster: the merging of the arbiter and the jailor making them into the mecha judge
[4:18:37] ZanderACM: then all of them are a first one
[4:18:56] Neowanderer: so what is sire denarius up to now?
[4:19:16] storm99413: sun bathing
[4:19:21] Neowanderer: she better not get redeemed gag
[4:19:43] Angelocastro10: i think sylvannas has stockholm syndrome
[4:19:44] TheCliffyShow: Shit gets confusing when you start doing cosmic stuff.
[4:19:57] idenkaz_: magemyway gifted a Tier 1 sub to storm99413! They have given 5 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:20:10] CDubTheRIPper: we should tortue denathrius to give us the answers Kappa
[4:20:20] Neowanderer: oh yeah totally he is using her and bamboozled
[4:20:29] CDubTheRIPper: for sure
[4:20:49] Angelocastro10: i think the jailer might kill her
[4:20:50] ZanderACM: her alliance with the jailer makes no sense
[4:20:53] CDubTheRIPper: didnt that happen to a character in the storyline? once they were used they were gotten rid of
[4:20:54] ZanderACM: she hates arthas

[4:21:04] ZanderACM: and he created arthas, so why would she ally herself with him
[4:21:08] ZanderACM: doesnt make any sense
[4:21:22] TheCliffyShow: Sylvanas isn't bad she's just polygoned that way.
[4:21:38] Neowanderer: he has to come back to finish the uther story
[4:21:39] GodKingMuninn: @Towelliee I want garrosh to show up and bitch slap sylvannas.
[4:21:39] Moobot: towGreen Shadowlands Limited Edition TOWELLIEE covenant shirts AND Towelliee hats are LIVE! check them out HERE! | Dbh.la/towelliee towBlue
[4:21:40] idenkaz_: like i said people should really watch her warbringer and how she died and what she last saw before she became a Banshee. Blizzard said the warbringers are canon
[4:21:44] swordwindgaming: The storyline is just dumb in general. Sylvanas probably is stuck on not killing Arthas herself, so she wants another shot for closure.
[4:21:49] Meshindale: that song timing just as you spoke about arthas
[4:21:50] Angelocastro10: look the music
[4:21:51] MikeyGy: well Maiev and Illidan joined to fighht legion
[4:22:03] swordwindgaming: Arthas coming back is why anyone cares about the Maw, though.
[4:22:03] indiegarona: @Angelocastro10 appropriate music lol
[4:22:04] Hjolt: They arleady shown him, its a matter of when, not if. And it's probably soon.
[4:22:39] CDubTheRIPper: pretty sure sylvanas has a plan. theres no way shes dumb enough to get played by the jailer after all that shes done
[4:22:49] idenkaz_: the bastion cinematic takes place eons before we arrive
[4:22:54] Hjolt: They revealed his location, too. Which is the maw. and we are there. Too convinient for them to pass up on that
[4:22:55] Neowanderer: with uther back we may bet arthas but not loch kliing maybe he gets a redemtption
[4:23:06] GodKingMuninn: Arthas himself wasn't bad though.
[4:23:11] pahanzt: maybe Arthas will shed some light on Jailer's origin and stuff.
[4:23:15] Hjolt: Imagine leaving Arthas hanging in the maw and end expac without showing him tho. That'd be a bummer LUL
[4:23:20] storm99413: well garrosh almost there
[4:23:32] Strik3r019: the jailer needs all 9 sacred weapons to finish project tsuki no me and destory everything
[4:23:34] Borango: And then everyone were actually there LUL
[4:23:46] WaylanderNL: WaylanderNL subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months! 
[4:23:57] Neowanderer: cant forget about helya too
[4:24:04] GodKingMuninn: We've known about the shadowlands for like 10 years though through random lorebooks in WoW so coulda just missed it
[4:24:06] idenkaz_: yeah Helya tho
[4:24:12] CDubTheRIPper: hes noble enough to make the sacrifice
[4:24:20] CDubTheRIPper: or is it not a choice
[4:24:40] Wubrew87: After Varian i really hope Anduin doesnt become LK Sadge
[4:24:45] HiggiTV: HiggiTV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 57 months! 
[4:24:45] Neowanderer: anduin and slyvannas have a weird relationship
[4:24:49] Hjolt: It seems every "light" character must be broken at some point in WoW's lore.
[4:24:52] jure__: totes unfortch
[4:24:53] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[4:25:03] HiggiTV: towW
[4:25:04] GodKingMuninn: Velen is a pussy get him out of here.
[4:25:09] TiwazFo5: Anduin and Sylvanas just need to bang... like hard... then we can move on to killing the Jailer
[4:25:25] Kasbit_: Will a Anduin be a raid boss then?
[4:25:26] ZanderACM: I think it would be kinda cool for Arthas's arc to be similar to Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. Have him be the big bad guy for so long but to get redemption, start off good
[4:25:26] Creative_Pigeon: why the swap @Towelliee
[4:25:27] swordwindgaming: Anduin can't go bad without a proper replacement. Hes the only real Alliance leader who doesn't want to destroy Orgrimmar.
[4:25:32] ZanderACM: I think that would be cool
[4:25:53] Hjolt: Anduin reminds Sylvanas of Wrynn too much i suppose. She has the mom's instinct towards the guy.

[4:29:15] CockneyRat: defending is easy as shit
[4:29:15] CDubTheRIPper: out of like 10
[4:29:16] Ezekyler: attacking is a waste of time
[4:29:22] swordwindgaming: attacking is terrible
[4:29:33] swordwindgaming: your defense has to be almost completely awful and lazy for attackers to win

[4:57:37] jure__: see, if they implemented the PVP gearing system to PVE as well, everything would be fine
[4:57:54] Creative_Pigeon: my biggest thing was the insomnia
[4:58:22] TheUnknowing: My mom smoked for probably about 30 years before quitting cold turkey 5 or so years ago @Khalio23 in for a rough ride but you got it
[4:58:22] TheCliffyShow: @Towelliee You quit vaping? Good for you!
[4:58:24] swordwindgaming: I don't even feel like my legendary does all that much. I only really have it to boost my IO score.
[4:58:26] Noshpan: @Khalio23 I wish you the best of luck & cheer you on
[4:58:42] Slitze: sup dude
[4:58:47] indiegarona: @Khalio23 there are great apps to help keep you motivated, too. It's worth a try! You'll save a ton of money and gain health benefits every day you don't smoke.
[4:58:50] wilZifer: wow that's crazy
[4:58:51] Fioray: Quit smoking 4 years ago, after smoking like 15 years. It was pure hell at the start. Least to me.
[4:58:55] Slitze: u quit vaping wtf did i miss?
[4:58:57] jure__: I heard sauna helps a lot when you stop smoking
[4:58:57] Sadisticmedic: I like a Waffle with Nuttella

[4:59:10] wilZifer: didn't know the effects were that crazy
[4:59:20] Slitze: Paradox on the Rox
[4:59:22] Slitze: good shit
[4:59:27] PlayKn1ght: get urself some chantix
[4:59:27] indiegarona: It depends on how long and heavy the smoker who is quitting
[4:59:30] PadidinJones: Isnt there a achiv for winning while controlling everything?
[4:59:39] indiegarona: I went cold turkey over 15 years ago.
[4:59:43] Khalio23: They say nicotine addiction is harder to quit than hard drugs etc and alchohol, or can be atleast
[5:00:03] Noshpan: Gotta be careful with Chantix. It made my youngest brother start to hear voices that weren't there.
[5:00:22] PadidinJones: omg this is nutz
[5:00:32] Noshpan: @Khalio23 My mother said hte same thing. It was easier for her to quit crank than it is to quit nicotine.
[5:00:33] Khalio23: @Indiegarona Whats that app called again?
[5:00:42] wisperuna: @Towelliee came back just in time to view somethjing intersting

[5:02:36] wisperuna: @Towelliee well they be able to carry
[5:02:41] indiegarona: Meatball is a boss.
[5:02:42] Deathdealer1837: @Towelliee wait you swapped conv? what made you do that?
[5:03:07] TheCliffyShow: Maybe because they are neutral companions all covenants get.
[5:03:18] indiegarona: Yeah
[5:03:24] Colt_Engineer: @Towelliee why didn't the undead cross the road? because he didn't have the guts
[5:03:28] indiegarona: It'd make no sense to lose all the non-specific companions
[5:03:34] Slitze: sounds like the targhast ones stay with u
[5:03:36] Kebabra_: Why the switch to Kyrian? Thought Ashen Hollow was the best
[5:03:39] Colt_Engineer: lol

[5:03:55] Slitze: that's cool
[5:04:25] Haximaxi: if you go to torghast now @Towelliee there is a bunch of Kyrian waiting for you at the entrance
[5:04:33] Slitze: just seems like cosmetic and what not though so doesn't seem bad
[5:04:34] Haximaxi: i just switched too
[5:04:44] wisperuna: @Towelliee if you swap after you did the campaign you start from lvl 1 renown and build up 2 levels a week or ?
[5:05:01] Haximaxi: strange there was for me
[5:05:04] ninousT: nah
