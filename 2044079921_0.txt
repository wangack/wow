[0:26:42] face2face: On fortified it should be fine
[0:27:00] face2face: 2nd boss is the hardest tank moment on EB so I feel like it should be fine on fort

[0:44:23] theBroHam: morning yall. how go the keys today
[0:44:46] Nonyamuff: This makes me wanna m+ this weekend
[0:44:47] dragona92: I really think they overdid Yazma with the wracking pain thing
[0:45:03] dragona92: They shoulda cut the timer or buff other bosses rather than do what they did
[0:45:18] theBroHam: not being interruptable is the worst decision they could have made to make this dungeon harder
[0:45:28] dragona92: Agreed
[0:45:53] dragona92: Feels like they concentrated too much of the hard part in the last boss and that makes this key so much more frustrating to deplete compared to others
[0:48:01] Qabhal: 16m sanguine eoverall ?
[0:48:09] Qabhal: nays
[0:49:14] dragona92: We shut down the Sanguine stream for this key KEKW
[0:49:17] instabrickkeyassassin: sanguine fell off like my boy kyrian weapons sadge

[1:14:02] Whitewolf1441: seems like an oversight
[1:14:10] silentkillervgc: sanguine is amazing affix /s
[1:14:27] bartfux: hear me out... just cc/dps harder KEKW
[1:14:33] asphyxiiaTV: sanguine's a pretty new affix?
[1:14:46] theBroHam: half of blizzards design team is like - purple floor = purple swirlies. Red floor...red swirlies.
[1:14:49] morbid98: morbid98 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:14:53] bartfux: @asphyxiiaTV no. its old AF lol
[1:14:58] bartfux: he's being sarcastic
[1:15:03] finalchallenge94: @asphyxiiaTV its a joke
[1:15:10] asphyxiiaTV: OOF didn't catch that im so very sorry jdotbabes
[1:15:16] Whitewolf1441: jb, do you think making the cast interruptable would fix afflicted?
[1:15:24] asphyxiiaTV: working and watching streams fucks my head up a lil bit

[1:20:12] Guffels: is this for io? feels like its going too well
[1:20:48] ridder30: so i guess tettles is just going to ignore the fact the the top two dps on the leaderboards are moonkins
[1:21:22] Guffels: doesnt make them better than aug. sometimes you have to play what the comp needs
[1:21:45] bartfux: moonkin burst is so satisfying.
[1:21:59] Sizebot: I think they fixed it
[1:22:00] bartfux: when you line up like 9 starsurges in row.
[1:22:05] bartfux: gachiBASS
[1:22:09] face2face: Boomie sandbagging is one of the strongest forces in the known universe @ridder30
[1:22:16] AlphasaurusRexx: @jdotb do you use an mmo mouse?
[1:22:27] face2face: Second only to boomie whining when they're actually mid (they're never bad, at worst they're mid)
[1:23:03] bartfux: true. haha. thats why druid has always been the strongest in the game. there is always ONE spec that top, and the rest are, at worst, mid.
[1:23:17] bartfux: and they do everything, you just have to gear for it.
[1:24:52] LCSpartan: its fun when you die to the first volley then proceed to not get the buff the entire fight
[1:25:13] theBroHam: @AlphasaurusRexx he does not
[1:26:34] Gaemer: yoo gratz
[1:26:39] naturesremedy: What is the add on that puts the defensives next to the frames?
[1:26:52] tr1plus: omnicd probably
[1:27:29] naturesremedy: lol
[1:27:32] naturesremedy: Tettles
[1:27:35] naturesremedy: the shit stirrer
[1:27:36] LCSpartan: wait whats tettles doing xD
[1:27:44] snowarden: catch these hands :D
[1:27:53] Buffiin: what he say?
[1:27:57] ridder30: just link him a screenshot of the dps leaderboard as a responce
[1:29:15] LCSpartan: its hard for me to do work when theres beef

[1:30:06] LCSpartan: also is it wrong to be eating leftover wings for breakfast?
[1:30:21] mattyp13: He calling Tettles up rn?
[1:30:26] epik__tv: @LCSpartan never
[1:30:36] LCSpartan: thats a whole different level of trash talk xD
[1:30:56] LCSpartan: @NotEpik_TV i got some leftover mango habenaro wings and its about to be everyone elses problem
[1:31:21] naturesremedy: We cant hear u Jdot
[1:31:23] naturesremedy: :)
[1:31:23] snowarden: you are muted'
[1:31:34] naturesremedy: Throne
[1:31:35] IoDaBR: Unmute yourself, old man :)
[1:31:36] naturesremedy: Ouchie
[1:31:48] naturesremedy: Only thing in there that sucks is them darn dogs
[1:31:58] naturesremedy: Oh and the debuff
[1:32:02] s_dawg1: Lol
[1:32:02] naturesremedy: from the sents
[1:32:17] elliss112: how are u jb
[1:32:25] morbid98: are these the same boomkins, which compete with other DPS in 29-30s?
[1:32:49] snowarden: dont drop
[1:32:59] theBroHam: tell them suck it up and try the 30
[1:33:17] LCSpartan: is he talking m+ or raid? for boomie or is it just like in general?
[1:33:17] IoDaBR: you can do the 30, Jb. RDruid owns!
[1:34:23] Fevxd: Sound logic that
[1:34:30] dragona92: That's not true tho, druid has always been popular even when it's bad, especially balance
[1:34:39] ridder30: jb will never vouch for shaman buffs
[1:34:42] DyneTV: You need mark of the wild
[1:34:54] LCSpartan: @dragona92 thats because its easier than some other casters and less intrusive
[1:35:00] dragona92: @LCSpartan Agreed
[1:35:11] DyneTV: go to damage 95% percentile
[1:35:13] morbid98: i think Dorki is pumping on his chicken in keys, no?
[1:35:21] naturesremedy: The only change I can see boomkin may need
[1:35:24] Lrauq: it makes sense to combine parses by class too
[1:35:27] naturesremedy: is the 3 debuff deal
[1:35:29] snowarden: there alway a  resto druid in a raid too tho so dont need boomi
[1:35:31] naturesremedy: to do damage
[1:35:31] theBroHam: There's no problem with moonkin in keys
[1:36:10] Lrauq: classic laser turkeys
[1:36:14] theBroHam: only 2 groups not boomie
[1:36:20] morbid98: boom boom boom boom
[1:36:24] morbid98: KEKW
[1:36:25] dragona92: @snowarden not true tho
[1:36:32] dithrica: boomkin lost all meaing
[1:36:36] dithrica: meaning*
[1:36:43] swolefitzy: it's meme no
[1:36:55] healapotamus: fat chicken needs more juice
[1:36:58] theBroHam: ooo trying tree?
[1:37:01] naturesremedy: Boomkins are ALWAYS asking for Boomkin buffs.
[1:37:01] Guffels: i think the bigger problem is that is his their groups boomkin and aug and you need the aug to support the boomkin
[1:37:03] Snizzlenose: ah but you see, aug and mage is more popular Kapp
[1:37:07] MrDadDude: Tree PAL spec
[1:37:18] elliss112: jb do u know how i make a trigger in weakaura that only trigger, if i for example in raid group 2?
[1:37:32] ScapeeJ: US wow just shut down?
[1:37:36] justbeachi: the 3 pack at the end is so hard to heal
[1:37:39] naturesremedy: Yes US is down
[1:37:40] justbeachi: on fort
[1:37:43] ScapeeJ: wtf
[1:37:44] naturesremedy: they are doing maint
[1:38:00] snowarden: remember mass root
[1:38:05] Greneer: they layed off the servers on the way out
[1:38:29] ScapeeJ: Thats why that Lock kept saying we dont have time lolol I was like wtf
[1:38:37] Guffels: i couldnt imagine being middle of the road spec and still asking for buffs
[1:39:06] LCSpartan: @Guffels imagine being a warrior lol
[1:39:10] Guffels: i mean i could but it would be disingenuous af
[1:39:11] treavorthenusance: yea i finished an key on my mage with 1 min left on the server. what a rush
[1:39:26] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:39:31] theBroHam: talk about beating the timer lol
[1:39:44] treavorthenusance: the ultimate timer lol
[1:40:24] treavorthenusance: tree is good its just hard to figure out exactly when you need as 90% of the time it just causes overhealing in m+
[1:40:26] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[1:40:36] treavorthenusance: for bursting in lower keys its goes hard though
[1:41:15] P4weZ: flask ~
[1:41:44] Guffels: Also wtf is he saying that just because boomkin isnt top 3 ranged specs it needs buffs??
[1:42:05] Fevxd: @Guffels Its dogshit in raid bud
[1:42:09] Fevxd: Its good in keys, yes.
[1:42:19] theBroHam: exactly. Bad in raid, good in keys
[1:42:25] justbeachi: needs a bit of a rework. it's only good in high keys, the ramp is just awkward
[1:42:31] Sizebot: Ele shaman is equally bad in raid and also not even half as good in m+ SeemsGood
[1:42:42] mattyp13: Would love to see some separate M+ and raid tuning, like in PvP
[1:42:50] mattyp13: For specs
[1:42:55] Guffels: does anyone need dps in raid?? pretty sure any spec in the game can kill all the mythic bosses with current gear
[1:43:01] theBroHam: oh boy
[1:43:04] justbeachi: missing the 1st volley is crazy
[1:43:11] EriktheRed27: doesn't boomkin basically require aug in high keys though?
[1:43:13] dragona92: Correction tho - moonkin is only good in high keys... They're usually useless in tyrannical or low keys cuz everything gets obliterated before they can get shit going
[1:43:14] carir1000: What is the thing rsham is missing for keys
[1:43:14] TisbaT: Dots deal double damage if it affected only one taget ?
[1:43:15] tr1plus: wait, Did the last 2 hours of work not pass?
[1:43:16] LCSpartan: @justbeachi thats really the issue is the difference between the mid level keys and the high level keys is nuts
[1:43:17] nisou033: Can't they apply buffs and say " Does not apply for m+ " ? like they do for PvP & raids ?
[1:43:21] treavorthenusance: corroding what? *presses more dmg button*
[1:43:33] ridder30: @carir1000 a group buff of some sort
[1:43:37] Shkafche: what , tree form ?!?! we swapping ?
[1:43:38] monochromator: Its weird because they already do some meta balancing between m+ and raid but they won't commit
[1:43:46] carir1000: man i hate group buffs lol
[1:44:00] frazlord: @nisou033 they've done stuff for healers like increasing the healing of revival if there are <= 5 people
[1:44:02] treavorthenusance: rise's timer is soooo tight
[1:44:09] justbeachi: @carir1000 I think rsham is missing passive damage and external DRs. but the recent buffs make them ok.
[1:44:11] Shkafche: ohh exciting, might be good for surviving stuff (also BRH bolts :D )
[1:44:30] theBroHam: @nisou033 not really. They need to do rework on boomie single target/ramp v. AOE strafall admage
[1:44:39] theBroHam: god I can't type today
[1:45:01] P4weZ: asking buffs for raid then not even raid mythic kinda yikes if i remeber correct
[1:45:08] Guffels: @carir1000 nothing it can time 29's its just not the best this patch. nothing is the best every patch
[1:45:21] LCSpartan: yeah idk part of it is just boomies damage profile from 2 target and up is really really linear
[1:46:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[1:46:51] LCSpartan: so its good at M+  but then suffers cause ST kinda blows
[1:47:17] theBroHam: that's the gist of it
[1:47:37] dragona92: @LCSpartan And it used to be the opposite back in BFA KEKW Like moonkins were good in ST back then but u didn't use starfall until there's 8 targets or smth KEKW

[1:51:32] LCSpartan: @theBroHam that and in raid you get in weird gameplay loops like you starfall with 2 or more targets but are going solar eclipse and starfire feel like trash to hit.
[1:51:53] Whitewolf1441: chat, anyone know when servers are gonna be up?
[1:52:14] LCSpartan: no idea but servers down on a friday seems like some sorta emergency maintenance
[1:52:23] treavorthenusance: probably like 1030 or 1045 ish typically
[1:52:25] Guffels: 45  minute if you trust blizzard
[1:52:32] Whitewolf1441: should i trust blizzard?
[1:52:47] treavorthenusance: i mean on non patch resets yeah typically
[1:52:52] monochromator: Aren't timed phases great
[1:53:29] bonjourdaisy: treee form snooze
[1:53:53] MightyGIGACHAD: that feeling when you’re new to rdruid and you realize thrash is an ability you have as resto, and it’s not on your bar at all after just seeing you use it KEKW  Time for more overall dmg Yep
[1:53:56] treavorthenusance: if all 5 players synced melds would the incorp insta drop?
[1:54:28] LCSpartan: yeah but you would evade everything
[1:54:48] bonjourdaisy: TRANQ??
[1:55:12] treavorthenusance: running this gauntlet at 100ms would make me wanna cry lol

[2:05:59] FrostmagicED: the fuck is this 1 minute shadowfiend shit
[2:06:01] FrostmagicED: gross
[2:06:13] Guffels: yeah hope you have 45% haste ready
[2:06:53] FrostmagicED: @Guffels is 45% the breakpoint fo rit
[2:06:59] FrostmagicED: im sitting 42 atm
[2:07:07] dsune_: do you think resto druid suck in raid?
[2:07:33] FrostmagicED: @dsune_ the top parse for Fyrakk is using timewalking uldar trinket for a reason
[2:07:51] t4pekid: xdd
[2:08:17] Guffels: its the 30% dr breakpoint. i like having more but the top log only runs 6300. second runs 7200 though
[2:08:32] FrostmagicED: oh
[2:08:42] Guffels: most people run 7000+
[2:08:47] FrostmagicED: I'm at 8k 44 when I swap to m non avoidance/sprit boots
[2:08:50] treavorthenusance: resto druid in raid should be considered inhumane punishment to play lol
[2:09:01] weldary: On low keys: what is this dmg ? I need to move out I guess. On high keys: I got 0.5 sec to jump out.
[2:09:02] Guffels: is that before or after dr?
[2:09:11] FrostmagicED: oh true is 7500
[2:09:13] FrostmagicED: 7522

[2:09:26] Guffels: yeah thats fine. even a little high compared to top logs
[2:09:33] treavorthenusance: jdot becoming tree pilled
[2:09:35] FrostmagicED: little high means i can swap my weapon back
[2:10:03] P4weZ: @FrostmagicED is there possible see how much that saved mana?
[2:10:04] FrostmagicED: I literally went from a guild perma extending 19 man roster progging COUNCIL to reclearing mythic in a trial with a guild I didn't like and then now I'm on the dragon
[2:10:26] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb

[2:11:05] FrostmagicED: jdots answer "pass the trial"
[2:11:10] treavorthenusance: the ol' tranq and spank
[2:11:48] treavorthenusance: just insta deleted
[2:11:52] monochromator: Zmok?
[2:12:09] monochromator: No release strats
[2:12:45] Guffels: tbh tree looked kinda chill and with no aug
[2:12:54] ridder30: zmok, the creator of no healer runs, and jb in the same key
[2:13:22] theBroHam: it was going so well
[2:13:27] Dunao: dont yell get better
[2:13:36] monochromator: High keys sure seem like fun
[2:13:54] caradea_: nah if your ret would've lived it would be over 30 sec earlier
[2:14:01] Guffels: you were almost 350k hps. thats wild difference
[2:14:04] theBroHam: got a point
[2:14:13] caradea_: but tree looks very good in there, i agree
[2:14:17] treavorthenusance: yea tree gives a butt ton of throughput
[2:15:10] lofibanshee: lofibanshee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! This is for putting boomies in their place on twitter.
[2:16:22] BipolarPongal: banger tweets as always, mate. Love it :)
[2:16:23] JMaC727: POGGERS
[2:16:59] treavorthenusance: my problem with tree is i get fast and loose with the insta regrowths and eat a bit too much mana
[2:17:20] theBroHam: yeah same
[2:17:37] theBroHam: forget they're not free in tree
[2:18:15] FrostmagicED: FrostmagicED watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! yo wtf
[2:18:24] FrostmagicED: my smite cast is so fast
[2:18:28] FrostmagicED: I dont finisht he nelf animation
[2:18:39] FrostmagicED: KEKW
[2:18:39] Guffels: yep
[2:18:58] FrostmagicED: I normally play 38-36%
[2:18:59] Guffels: under pi and lust you can get the cast time under the gcd
[2:19:00] FrostmagicED: this is crazy
[2:19:02] treavorthenusance: @FrostmagicED we're reaching levels of smite that we didn't know were possible
[2:19:27] jhand1es: now if he rants about evok and healerless keys i win jdotbingo
[2:19:30] lofibanshee: Can't believe tettles tried to use my graphs for his case >_<
[2:20:05] Guffels: that graph doesnt even make boomkin look down bad lol
[2:20:15] Emm_Zee: Yeah but it's not played in +15s so it sucks Kappa
[2:20:16] treavorthenusance: yea boomkins dont need a buff. fire mages though need another 20% on pyroblast Kappa
[2:20:19] zebracak35: peopel are eviscerating mike ybarra on twitter today jesus
[2:20:23] lofibanshee: Yeah even in the graph boomie is 6th highest dps lmao
[2:20:27] JMaC727: what's the tweet?  when i go to twitter it only shows 2022 tweets
[2:20:33] ren0m: Are we required to hate on boomies to be a jdotbabe?
[2:20:38] lofibanshee: Like woe is me, we're not #1.
[2:20:39] ren0m: I thought it was evokers
[2:20:52] treavorthenusance: yes because boomkins dont use bearform. until they do they remain on the list
[2:20:55] zebracak35: @ren0m Only when they say they are the worst least brought cspec in teh game. So like allt he time but yeah
[2:21:08] Guffels: 6 of 39 is insanely meta
[2:21:37] pl0de: @JMaC727 think you need to be logged in to an account to see the recent tweets
[2:21:40] ren0m: Wasn't that just one of the weekly "here's a graph that shows why *my class* is bad and needs buffs"
[2:21:47] athemick: Anyone know what can cause Stonecrack DoT applied to party, when everyone in party was in soak, but we sstill sometimes get DoT from it? Does it happen if someone immunes or not take dmg from barrage at all?
[2:22:05] lofibanshee: In his defense, 6 of those runs are the same boomie lol.
[2:22:27] MakoTheGako: my guild might stop raiding, is Wow-progress still the best website to look for guild?
[2:22:27] ScapeeJ: Suck ur Mudda
[2:22:34] FrostmagicED: @lofibanshee hey the amount of work you put into those graphs is wild.
[2:22:47] Guffels: @MakoTheGako raiderio recruitment works
[2:22:51] FrostmagicED: @MakoTheGako I put a recruitment page out there for RIO and WCL
[2:23:13] FrostmagicED: and asked everyone that reached out to me where they came from and it was equal split
[2:23:33] monochromator: Everbloom be busy
[2:23:40] fallb4me: what does it offer that havoc doesnt
[2:23:43] LCSpartan: @monochromator everyone wants that damn trinket
[2:23:48] ren0m: How do Chinese teams do in MDI? They seem to have the highest M+ score out of all regions
[2:23:49] MakoTheGako: @Guffels alright will give it a go ty
[2:24:00] lofibanshee: Andy squad don't give a fuck tho, per usual.
[2:24:16] terrorhans_: did you play all m+ keys with this tree ?
[2:24:22] zamow1994: it is so dumb that some classes get that insane uncapped aoe
[2:24:24] Guffels: kek no
[2:24:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[2:24:30] zamow1994: i never understood that balance
[2:24:45] FrostmagicED: @zamow1994 the balance is the class dies if anything looks at it funny
[2:24:52] P4weZ: i feel feral and boomi aoe is same spot atm might be wrong KEKW
[2:24:58] LCSpartan: @FrostmagicED kek
[2:25:15] dragona92: WHOLETHIMCOOK
[2:25:25] Guffels: isnt reforestation 1 min if you delay
[2:25:29] zamow1994: tranq HUH
[2:25:34] Emm_Zee: @zamow1994 Ngl I think "uncapped aoe" is overrated, like sure it's a strength but outlaw is also super strong and it's capped
[2:25:35] caradea_: you can cover the first two with tree, flourish 3rd, use swiftmend tree for 4th and go again
[2:25:39] RemwayTV: I find third boss is key with reforestation management
[2:25:40] BipolarPongal: Tree form should last first 2
[2:25:51] terrorhans_: interesting thx :) maybe i try this
[2:25:58] caradea_: should be 20 seconds between each set
[2:26:15] zamow1994: @Emm_Zee yea, i guess the bigger problem is some classes need to specc aoe and some just get it
[2:26:22] Guffels: can you show healing from Cen ward last key?
[2:26:26] Emm_Zee: @Emm_Zee Aware ret paladins
[2:27:02] LCSpartan: @Emm_Zee The difference is does uncapped need setup, like boomie for example to dot everything, vs Does it  just insta do it
[2:27:03] ren0m: How valuable are WF totems?
[2:27:05] ren0m: for melee
[2:27:16] lofibanshee: simp the rogue comp
[2:27:17] Guffels: are we sure that isnt the drop over switftness i know its cringe
[2:27:25] FrostmagicED: Idk how relevant it is but dicksum (dxm) doesn't play tranq so that he can still load the instant regrowth and harmionous bloom. but he's also much more comfy on tree
[2:27:44] FrostmagicED: cen ward is extremely good b/c it gives an extra stack of mastery on a target tat needs it
[2:28:36] lofibanshee: It's over for Tettles, Reloe just got em.
[2:28:44] chelseasmile78: despell

[2:29:28] mr__pear: What does NS do for convoke?
[2:29:40] bareuheldig: Fuck boomkins
[2:29:45] aimbim: boomkins spreading misinformation as per usual
[2:29:52] lofibanshee: LUL true
[2:30:01] zamow1994: boomkins gaslighting Madge
[2:30:02] zebracak35: ever since boomkins were whining that no one would bring them to sanctum and then there were 4 in every raid i just refuse to listen to them bitch
[2:30:12] Shadostealer: true and real
[2:30:13] Jonathiaun: There was a non-insignificant amount of time that I thought Tettles was an unspoken-of member of the Trump family, similar to Tiffany.
[2:30:14] JMaC727: can someone link the tweet
[2:30:17] gofortrekon: how come you are playing tree form chief?
[2:30:36] chelseasmile78: no poison despell? :P
[2:30:36] BipolarPongal: Especially after spending 450 pulls on Tindral, fuck boomkins for sure
[2:30:54] gofortrekon: understanable
[2:31:00] Guffels: lol
[2:31:08] dragona92: Ooooof
[2:31:11] chelseasmile78: haha true :)
[2:31:16] dragona92: He cooked KEKW
[2:32:54] pl0de: Surely someone took dispell Clueless
[2:32:59] chelseasmile78: hahaha xDD
[2:33:18] dragona92: Aware
[2:33:22] Guffels: every poison just to punish him kek
[2:33:33] lofibanshee: testing theory
[2:33:38] lofibanshee: doesn't look it
[2:33:40] lofibanshee: lol
[2:33:51] monochromator: No, dispels are a healer mechanic including ones you cant dispel. Just dispel it
[2:35:02] pl0de: he was just letting you sweat a little I guess
[2:38:09] DONGAMAN: tranq in current year monkaHmm
[2:38:24] Muddymonk: Why is he pulling them to narnia? hidden tech?
[2:38:29] Lumimyrsky: LUL what is even happening with this pull though.
[2:38:36] monochromator: Hidden butt pull Gnarlroot tech
[2:38:37] vlorg2: cause he's running for his life
[2:38:54] FrostmagicED: why are we not wiping on this pull is it not just
[2:38:55] FrostmagicED: giga faster
[2:39:07] Nico_vdM: Easier to kill Gnarlroot in this dungeon than in raid :p
[2:39:09] lofibanshee: My dude full taking a nice bath in that sanguine.
[2:39:15] barrizzle: there can be only one Tree
[2:39:23] monochromator: I dunno this gnarlroot might have more health
[2:39:31] lofibanshee: You gotta let Gnarlroot live for raid smh
[2:40:00] BradIey: dont talk to him like that
[2:40:16] CyonDru: Dw guys it’s the alternate universe gnarlroot. not the one we know
[2:40:19] monochromator: Extra secret fifth everbloom boss
[2:40:19] lofibanshee: You think they gave us this dungeon specifically because Gnarlroot was in here and in raid?
[2:40:26] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[2:40:39] CyonDru: this is not the gnarlroot we know
[2:40:52] JMaC727: idiot
[2:40:57] dragona92: KEKW
[2:41:01] davaIon: strong.. flexing on npcs
[2:41:17] dragona92: Technically he's Writhebark, Gnarlroot is in the raid but yeah KEKW
[2:42:23] davaIon: yea the mini boss literally named Gnarlroot
[2:42:37] monochromator: This tank has that extra secret tech
[2:42:44] dragona92: Ooh NOTED
[2:42:45] lofibanshee: This is the sanguine the boss strat
[2:43:03] lofibanshee: okay boss wasn't pulled D:
[2:43:06] dragona92: I always used to call the boss Gnarlroot even tho I know it's not him KEKW

[2:55:02] theBroHam: i hate this boss so much
[2:56:04] vlorg2: her frostbolt cant be kicked
[2:56:15] caradea_: sure it can
[2:56:20] caradea_: arcane cant
[2:56:34] vlorg2: the trash yes, the boss no
[2:56:37] bomhuuus: nothing can be kicked onthat boss? no?
[2:56:49] caradea_: really? mb then
[2:56:54] bonjourdaisy: NOPE
[2:57:07] vlorg2: and her bolt hit like a TRUCK
[2:58:31] pl0de: I hate this boss man
[2:58:33] theBroHam: time?
[2:58:46] pl0de: in pugs it's just suffering
[2:58:57] theBroHam: well rip there it goes
[2:59:06] Sokchoy: is this key capped
[2:59:26] flawlesslykun: was allready depleted before u pulled tho
[2:59:30] flawlesslykun: the 2nd time i mean
[3:00:28] flawlesslykun: KEKW
[3:00:33] flawlesslykun: just heal jb 4Head
[3:05:52] Mafre1: How did the raid go last night
[3:06:27] frazlord: Who's beefing on twitter?
[3:08:05] theBroHam: "dialogue"
[3:08:29] Mafre1: Sense: good
[3:08:30] Mafre1: Based
[3:08:42] Sokchoy: based sense as usual
[3:08:42] MrDadDude: LOL
[3:08:46] Sokchoy: cringe chicken posting
[3:08:52] MrDadDude: ME playing ele shaman just laughing my ass off reading this shit
[3:09:15] kelly_mac06: but Tettles always complains about balance dps
[3:09:41] Mafre1: The graphs lets go
[3:09:56] Sokchoy: WCL graph time tune in
[3:10:03] theBroHam: I love beating people up for being stupid with data
[3:10:19] Sokchoy: when i take out the good fights my class is bad
[3:10:26] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[3:10:31] LCSpartan: vengence aura for pallys most likely
[3:10:54] wohman: Ret because legendary
[3:10:58] LCSpartan: also that
[3:11:11] keyda16: Hello
[3:11:28] Mafre1: Paladin makes up a big % of the playerbase so thats probably why ret is popular
[3:12:07] dragona92: U're only getting brought once for the buff and that's it tho, unlike DHs and other specs where u can freely bring more than one and not suffer
[3:12:35] REGENAROCKET: @wohman and buffs because its such a popular spec
[3:13:05] Mafre1: Balance only needs buffs if disc starts needing innervate again
[3:13:12] Sokchoy: correct mafre
[3:13:18] Gbear: good morning JB, just wanted to say thank you for shutting down the stupid moonkin gaslighting
[3:14:42] Mafre1: Echo/Method team only based team
[3:15:01] butter51: engaging in conversations with moonkins is a road towards madness. they do not operate like normal people
[3:15:06] Sokchoy: chickens are so fucking cringe
[3:15:46] Guffels: it atleast makes you insanely good if not meta
[3:15:46] Ok_Kingston: moonkins are the hardest sandbaggers ever
[3:16:22] Mafre1: Yarrgidudu best boomie
[3:16:32] LCSpartan: nerf barkskin for boomies
[3:16:49] CyonDru: boomie just needs a smidge more survivability
[3:16:53] CyonDru: it’s fine on damage
[3:16:58] Mafre1: dodo? DansGame
[3:17:10] zebracak35: zaelia did when pallys were nuts
[3:17:16] zebracak35: erm yea ellemsere not zelia
[3:17:25] Mafre1: Did jdotb do this when resto druid was broken
[3:17:38] Gbear: season 1 ashen hollow
[3:17:39] Sokchoy: rdruid was never good in mplus mafre hes been suffering for years
[3:17:54] CyonDru: true and real
[3:18:24] Mafre1: Dont open twitter
[3:19:10] kelly_mac06: then ppl ignore you all the time bc they know you're a fucking clown
[3:19:37] kelly_mac06: tettles falls into clown category at this point with anything related to balance druid
[3:19:40] Ok_Kingston: JB winning twitter again
[3:19:45] the_pyke: Restro Druid is stronk af but it could be better :D
[3:20:21] Dissperia: true friends call each others shit out
[3:20:35] Rypick: lol
[3:20:38] LCSpartan: its one of those things that it all varies in the type of content you are doing
[3:20:45] flawlesslykun: the only thing that tilts me ever since legion ended, is that pugging on my mage has become less and less fun (except maybe last season before they nerfed fire)
[3:20:58] dragona92: He does say when balance is overpowered, but not on twitter... Like on his streams he does say "yeah we were pretty broken" quite often, but u gotta follow him on all shit to get it
[3:21:04] Finkl_: i remember when feral was good for the first time in 5 years during season 1 and the chickens lost their minds over it
[3:21:16] fromthecrypt55: The problem with boomkin is there are too many of them that are trash.
[3:21:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:21:47] theBroHam: @fromthecrypt55 I did a 21 with a boomie that did 85k dps
[3:21:51] LCSpartan: @fromthecrypt55 thats also true
[3:21:52] menzlo: Should specs be balanced around wf keys or .1% or top 10% keys
[3:21:54] flawlesslykun: ppl love to call u dogshit when they literaly don't do anything to help a affix, or a interrupt or crowd control, zero. just call the fire mage a dogshit player KEKW
[3:22:11] kondelol: xdd
[3:22:31] dragona92: @Finkl_ Who? KEKL I'm a druid main and I never favour one spec over the other, I like all of them and I like when one is actually good in the eyes of the public
[3:22:32] reggiepowa: 3 of those keys arent even 29
[3:22:35] flawlesslykun: "oh u combusting? lemme just insta move away from your flamestrikes" 4Head
[3:22:46] FrostmagicED: specs should be balanced around +15's send tweet
[3:22:59] menzlo: Community perception?
[3:23:00] Sokchoy: 4 keys are 3 are bullshit
[3:23:00] RemwayTV: so depressing pugging and pushing - losing motivation seeing 5 keys all with healers already in finder T_T
[3:23:02] menzlo: Ya
[3:23:02] Rypick: is he fighting the argument of aoe vs single target
[3:23:12] flawlesslykun: YEP
[3:23:17] flawlesslykun: they literaly destroyed fire mage
[3:23:22] flawlesslykun: because of ppl bitching
[3:23:40] LCSpartan: perception is a HUGE issue in WoW
[3:23:49] Finkl_: @dragona92 people over dreamgrove but mostly Goopd on twitter lol it was hilarious
[3:24:43] weezie_61: So, what your saying is Blizz Buffs/Nerfs based off community perception vs actual data?
[3:24:50] dragona92: @Finkl_ Goop is trolling 90% of the time, but if u're listening to dreamgrove other than the people with the sims (and even they can be questionable) then u're in for a ride... There's always animosity in those channels, so it's not even worth bothering being there
[3:25:07] LCSpartan: @weezie_61 part of that is game development for an MMO game
[3:25:24] flawlesslykun: last thing i will say about fire mages, yes it does insane damage, if you have a whole party playing around you.... go play fire mage in a pug and see how unfun and tilted you are by the end of that key
[3:25:38] FrostmagicED: hm
[3:25:48] flawlesslykun: and ofc, get insulted and called a trash player classic
[3:26:06] dragona92: @flawlesslykun Honestly feels like most mage specs are like that
[3:26:26] Sokchoy: hmm yes i can clearly see the data
[3:26:39] DisgracedDuke: literally no sustain
[3:26:44] josh_is_chillin: I maxed out my balance druid in terms of gear and IO based on how much effort I want to put in to the game to go higher so I am trying out resto......it has 1 billion buttons and CDs to manage since the last time I tried resto.
[3:26:47] dabbyqq: laughs in enhance
[3:27:02] imjebb: donki impression
[3:27:05] flawlesslykun: @dragona92 YEP but fire is the one that gets hurt the most when ppl can't do a affix/ interrupt / CC without any doubts... because the dmg window is so short (even tho they increased skb timer now)
[3:27:08] LCSpartan: dude bearform is fucking broken when you look at it as a defensive
[3:27:19] FrostmagicED: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/35#metric=deaths&timespan=60
[3:27:21] FrostmagicED: @jdotb fixed it
[3:27:35] domz_i: Sitting in bear form doing nothing is bleh
[3:27:46] apertured_wizard: wild that a class with a lot of damage in its dots wont use two globals to go bear forms lmao
[3:27:47] DisgracedDuke: every top tier boomie uses bear form and hates every second of it
[3:27:51] menzlo: Yeah they say DPS loss
[3:27:51] kenjataimuz: be like a mage saying "i can't dps in ice block so it's a shit defensive"
[3:27:53] FrostmagicED: new partition probably borked it
[3:27:54] siokeee: druid only class that have a defensive allways up and refuse to use it
[3:28:03] CyonDru: that is some artwork
[3:28:49] LCSpartan: @menzlo its a big DPS loss to die on the boss xD
[3:29:05] dragona92: @kenjataimuz Thing is tho - it was an immunity, when they had it... Bear form is by no means an immunity so u get punished as if it's ice block but u don't get all the benefits of ice block (removing everything plus immune to all dam while in it)
[3:29:14] ExtreemeCheese: Feral is harder than people think
[3:29:22] Sokchoy: i remember when everyone became invincible on january 25th
[3:29:32] menzlo: Those boomkins are being babysat by disc and aug?
[3:29:34] treavorthenusance: bearform is unknown to boomies
[3:29:34] P4weZ: @ExtreemeCheese easy pick hard master :)
[3:29:44] nekroblights: Very true Jdot, when DPS participate in their own survival they survive.
[3:30:23] impure2k: @ExtreemeCheese feral its not hard, the problem its that it does negative dmg compared to balance
[3:30:35] FrostmagicED: they don't do the massive AoE
[3:30:36] rallevapex: isnt it just priest and evoker giving externals to the druid to survive?
[3:30:41] FrostmagicED: none of the high keys dont do the tehc
[3:30:42] DisgracedDuke: I think there is a great clip of dorki bearforming every 3 seconds in BRH
[3:30:48] FrostmagicED: &
[3:30:50] Okizoo: all you are doing is highlighting the difference between a group that has synergy, coms and can play around an individual class, and putting it against the majority playerbase in pugs.
[3:30:50] FrostmagicED: what duke said
[3:30:52] FrostmagicED: its good
[3:31:10] Okizoo: this is not an accurate breakdown of data
[3:31:17] FrostmagicED: @Okizoo right; but if the majority of the playerbase is trying to do infinitely scaling content it doesn't need a buff to get ther eit needs to play better
[3:31:23] FrostmagicED: in the words of Ion "That's a skill issue"
[3:31:35] Cruzerthebruzer: WM
[3:31:37] Okizoo: @FrostmagicED i can agree with that
[3:31:39] Cruzerthebruzer: Oh those are fort
[3:31:41] weezie_61: just use the filter
[3:32:13] menzlo: Does it require babysitting?
[3:32:28] Okizoo: this argument assumes there are classes that cannot survive when synergized with a full group.
[3:32:38] RemwayTV: thing with druid and bal/bear is requiring preemptiveness rather than the typical late defensives you find from some dps
[3:32:39] weezie_61: Frenzied Regen OP as fuk
[3:32:41] Okizoo: thats a HUGE assumption for the smallest data set in the player base
[3:32:43] caine4646: aye the boomer stream lets gooooo
[3:32:44] CyonDru: I think the point of the complaint is they have to do no dps in order to live while others can still dps while using them
[3:32:47] jeppsont: the fact that mages have an aoe shield makes 0 sense to me
[3:33:01] whiskeyhide: feral gets survival instincts though ya
[3:33:16] davaIon: didn't balance armor just get nerfed too
[3:33:17] whiskeyhide: i swear melee way easier to live most keys this season
[3:33:24] Okizoo: I hear this from both sides, I feel it from tettles side
[3:33:26] StreamElements: restreaming live every day to https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[3:33:26] LCSpartan: i also think theres an argument to be made that the classes they are bringing also help suplement their mitigation as well and are building comps around the boomies
[3:33:42] Alexxu: ber = no dmg/heal
[3:34:00] kenjataimuz: mage ice block, hunter turtle
[3:34:05] whiskeyhide: also bear form out of cooldowns is meh so what
[3:34:09] jeppsont: its not like you have to wait for 4 stacks like shaman KEKW
[3:34:10] menzlo: Just push trees
[3:34:50] Sokchoy: damn his brain growing 3 sizes today
[3:35:04] LCSpartan: "some of you will die and thats a sacrafice i am willing to make
[3:35:59] menzlo: Good for one shots not great for rot
[3:36:11] kondelol: frenzy regen is so good
[3:36:20] kfieldzeus: You are not sitting in bear and lose 1-2 gcd xD you are trolling haha.
[3:36:37] kondelol: xD
[3:36:42] whiskeyhide: xD
[3:36:43] holtrop: xdd
[3:37:00] treavorthenusance: dps player try not to complain about not pressing dmg buttons challange impossible
[3:37:00] kondelol: 2 globals or I lose incarn die xD
[3:37:07] kfieldzeus: Nono I sit in bear, im saying its more off a loss. :)
[3:37:08] the_pyke: i wish a druid can choose his "normal" Form ... so you hav to cast the Human Form
[3:37:13] noewon: YEP just heal me bro
[3:37:20] Sokchoy: wish my healers would fucking heal me instead
[3:37:21] holtrop: wanna keep those gcd's so they can blame the healer/blizz
[3:37:26] Sokchoy: instead of doing 30k dps in cat
[3:37:30] DisgracedDuke: so alternative is death and not having a normal sustain like all the others 🤔
[3:37:35] Nichalicious: Arent most higher keys this tier just live and we will be fine on time? For the most part
[3:37:41] treavorthenusance: im guessing these boomies also cant cc as well? that takes gcd's as well
[3:37:56] CyonDru: as someone who has pushed boomie it is pretty annoying but it’s not as drastic as ppl claim
[3:38:01] kfieldzeus: Yeah im guessing its more healer issue in like 25-27s that forces me to sit longer than needed idk.
[3:38:19] ghantous: isint that part of the reason people play druid to begin with is the multiple forms, but they just wanna cast just play mage idk
[3:38:26] CyonDru: it is just annoying looking at peers who don’t need to sacrifice dps to use a defensive
[3:38:50] siokeee: padders everywhere
[3:38:52] DisgracedDuke: isnt game like balanced around ppl having cooldowns? whats the point of bearform then?

[3:39:02] siokeee: overall is the only that mathers
[3:39:14] Cruzerthebruzer: This is probably more raid but ravenous frenzy going away when you swap out of bear is kinda lame
[3:39:17] siokeee: no one cares of completing a key
[3:39:17] menzlo: A talent that lets you retain form effects from a few seconds
[3:39:27] treavorthenusance: or 4 seconds after leaving
[3:39:27] kfieldzeus: Its just meh cuz other classes just press 1 button thats a low cd and they keep blasting while I gotta sit in bear to not die cuz bark on cd.
[3:39:33] treavorthenusance: and stays on in form
[3:39:40] siokeee: druid the only class that has a defensive always up and complaing about using it rolf
[3:39:43] holtrop: does that talent have an icd?
[3:40:05] Cruzerthebruzer: pvp has 0 positive impacts on pve and plenty of negative ones just remove it
[3:40:16] whiskeyhide: rogue basically perma up
[3:40:19] Guffels: dk tree lol
[3:40:22] Guffels: 10% stam nodes
[3:40:25] CyonDru: should completely separate pvp shit
[3:40:26] StreamElements: R1 tweets confirmed by RaiderIO CarlSmile www.twitter.com/jdotb
[3:40:26] Finkl_: @siokeee many specs have passive stuff as strong as bear form
[3:40:29] CyonDru: its dead anyway
[3:40:30] kondelol: xD dps dk has 1m
[3:40:31] FrostmagicED: imagine if
[3:40:37] FrostmagicED: blizzard remade a game JUST for pvp
[3:41:26] ghantous: they can just put the typical "does not apply in pvp combat" yall need to relax lol
[3:41:46] FrostmagicED: @ghantous that takes ALOT of coding work and sometimes breaks BADLY (see; Havoc DH)
[3:41:49] CyonDru: @ghantous xdd
[3:42:29] gambitenjoyer: I just feel like theres almost no way they think of that when they add stuff
[3:42:41] gambitenjoyer: Because thats such an unfun type of gameplay its insane
[3:42:48] yarpx: like if ursine vigor transfered to other forms
[3:43:20] Cruzerthebruzer: Why would a boomkin want to live they're a boomkin
[3:43:25] Cruzerthebruzer: Clearly personality faults
[3:43:25] LCSpartan: living it requires slightly more planning than "press button live"
[3:43:45] menzlo: What was the original protector the pack talent
[3:43:49] menzlo: Back in beta
[3:44:11] siokeee: ill remove the posibility of having a defensive allways up and change it for a 1min cooldown with more dr
[3:44:27] menzlo: It was getting a buff when you switched forms
[3:44:29] qyxiz: wasnt there a talent there that made it so swapping forms gave you free resources
[3:44:31] menzlo: Or something
[3:44:35] CyonDru: was a resource buff
[3:44:37] Finkl_: it was furor
[3:44:41] CyonDru: free casts when shifting forms or something
[3:44:45] menzlo: Oh yeah was reaources
[3:44:48] menzlo: Lmao
[3:44:59] CyonDru: ultra cringe
[3:45:08] Sokchoy: furor
[3:46:42] siokeee: change bear form for a 1 min cooldown with better dr and if youre unlucky with the cast depends on externals like other classes
[3:47:46] Nico_vdM: Furor: When you shift into a form you haven't been in for 20 sec, abilities cost no Rage, Energy, Astral Power, or Mana for 4 seconds.
[3:48:02] menzlo: Stinky
[3:51:36] FrostmagicED: that furor talent
[3:51:41] FrostmagicED: would be SO abusable in raid for rdruid
[3:51:42] FrostmagicED: yes plz
[3:52:06] FrostmagicED: go master shapeshifter and boomkin form for 20 seconds while ur disc priest ramp is covering your raid
[3:52:09] FrostmagicED: get a ton of mana
[3:52:11] FrostmagicED: then go human form
[3:52:33] CyonDru: no thanks
[3:52:46] FrostmagicED: bi
[3:52:47] FrostmagicED: bi 󠀀
[3:52:49] FrostmagicED: no wtf
[3:53:25] yarpx: you could probably tranq right  after charge
[3:57:05] menzlo: Did you watch jak vid with Greg and torty
[3:57:37] blondeads: #ad or genuine interest
[3:57:41] blondeads: jk
[3:57:49] P4weZ: resto druid m+
[3:57:51] treavorthenusance: 34" what 1440p or 4k?
[3:57:54] P4weZ: and raid
[3:57:55] menzlo: Restodruid in df
[3:57:56] CyonDru: resto druid in general
[3:58:04] kelly_mac06: @CyonDru when was this
[3:58:14] CyonDru: several days ago
[3:58:22] CyonDru: i think i brought it up in here but JB donowalled me
[3:58:23] CyonDru: KEKW

[3:59:12] kelly_mac06: @CyonDru i may watch it, a couple days ago i made  facetious comment in a discord about innervate and it brought the wrath of the Dreamgrove down on me
[3:59:19] kelly_mac06: so torty's name gives me ptsd
[3:59:44] Ancient_zx: what's the link to the torty vid?
[3:59:52] CyonDru: @kelly_mac06 wait what is your name in there
[4:00:00] kelly_mac06: what he was saying was 100% CORRECT but like he was wrong in the  context
[4:00:03] Shkafche: @Ancient_zx its on Jacks channel
[4:00:07] CyonDru: i will defend you!
[4:00:17] whiskeyhide: dh discord is the biggest degen idiot collection ive ever seen lol
[4:00:18] kelly_mac06: @CyonDru it was in a different discord- someone actually went and linked it in DG to bring them over to yell
[4:00:31] CyonDru: i just checked my messages, yeah 5 days ago i asked if JB watched it DEADGE
[4:01:05] CyonDru: @kelly_mac06 i know of this incident
[4:01:24] holtrop: feels like druid health could get buffed a bit more looking at that
[4:01:30] treavorthenusance: aug is also super squish as well
[4:01:30] holtrop: not defensives i think thats fine
[4:01:46] CyonDru: i do not like to bring augs
[4:02:44] kelly_mac06: funny enough, the only other interaction i have with DG was asking for resto druid help in keys back in legion
[4:02:47] greyghost512: U not playing with convoke?  Is that just this week or always?
[4:02:52] kelly_mac06: and someone told me to watch JB 's stream
[4:02:54] kelly_mac06: and here we are
[4:03:00] CyonDru: real
[4:03:17] CyonDru: i always recommend JB, roiben or vick jdotbComfy
[4:03:29] CyonDru: would recommend greg if he streamed Madge
[4:03:35] menzlo: Is reforestation worth with incarn?
[4:04:06] Sokchoy: @CyonDru fuck you im an aug main now
[4:04:20] CyonDru: that is so sorry to hear Sok, hope you recover
[4:04:33] CyonDru: are you going aug to buff phased since he is goign warlock or what
[4:05:10] kondelol: Have you ever listened to UMEK?
[4:05:44] zebracak35: i can never find a tank for eb
[4:05:45] kondelol: no xD
[4:05:50] treavorthenusance: tanks no like the red pools
[4:06:21] menzlo: What do you do with tree in keys, rejuv is the only thing that's buffed?
[4:06:42] CyonDru: did you see the post on wowhead about a dev hour every tuesday?
[4:06:47] Minigamer911: Minigamer911 watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Huh
[4:06:49] menzlo: Ya
[4:06:56] menzlo: Haha woo trees
[4:07:27] menzlo: Dees nuts omg
[4:07:27] CyonDru: devour deez nuts
[4:07:29] holtrop: devhour deez nuts
[4:07:30] kelly_mac06: oh god
[4:07:31] CyonDru: gotem
[4:07:32] kfieldzeus: ahh rip
[4:07:33] kelly_mac06: it's a deeznuts
[4:07:39] kondelol: xdd
[4:07:41] kelly_mac06: lmao
[4:07:45] CyonDru: LMAO
[4:07:53] kelly_mac06: that would be fucking awesome
[4:07:53] gofortrekon: getrekt
[4:07:59] CyonDru: dude i did that so poorly and still got you
[4:08:31] Sokchoy: L
[4:08:35] CyonDru: man if only there was an actual dev hour every week
[4:09:28] menzlo: Star citizen does it
[4:10:00] Whitewolf1441: are tanks taking a sanguine break?

[4:13:43] justcappes: well you gotta say the game is pretty empty atm... season was too easy as was the raid
[4:14:23] Tippolski: guardian doom
[4:16:55] whiskeyhide: hunters can absolutely clap
[4:17:02] whiskeyhide: people just think of pure high keys and them dying but mdi yolo
[4:17:08] butter51: hunters blast, we just die
[4:17:29] menzlo: I thought bm was tanky now
[4:19:23] xteintv: Banging out some testing/vault keys on crappy affix week probably.
[4:20:02] xteintv: xteintv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:24:10] CyonDru: lmoa that mage
[4:24:10] menzlo: Use alch stone and attack dummies
[4:24:16] Karemabdual: Bring back 2 hr flask 2024
[4:24:41] DustsoulTV: just vomit a bit :D
[4:24:41] CyonDru: lol
[4:24:43] Karemabdual: I feel you, my favorite is using one then wiping first pull
[4:24:48] menzlo: Puke it up like a mama bird
[4:24:51] YuriKnjY: puke it back
[4:24:52] RocketMan23: just wipe down your sweat after the key and wring it back into the bottle ez
[4:24:52] maenkins: what... like distil your urine?
[4:24:54] gambitenjoyer: LUL put out the joint real quick
[4:24:57] Pyro_Cricket: like world buffs in classic
[4:24:58] gambitenjoyer: save for later
[4:25:00] maldehv: just log out 3head
[4:25:10] buzzkill00: it's like when you have to flask but there's only 10mins left in the raid
[4:25:13] LCSpartan: or just make the flask timer only count down in instanced content
[4:25:15] CyonDru: yeah log out and look for the key on an alt
[4:25:16] CyonDru: Kappa
[4:25:32] menzlo: Vers alch stone
[4:25:56] teqlamage: Any advice on how to stay positive pugging? Because Im about to quit this shit

[4:26:17] ren0m: LUL
[4:26:19] whiskeyhide: LUL
[4:26:31] teqlamage: LUL
[4:26:40] gwildorr_: @teqlamage agree.. just quit bro.. no sense in playing if you aren't having fun.. many of us are still having fun
[4:26:49] LCSpartan: its better to take a step back while you are still in a semi-positive space then come back when the itch comes back
[4:26:54] menzlo: Any advice how to stay positive while being productive in the economy because I'm about to quit this shit
[4:26:56] CyonDru: quit, try a diff role, try another aspect of the game
[4:27:00] teqlamage: That has cheered me up, back to the grind lol
[4:27:16] tradecraft00: nex two weeks the sffixes are better
[4:27:21] ren0m: What other things? Professions?
[4:27:26] yarpx: next 2 weeks the affixs are way better
[4:27:31] ren0m: Tuesday are Alchemy days
[4:27:45] Shkafche: pet battle dungeons r a thing too
[4:28:18] CyonDru: true
[4:28:29] gwildorr_: i get paid tons of money to work at home... but i play wow 12 hours a day.. so i guess it's the same? cause i do ZERO Work on my regular job
[4:28:35] Webchika: I do keys super casually... like I've done 2 20's this season (I mostly do 16-18's on my main) and I hit a point where I don't want to run keys so I can't imagine the High Push Keys
[4:28:38] CyonDru: most days i get paid to watch the stream LUL
[4:28:48] Tfos: @jdotb what did you do before?
[4:29:00] SkewterTheTooter: I was lucky enough to have found a small group of people who are all cool and I get along with who are also on the same skill level. I'd say keep your eyes peeled for the same, a nd just send friend reqs to cool people you find in  pugs, and try to build up your community
[4:29:10] noewon: YEP i get paid to watch JB to play wow.
[4:29:20] Tfos: @jdotb what kind of insurance?
[4:29:33] yarpx: have you run with many spriests since the buffs? do you think they are good in high keys now?
[4:29:52] LCSpartan: ew
[4:31:35] Tfos: ye i know i work in insurance company too LUL
[4:31:55] Tfos: but we do trade credit insurance
[4:32:38] Lumimyrsky: Maybe that's why no one knows anything about anything when I call my insurance. lol
[4:36:08] Webchika: @jdotb In part that honestly sounds a bit like Hospitality Sales / Catering contracts ... I used to be a Front office sup. and I can't tell you how many Sales contracts for corporate room accounts / events whose contracts got thrown the window as soon as they checked in
[4:36:22] buzzkill00: you did the slow quitting before it was meta
[4:36:26] ren0m: Sounds like most lawyer jobs
[4:37:13] LCSpartan: bruh idk why but i thought you worked in IT
[4:37:53] sandecharlie1992: Yo is it hard learning resto drood ?
[4:39:10] Fortearmure: hello jb !
[4:39:12] menzlo: Easier than ever with trees
[4:39:28] Webchika: Hospitality tip of the day (in case you travel for MDI or whatever) If you're traveling in a group that will include 10+ rooms for 2+ nights talk to Hotel sales for a group rate... most of the time you can get a reduced nightly rate + perks like breakfast / internet / etc...
[4:39:31] Whitewolf1441: easy to learn hard to master
[4:39:35] sandecharlie1992: lol got commercial as soon as u started explaining
[4:40:24] kngcoi: Just gotta
[4:40:41] sandecharlie1992: why not ?
[4:41:27] P4weZ: reju is only for stacking mastery
[4:42:05] Webchika: My main char I'm comfortable with is Resto Shaman... Resto Druid & Disc Priest  (though I'm still a newb with it) have been my favorite alts so far this season... But so far I understand them for 5 man stuff and not so much for raid  content lol
[4:42:09] sandecharlie1992: ah ok filler spell
[4:42:25] lillejezus: how did the penitence build on the priest woork out for you ?
[4:42:28] Gerrardfan1: i guess rejuv is a backup for the mastery value or?
[4:42:33] menzlo: Rdruid is gcd capped so not much room for fillers
[4:42:58] sandecharlie1992: Y for sure healed as holy paladin before and m+ was so easy compare to raids
[4:44:21] Lenietwitch: raid is also very scripted right ?, most non healable dmg is a one shot anyway
[4:44:21] Webchika: I have to laugh a bit... I apparently manged to explain resto shaman well enough (in raid context) to help someone go from bottom of the healing meter to being invited to run Mythic with their guild... but at this point I just laugh at myself if I try to play Disc or Druid in raid cause I get my healing ass kicked (though I have fun)
[4:45:00] Fortearmure: Is augure fine for dps as rdruid ?
[4:45:45] Fortearmure: With primal fury and 30% crit, it should be good right ?
[4:46:24] Webchika: Out of Curiosity for Season 4 in DF do you have Dungeons you'd like to see? (Both DF & previous expansion content)
[4:46:50] menzlo: SD
[4:47:05] theBroHam: I thought they said S4 was DF dungeons?
[4:47:33] bonjourdaisy: I miss DF s1 dungeons
[4:47:36] Webchika: Vault would be Fun... I'm weird in that I'd love Cathedral of Eternal night to come back at some point lol

[4:47:42] blue321: Seat of the triumvriate when?
[4:47:56] Tfos: i see you search for 30 so that means you managed the 28 rise?
[4:48:08] lucid_wow: bring back kings rest
[4:48:10] Tippolski: bring back maw
[4:48:13] whiskeyhide: i can never decide if i liked shrine because we had obelisks  to skip the water eles though
[4:48:15] nixar1: @blue321 100% we'll have it in TWW since Alleria will be there
[4:48:15] Tippolski: we want our giga baby key runs
[4:48:19] TyHeals: Did you see they said there will be no affixes in S4?..... yeah me either but wishful thinking
[4:48:27] Webchika: Maw of Souls is 3 pulls lol... Pull to the 1st, Pull to the 2nd, Pull to the  mini boss

[4:49:37] DustsoulTV: aflicted spawning below you KEKW
[4:49:51] Finkl_: pulling shit through walls
[4:49:53] Webchika: Out of curiosity is there a wa or visual setting that makes Sanguine easily seen in Darkheart? Cause I swear it's the same color as the floor
[4:50:09] reggiepowa: shadowlands next expansion probably
[4:50:15] Galois_rg: bring back HoA
[4:50:31] pl0de: I kinda liked the shadowlands dungeons but hated the expansion
[4:50:49] greentechx: SL dungeons are 100% coming in S4, watch!
[4:50:56] theBroHam: I wonder if with the new expac they will redo affixes completely. Would be a good time to revamp
[4:51:22] reggiepowa: @theBroHam every time is a good time to revamp and theya re never doing it, doubt anything major changes
[4:51:39] Webchika: @theBroHam Would be kinda cool if they  there was a Help / Hurt affix set
[4:51:42] swo12: D:
[4:52:00] theBroHam: Fair. Just lost 2k employees, so no one to work on this XD
[4:52:21] lucid_wow: taz gambit owned streets was mid imo
[4:52:26] Tfos: theater last boss was truply pain
[4:52:33] sandecharlie1992: do you rather dps as cat form or balance as resto drood ? what is the strongest ?
[4:52:38] whiskeyhide: i hated theater so much and that was the only key my group ever got
[4:52:40] whiskeyhide: id rather do spires
[4:53:10] pl0de: Sanguine depths was pain
[4:53:29] swo12: hpal EZ Clap
[4:53:31] Tfos: wasnt sanguine a lot about tank and his route?
[4:54:37] toique: best SL dungeon was iron docks
[4:54:52] buzzkill00: i thought SD was a very good dungeon after they made all the changes
[4:55:50] swo12: pugging a 30 monkaS
[4:56:02] Nickystr1x: the design of the bosses was pretty cool, imo
[4:56:17] silentkillervgc: theater of pain on inspiring week was like impossible
[4:56:18] Fortearmure: Trying reforestation instead of budding leaves
[4:56:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[4:57:07] silentkillervgc: ToP on inspiring week, you cant skip them and don't have a room so you have to do the hardest pulls on inspiring without CC
[4:57:13] Webchika: Lol I'm so supposed to be using the hour before I have to leave to meet family to run keys (Trying to get a toon to 2k for giggles)... Instead I'm sitting here listening & reading chat lol
[4:57:35] Bearlocked: Good morning, J.
[4:58:16] Morningstartt: hello there
[4:58:21] Bearlocked: House chores.  You’re in my ear, sir.
[4:58:57] Webchika: I mean it's still useful? Learning stuff... plus finished painting a set of keychain inserts that look like the Candy Conversation hearts for when my next order of resin gets here
[5:00:16] pl0de: Which affix do you think 100% needs to go or be changed?
[5:00:42] buzzkill00: i really hope they take a big swing at m+ and try something for the fated season
[5:01:38] Tfos: healing on afflicted should be boosted so 1 heal would be enough for it then im okay with it
[5:01:39] pl0de: Yeah that's true
[5:02:39] Webchika: I run mostly with a DK tank and am lucky he typically deals with 1 for me same with Incoporeal
[5:02:44] teqlamage: Went away, chilled timed key, jdotbabes for life
[5:02:46] Fairshihtzu: +1
[5:02:59] Nickystr1x: they should give everyone the ability to handle afflicted, and have them have a shadowy duel effect where only you can handle it and only you are affected by it
[5:03:04] Frawtarius: Affixes are good though, they just need to be kiss/curse, not just CBT
[5:03:14] petsas_hero: I'd rather have seasonal than afflicted / sanguine
[5:03:16] TheAntih: the totem boss in throne is pure C with only 2 dispels
[5:03:18] swo12: it adds some variety
[5:03:22] Tfos: wouldnt m+ without affix be blant
[5:03:30] Sizebot: that would require Blizzard to admit to having made something that was bad, and they wont do that
[5:03:35] DayOldBeef: just one positive affix
[5:03:44] DayOldBeef: and the point is fun
[5:03:50] Fairshihtzu: People like to think that affixes actually makes the dungeons more varied. I mean, I guess they're not wrong, but also makes them so not enjoyable its insane
[5:03:52] Webchika: I think a system where there are some beneficial to the player as well as negative would be interesting
[5:04:17] swo12: they're dogshit and annoying but it would be worse without them. just gotta make them positive or fun
[5:04:20] teqlamage: teqlamage subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:04:21] theBroHam: the only way to get dps to do affixes is to make them give a buff
[5:04:34] jeppsont: i sure miss teeming fortified
[5:05:01] CyonDru: yeah id rather no affixes
[5:05:07] Tfos: or give us positive effect after dealing correctly with affix
[5:05:09] CyonDru: it doesnt make anything interesting
[5:05:10] Keynash18: Opinion on old affixes like obelisk
[5:05:20] Webchika: @jeppsont ewwwww... or teaming skittish
[5:05:23] CyonDru: tbh i do not miss a seasonal affix
[5:05:27] Tippolski: wouldn't it be relatively simple to have no affix as a constant separate ladder?
[5:05:40] Tippolski: I feel like that can't be hard to implement.
[5:05:41] greentechx: wouldnt no affixs inflate key levels by making the content easy. so a 30 key now can be ran to 35+ with no affixes?
[5:05:52] CyonDru: @greentechx no lol
[5:06:01] CyonDru: an afffix isnt stopping ppl from doign 32s rn
[5:06:11] RemwayTV: I mean they made quaking not overlap with last boss of academy so they can and do some minor tuning
[5:06:24] RemwayTV: could be easy to make afflcited not spawn during bosses etc
[5:06:25] pl0de: Or even if they just focused on finetuning them more often
[5:06:29] Frawtarius: @greentechx And this matters...why? Just buff the dungeons baseline if the arbitrary upper level of 30 matters so much to you compared to 35 xd
[5:07:50] teqlamage: There's always fucky interactions
[5:08:04] theBroHam: affixes make M+ feel gimmicky rather than truly pushing yourself to beat the dungeon and be better
[5:08:16] pl0de: That's another thing. Rotating dungeons is already kind of the new spice for M+
[5:08:31] swo12: 4Head
[5:08:37] Finkl_: most affixes are just there to annoy people tbh
[5:08:45] Finkl_: it's not like they're hard or rewarding when you get it right
[5:09:00] DrMeat: allow us to add affix, +1 affix = +1 loot at end
[5:09:03] Galois_rg: that number is too big Smadge
[5:09:11] teqlamage: They make it  easier sure, but a hell of a lot more enjoyable to play
[5:09:17] Tippolski: infinitiely scaling content, no benefit over 18-20... scaling harder should not be a concern
[5:09:22] Tippolski: it's literally for e-peen and enjoyment
[5:09:24] RemwayTV: Would you prefer affixes be kiss/curse styled?
[5:09:26] StreamElements: StinkyCheese Hate seeing ads? StinkyCheese Ads support streamers. Sub today for Pog ad-free viewing Pog and exclusive channel emotes. SeemsGood
[5:09:30] OutTester: @DrMeat so I was thinking that but loot won't matter for push groups
[5:09:51] Galois_rg: this is why affixes turbo fucked everyone in season 1, because every beta key was 0 affixes
[5:09:52] OutTester: @OutTester so might as well not have them then
[5:09:58] DrMeat: thats the point, its for a different group of people if it becomes an option
[5:10:13] Obbijuan: I like your idea, but should tyranical stay and just delete the other affixes?
[5:10:38] reggiepowa: a lot of groups were putting both tyra and forti on keys last time I was on ptr
[5:10:39] teqlamage: Would you get rid of tyra and fort?
[5:10:52] Skipwow: As a healer I actively avoid playing on afflicted/raging weeks
[5:11:18] theBroHam: same
[5:11:25] Skipwow: yep
[5:11:26] Galois_rg: false, I like affixes
[5:11:37] Galois_rg: necrotic was pog
[5:11:41] Galois_rg: original explosive was pog
[5:11:45] TyHeals: HUGE fan of tyran 1 shots
[5:11:49] cbaprod: I'm giving this guy a timeout soon^
[5:11:58] blue321: Isn't part of the challenge of m+ for it to be difficult, which affixes does?
[5:11:58] Obbijuan: fortyfied or tyranical seems okay
[5:12:04] Soptik78: i fking hate affixes, its all bullsht
[5:12:04] greentechx: teaming was the bomb y0
[5:12:08] CyonDru: @cbaprod was about to pull out my hammer
[5:12:17] Skipwow: The variety is helpful the weeks full so different
[5:12:17] Galois_rg: tyrannical needs to go down by 10%
[5:12:26] Skipwow: feel*
[5:12:27] CyonDru: i do like fort and tyran i think
[5:12:28] Skyfall715: seasonal affixes were the only ones that were ever good. S3 shadowlands was great for that
[5:12:39] Skyfall715: but they got rid of them after thundering sucked haha
[5:12:46] Galois_rg: we should just have rotating weekly affixes from the pool of good seasonal affixes
[5:12:47] theBroHam: thundering was poop haha
[5:13:06] teqlamage: any majorly punishing mechanics should be removed
[5:13:27] LeOtcan: Some weeks some classes literally have to quit the game. i feel useless with my alt warrior on afflicted + corp weeks. you gotta put something to classes so they can deal with the affix whole week.
[5:13:43] Ionized4: wouldnt it be way better if fort/tyran were replaced with old good seasonals like awakened/encrypted weeks
[5:13:55] theBroHam: I think ti's stupid that they made affixes that certain classes can literally do nothing for
[5:14:10] clickermekk: 2nd boss in throne of tides knockback ability same time as incorp spawn
[5:14:28] flawlesslykun: @theBroHam ^ this 100%. and the toxicity it breeds is insane too
[5:15:03] swo12: bring back corruption, make diff corruption the positive affixes each week. TDEV week Pog
[5:15:07] DrMeat: they fuck that up every new set of dungeon releases when they find out there are abilities that scale too hard
[5:15:29] nicht_oli__: remove all affixes theres a reason why all old keys are the most played m+ dungeons , less bullshit
[5:15:36] Yarn__: yeah it feels bad not wanting to play for 2 weeks straight when you pay to play the game
[5:16:22] TheAntih: didnt blizzard had a testing team?
[5:16:45] Ayije: they could easily invite some  teams to playtest tho
[5:16:52] flawlesslykun: @Yarn__ YEP
[5:17:01] spoon_rl: I just wish there were better rewards for doing higher keys, Myth track past 25s or more gold or something
[5:17:05] CyonDru: imagine them testking keys that most dont even do lmao
[5:17:06] Galois_rg: I would love for my job to be testing keys
[5:17:07] Galois_rg: I would do it
[5:17:17] drumminbacon: Even then they have to disable volcanic for bosses that require you to stand still. like Shadowmoon Burial ground worm boss
[5:17:29] Ayije: ptr is always a half bugged half unfinished mess
[5:17:46] Sizebot: "here, come test on the PTR so we can ignore all your feedback". -Blizzard
[5:17:58] theBroHam: Here's a metaphor for you: I like golf. Golf is hard. To make golf harder, I can increase the difficulty by moving back a tee box. Or, I can have Blizzard tell me to make golf harder, I can move back a tee box and I will get struck by lightning every 10 minutes. One is cool, the other feels shitty and meaningless.
[5:18:11] Ayije: i think some teams couldnt care less if they did all content already just to help with tuning
[5:18:21] Ayije: we are running same keys daily for 4 months anyway
[5:18:35] zanis_: Dungeons would quickly get stale without affixes.
[5:18:49] Yarn__: it gets stale when its unplayable
[5:18:55] Yarn__: 30 brh with sang

[5:19:07] flawlesslykun: 100% jb. and after legion ended, if they didn't learn from that exact mistake u just described, i hope microsoft just fired those ppl ngl KEKW
[5:19:19] Orgabism: They like their randomness mate, they want things to go wrong
[5:19:26] CyonDru: whats stale is me havnig to choose to dispel a mob or a party member
[5:19:33] CyonDru: or ccing some cringe mob durnig a mechanic
[5:19:33] zanis_: How many people are doing 30's ?  You honestly think they are going to tune this game for the minority of people doing 30s?
[5:19:46] drumminbacon: they can have NDA on their closed betas.
[5:20:04] Yarn__: its not about it being a 30 for less experienced groups its still annoying
[5:20:35] zanis_: annoying != unplayable
[5:21:03] buzzkill00: yea nowadays we walk into a dungeon at the start of a season already knowing whether this dungeon is easy or we're about to get butt fucked
[5:21:10] CyonDru: why would anyone want to willingly play w affixes @zanis_
[5:21:12] Yarn__: my point is if it affects any playerbase its a problem
[5:21:18] Ayije: new cook
[5:21:22] zanis_: So it doesn't get boring @CyonDru
[5:21:27] spoon_rl: Annoying does equal unplayabel when your class cant interact with the affix and youre benched for 2 straight weeks
[5:21:42] CyonDru: thats subjective tho @zanis_
[5:21:48] Yarn__: hot take lol
[5:21:53] zanis_: What class is benched for two straight weeks?
[5:22:01] spoon_rl: Warrior
[5:22:10] drumminbacon: @cyondru they don’t know what they’re talking about. guarantee details shows them not ccing, interrupting or using defensives
[5:22:13] zanis_: So if you're a warrior you can't play?
[5:22:17] zanis_: Is that what yer saying?
[5:22:22] nicht_oli__: ret pala mdi meta LUL
[5:22:29] CyonDru: why would i invite a warrior for incorp or afflicted
[5:22:33] CyonDru: when i can invite a shaman
[5:22:38] Hellgrinnnn: f mage 100k from the rogs, makes me feel a bit better
[5:22:42] spoon_rl: It makes it significantly harder to fin groups willing to push keys with yes
[5:22:42] zanis_: Becuase you can invite other classes that can do it?
[5:22:46] zanis_: I this hard to understand?
[5:22:51] spoon_rl: Wow man
[5:22:51] CyonDru: and you dont see a problem w that?
[5:22:55] Yarn__: lol
[5:22:57] CyonDru: w a class that cant do anything about an affix?
[5:22:57] Yarn__: this guy
[5:22:59] zanis_: Not at all
[5:23:00] spoon_rl: You are delusional
[5:23:13] zanis_: Or you're living in a world where you want everything catered for you
[5:23:23] CyonDru: affixes are stale and boring and add nothign to gameplay
[5:23:35] zanis_: I would agree to disagree @CyonDru
[5:23:38] Yarn__: what level of keys do you do @zanis_ because at a low enough lvl it doesnt matter too much
[5:23:40] Hellgrinnnn: can you check his bust uptime plz
[5:23:40] CyonDru: its an old system that needs to be removed until its reinvented
[5:23:48] CyonDru: if you actively enjoy ccing an incorp you are lying
[5:23:53] zanis_: I'm doing 24's - I main a Lock
[5:24:14] CyonDru: oh i love ccing an incorp after pooping tyrant
[5:24:20] CyonDru: popping*
[5:24:20] Yarn__: yeah it doesnt matter too much there w/ comms but without the avg person that hops on to play it could be frustrating
[5:24:21] CyonDru: very fun
[5:24:27] yctnm: I like mind controlling incorps, but thats just because it actually gives value
[5:24:31] Lara_TV_: @CyonDru So that's where the tyrants come from
[5:24:32] zanis_: I mean you're take isn't fun - doesn't bother me
[5:24:39] CyonDru: @Lara_TV_ LMAO mistype man
[5:24:42] zanis_: I just take it as a challenge to playing
[5:24:45] Lara_TV_: Hahahahah I kno
[5:24:46] CyonDru: its not hard
[5:24:51] CyonDru: those are not hard they are just annoying
[5:24:56] gambitenjoyer: ccing an incorp isnt a challenge lol
[5:25:00] gambitenjoyer: just obnoxious
[5:25:03] Hellgrinnnn: yeah that's in my range, doing 28 also
[5:25:07] gambitenjoyer: so is kiting around sang
[5:25:12] Hellgrinnnn: so it is normal !
[5:25:18] CyonDru: have to choose between a dispel on a party memeber or dispel some cringe affix
[5:25:23] CyonDru: LUL
[5:25:23] zanis_: Look not trying to be a dick and argue these are just my points - I feel that getting rid of affixes would make the game to predictable.
[5:25:40] gambitenjoyer: ?
[5:25:46] CyonDru: could argue it already is and the affixes do not spice it up as much as you think
[5:25:53] gambitenjoyer: Theres literally WAs for incorp timers, you know exactly when there spawning etc
[5:25:53] zanis_: Could be
[5:25:56] gambitenjoyer: its already "predictable"
[5:25:57] CyonDru: you must like to add jsut plain salt to your chicken if thats the case
[5:26:22] spoon_rl: When a class needs to utilize their utility to deal with a affix and then does not have that utility to then deal with the actual dungeon that is not engaging gameplay
[5:26:31] gambitenjoyer: theres nothing that actually isnt predictable in the affixes bro lol
[5:26:36] Yarn__: no thats too predictable @CyonDru
[5:26:38] CyonDru: i will steer off this topic now
[5:26:50] zanis_: Ah not yelling
[5:26:54] theBroHam: @CyonDru I like plain boiled chicken with no seasoning Smadge
[5:27:00] zanis_: People are up in me for saying I think affixes should stay
[5:27:03] butter51: i can assure you they don't know either
[5:27:12] sgtshellshocka: I like turtles
[5:27:14] CyonDru: i am not up in you lmao that is poor choice of words
[5:27:17] Yarn__: LUL
[5:27:18] CyonDru: monkaS
[5:27:19] spoon_rl: Just a convo, not an argument
[5:27:29] theBroHam: spirited debate
[5:27:31] spoon_rl: Lets gooo
[5:27:31] gambitenjoyer: well i was just vibing and homie was like super confident in his take when he contradicts himself so had 2 say something at that point
[5:27:32] skiboots: KEKW
[5:27:34] zanis_: LoL @CyonDru good point haha wrong word choice
[5:27:36] supzfly: n you're not!
[5:27:45] CyonDru: @zanis_ LUL
[5:27:54] CyonDru: bout to be emote only mode in this joint
[5:27:54] Orgabism: The current affixes not good, they could make affixes that are fun and positive, not only bad ones, reaping was interesting
[5:27:55] theBroHam: wait let's all go back to bashing boomies
[5:28:05] theBroHam: We can agree on that lol
[5:28:20] CuroDaan: !drops
[5:29:01] MoleDude: raid had affixes for fated season and it was generally hated pretty sure
[5:29:04] Lara_TV_: the only successful affixes have been the good seasonal ones, and technically part of their value is diminished with rotating dungeons now
[5:29:05] zanis_: let me get your thoughts on this  (regarding no affixes)
[5:29:14] skiboots: classic
[5:29:17] spoon_rl: Imagine if Fyrak had afflicted as an affix lmfao
[5:29:24] walkinginyourshoes: add affixes to pvp, that will blow up nicely
[5:29:28] zanis_: With no affixes you go into a dungeon, press the same buttons and stand in the same places every time.  Every week the strat is the same and nothing changes.
[5:29:33] gambitenjoyer: lets add bolstering to raid!
[5:29:39] gambitenjoyer: it makes it more challenging! Kappa
[5:29:45] huuskers: Affixes suck and should go away. Fort and tyrannical are not the absolute worst. But the rest are. I would prefer nothing at all.
[5:29:46] zanis_: With affixes you're forced to change that up and make different choices.
[5:30:06] gambitenjoyer: LOL
[5:30:17] gambitenjoyer: that is true tho
[5:30:21] Shkafche: @lirklol is that leak for the fated season? XD lol /s
[5:30:22] gambitenjoyer: a company after all
[5:30:27] Ionized4: iI have never looked at the affixes on a key and been excited about the affixes on it, regardless of if they're easy or hard but even more dreadful if they're hard
[5:30:51] gambitenjoyer: ^
[5:31:05] gambitenjoyer: exact point some people really dont even look at the affixes and just cba to play when there shit
[5:31:08] gambitenjoyer: thats prob alot of the community
[5:31:11] CyonDru: oh boy! its raging and entangling week, i can hardly wait to load up my key jdotbComfy
[5:31:15] zebracak35: there isnt customer service people any more. problem fixed
[5:31:21] CyonDru: i cannot wait to press my soothe
[5:31:46] Ionized4: "oh look, my everbloom has bolstering!  it will be so much more rewarding if we time this!" - nobody
[5:32:12] Jolvii: instead of affixes, i'd be more inclined to spend time on alternative specs/classes do keys on them instead - gives variation in a different way
[5:32:26] Jolvii: dont need variation from affixes
[5:32:29] gammerinno: sup master J, hope all is well. Which trinkets should I be farming as an m+ healer
[5:32:36] spoon_rl: Im sure there are ways to change up routing for dungeons without requiring something as intrusive as affixes are in the current state
[5:32:37] Sizebot: Blizzard has said they view affixes as the "mythic raid mechanic" of m+. To them, affixes are not supposed to be "fun" or "beneficial". They are intended to be a challenge, frustrating or otherwise.
[5:32:46] zanis_: @jdotb honestly asking (no snark here) You'd rather do the same dungeon every day, same strat, same route, same everything every single day/week?
[5:33:04] Maplewindz: I think I would love it.
[5:33:04] BuurmanDeBuurman: @Sizebot so the actual dungeon mechancis are...?
[5:34:16] Vitaminw1: @zanis_ fair question
[5:34:31] tweed_13: its not reasonable to be forced to stop pushing key level just because of affixes. but this is how it currently works
[5:34:33] Maplewindz: @zanis_ Like every other game? Fuck yeah
[5:34:49] greentechx: one huge benefit of no affix is no more excluding classes because they dont work well with certain affixes.
[5:34:58] s_dawg1: Rather then remove affixes I would like them to try and give us like 3 chances before a key depletes
[5:34:58] justbeachi: they should add affixes to mythic raid and watch how fast they'd remove that shit lmao
[5:34:59] zanis_: So once you've mastered the dungeon where's the challenge ?
[5:35:10] yuriah726: @zanis_ Higher key level
[5:35:11] Lara_TV_: Trying to get the next level
[5:35:13] Vitaminw1: @zanis_ speed and key levels
[5:35:13] spoon_rl: The challenge is optimization
[5:35:17] Lara_TV_: That's the point of the infinite scaling
[5:35:25] drumminbacon: @zanis_ you aren’t mastering anything. guarantee it
[5:35:28] Lara_TV_: Yeah or same key faster if the next one is literally impossible
[5:35:39] Karemabdual: Legion was like that, dungeon wise. I never got tired of the dungeons
[5:35:48] Orgabism: I agree

[6:09:47] chrisppy1996: do you think sanguine will be a better affix if instead of healing the add, it gives it like a damage increase or a health increase instead of the healing?
[6:09:58] zanis_: I'd like to see you more back in the MDI scene personally.
[6:10:21] Karemabdual: @chrisppy1996 You are describing old bolstering
[6:10:25] Lara_TV_: I think they should remove Sanguine, but imo the easy fix is to cap the TOTAL amount of healing each pool can do to a small % of the original mob's Max HP.

[6:10:51] zanis_: I think Blizz did him wrong imo.
[6:10:59] heyshanna: @kelly_mac06 things are good! It’s nice to see you lovely ❤️
[6:11:00] Sombregard: MDI casters are so meh, beside Nagurra.
[6:11:05] Sombregard: I can't stand the others
[6:11:18] Sombregard: They say too much random stupid shit
[6:11:27] nicht_oli__: you can always identify as something else to get a caster spot Kappa
[6:11:28] zebracak35: @heyshanna glossy hoodies? I prefer matte myself
[6:11:44] heyshanna: zeb pls
[6:11:56] ottomr1990: sanguine's biggest problem is that it forces mob movement, which sometimes is just out of your control no matter how well you play.
[6:12:17] Vitaminw1: i heard there are no affixes in SoD
[6:12:20] ottomr1990: the actual effect it does is kinda irrelevant because that will always be a problem
[6:12:26] StreamElements: fresh youtube shorts going up 3x a week on https://www.youtube.com/@jdotb
[6:12:31] nicht_oli__: sanguine and casters is the best written love story in gaming history
[6:12:33] CasualDev: You don't ever play another side game while playing queue simulator?
[6:12:59] ottomr1990: i suppose they could make it get the raging treatment where it doesn't effect anything lvl 71 or higher
[6:13:15] spanqt: how do we like Rsham after buffs guys?
[6:13:18] Morningstartt: yo jb what happened the mdi thing u joining?
[6:14:00] nicht_oli__: those group calls were far better than the casters anyway
[6:14:01] Sombregard: I talked to Mike Ibarra about bringing JdotB back into caster scene. He said if he was still in charge he would....Oh wait...
[6:15:24] Sombregard: @nicht_oli__ Yes, that was better content than the actual mdi stream
[6:16:56] Sombregard: As a caster or playing?
[6:17:30] flawlesslykun: @Sombregard caster in RWF, player in MDI
[6:18:33] flawlesslykun: KEKW TRUE
[6:18:42] Cruzerthebruzer: I bet RWF is fun but prepping 12 characters and farm and boosts sounds so miserable
[6:18:54] ottomr1990: making 12 characters just to find out which one gets better luck in splits is a war crime
[6:18:55] flawlesslykun: jmy was playing around 10 demon hunters dude
[6:18:58] flawlesslykun: fuck no
[6:19:00] flawlesslykun: HELL NO
[6:19:08] Sombregard: But you did a MDI not so long ago, I still remember the angel meme
[6:19:21] Vitaminw1: what games do u play when wow just isnt cutting it
[6:19:22] CasualDev: Yeah....the race takes some degen behavior
[6:20:18] Vitaminw1: so youre telling me i have to go hang out with my wife when I dont want to do any keys?
[6:20:22] xxpoperx: is 6 mastery really fine to heal highkeys ? @jdotb
[6:20:39] kelly_mac06: you played a ton of Rumble
[6:21:09] levents: Why tranq, and incarnation, no convoke?
[6:21:09] Sombregard: @Vitaminw1 you make it sounds like a chore LUL
[6:21:12] ottomr1990: warcraft rumble was so fun for the first few days until you realized how quickly you get gapped by the people that drop hundreds of dollars on it
[6:23:10] flawlesslykun: classic clickbaiters
[6:23:46] theBroHam: @xxpoperx I mean, he's been healing up to a 30, so...

[6:26:36] theBroHam: Did you ever consider being a lawyer, because you love tearing apart arguments so much and so well you can do my job for me
[6:27:09] ren0m: You could say the opposite if it was 10 different Boomkin players - then no matter the player, the class is strong enough that anyone can play it.
[6:27:13] Cruzerthebruzer: Did you ever practice at all?  Debt must've sucked
[6:27:39] theBroHam: oh shit, didn't know you had a JD
[6:28:28] Cruzerthebruzer: I cannot stand debt hanging over my head i get it
[6:29:01] ren0m: So in the US, if you want a degree, you're going to be paying for that for 5-10y?
[6:29:18] theBroHam: hahahahahahaha
[6:29:19] Soptik78: its always kinda sad for me to hear how the debts for studying hit young people hard in the US

[6:29:41] theBroHam: i did undergrad and law school and will be paying for 25 years probably
[6:30:34] theBroHam: and my husband doesn't have a degree so I guess it balances?
[6:30:39] Soptik78: well all schools are free where i live up to a PhD
