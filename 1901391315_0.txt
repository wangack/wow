[0:20:51] viirracocha: Untoucheble
[0:20:52] PermaGrinnn: ....read
[0:21:19] PermaGrinnn: the retail title would be "I'd rather be in Classic" :P
[0:21:22] dslims: Yeah thats what i was asking, The whole server is if you die your character is gone, like in Diablo 3
[0:21:24] JuanTuan: About a 1.5month gap
[0:21:39] Sivain: Title.. better late then never
[0:22:00] JuanTuan: Small Indie Company XD
[0:22:04] dslims: Nice, there has been an entire community doing that for a few years.
[0:22:06] JattixTV: I doubt it, I think HC servers will be good for awhile. I mean people like the challenge and people will wanna test themselves
[0:22:23] PermaGrinnn: they cant even fix collision volumes in BGs
[0:22:36] spansonite1: <3 PogChamp sup swifty
[0:22:43] dslims: @JattixTV Yeah it will fall out once they get to raids.
[0:22:43] spansonite1: swiffer crew!
[0:22:46] Araxxia: Swifty i would wait its just not working right at the moment
[0:22:57] neevir: they probably spent all the time for proofing exploits and weird quests
[0:23:15] thedrdevious: wayfinder is having issues rn tons of login errors
[0:23:20] JattixTV: wayfinder was a good game if you are into the style of game it is. I was in the closed alphas and it was good. Very grindy

[0:24:22] NelsonGamingShow: i tried swifty shoulder stretches' my hands fell off and cant type Kappa
[0:24:36] JattixTV: It is made by Digital Extremes and they made Warframe so it is being developed by a good game developer
[0:24:51] dslims: What do you think the easiest toon to get to 60 as, i think the warlock is the one. If you have skill the mage is.
[0:24:56] PermaGrinnn: you get so distracted so easily, i will surprised if you get 60 without dying :D here is hoping ;)
[0:25:21] JattixTV: Ya cross platform
[0:25:23] PermaGrinnn: hunt / lock
[0:25:29] Gizimoo86: launch problems like every mmo game
[0:25:35] spansonite1: i cant wait to play WoW when i buy a new computer!
[0:25:51] JattixTV: Swifty will make it to 60, even if I have to protect him the whole time lol
[0:26:50] Karlhto: mitch did it to 60
[0:27:16] Gizimoo86: yeah but you die at 60 and loose it
[0:27:16] mikael_jansson90: @Karlhto he bought him self to 60 ;)
[0:28:03] JattixTV: The addon felt to restrictive to a normal style of HC gameplay in every other game. The addon drained the fun from the HC challenge for me, but the official servers have me really craving it again
[0:28:05] Fayrone: is the new honor system online ?
[0:28:08] l4t33d: h?
[0:28:28] Gizimoo86: classic needs classic+, hardcore still small population and will decrease a lot after one month
